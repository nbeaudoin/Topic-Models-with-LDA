       "'\\tWhen was the last time any of us ventured into the Hebrew Bible book of Leviticus?  Probably not recently, if ever.  It seldom shows up in the Common Lectionary texts, the three-year cycle of scripture readings that we share with other Protestant and Catholic churches. This book from Jewish scriptures is the middle book in the ancient Torah, the five books of Jewish law.  As Christians, this is part of our holy scripture.  But I wouldn’t be surprised if you were wondering why!  It’s a meticulous and tedious list of rules, to be blunt. First section: numerous details about the role of priests and the rituals for the temple.  Little of this is observed in the Jewish community today because the ritual of temple sacrifice stopped in 70 AD with the final destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.  After this somewhat mind-numbing section, there are many verses about purity and uncleanliness.  Some of it is really strange to our modern sensibilities:  food laws about what is clean and unclean, purification rituals after childbirth and disease.  Then comes the section from which our text is taken today: the Holiness code.  Included are all sorts of teachings about practical, everyday holiness that sound really strange to us: don’t sacrifice your child to the Cannaite god, Molech, .  And don’t have sex with animals. What is a contemporary Christian, or Jew for that matter, to do with all this?  Why might the compilers of the Christian Common Lectionary include this passage to go along with today’s New Testament piece from Jesus about loving your enemies?  Are these passages just another version of “be good, be nice?”  Or is there a common thread in these passages that points beyond individual piety and morality?  I’m thinking there is, and I’m wondering if it has to do with an invitation to live in some kind of alternative community, being in the world but not quite of the world, as Jesus told his disciples.  Personally, I’m hungry for a word, for a vision that is both provocative and encouraging about how we live together as global community. The world we are living in seems to be such a hodgepodge of hostility and smugness, save-your-own-skin self-protectiveness and cynical hopelessness.  What we can do differently, or better, as communities, as a nation?  How do we do this living together in loving community thing when we are all so divided?   \\n\\tWe make an effort to take scripture seriously in this church, even as we do not take it literally, and yes, even when the passages initially appears off-putting.  Let’s dive into this passage that is purportedly coming from the mouth of the great Jewish leader Moses, who brought the Jewish people out of slavery Egypt and through the wilderness wanderings to the promised land.  Most Jewish scholars will tell you this portion of the law was most likely complied much later, after the return from Exile in Babylon and the re-building of the destroyed Temple – mid 6th century BCE.  It’s to be viewed “in the tradition” of this great leader. “You shall be holy,” Moses quotes God as proclaiming,  “for I the Lord your God am holy.”  Stop right there.  Holy?  We can be easily thrown off by this call to be “holy.”   We may try to avoid this challenge of being a model of holy perfection by simply turning to the words of the easy-going Jesus, but no such luck.  Apparently, Jesus was well-versed in this Leviticus passage, because in today’s passage he is saying pretty much the same thing in his sermon on the mount: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”\\n\\tBe holy.  Be perfect.  Well, that’s impossible.  And who wants to come to church to be shamed about their imperfections and mistakes and fallibilities?  Not me, and I don’t suppose you do either.  Who wants to be considered “holier than thou” anyway? \\n\\tThis holiness of which the Book of Leviticus speaks is not about uptight moral correctness. It’s about us being transformed as people, and community, as we practice imitating the character of God within community. The word “holy” in Hebrew actually means “separate.”  There is always this sense of God’s distinct difference form humans, AND Israel’s call to be separate, to be different, from the other nations.  They were to be a light to the nations, an example of God’s loving and merciful character.  What might this look like?  Levitius gave some direction for people in those times.  Unlike other nations, they were to leave some of their crops unpicked out on the edges of the field, leave some grapes on the vine and fruit on the trees, for the poor and the alien, the stranger, traveling in their midst.  I wonder what that might look like for us today, to leave some of our extra bounty out for others.  Cash you paycheck at the ATM and leave a few 20’s on the ground? Or might we as a nation follow the example of our Canadian friends and really buckle down on welcoming refugees into our midst.   Unlike other communities, the Jews were to pay their workers before they go home at night;  and were told not to give the disabled, the deaf and the blind, a hard time.  Will we stand by and watch protective labor laws be gutted and funding for programs for the disabled end?  \\n\\tThese admonitions in Leviticus are about how a whole society lives justly and in harmony with one another; how they govern themselves, how they care for the marginalized.  What might holiness look like in the public square, where more and more marginalized people are going to be left to struggle on their own?  What role might an inclusive, diverse, open faith community like Falcon Heights Church play in that public holiness?\\n\\t I re-read through my ordination vows recently, as the 38th anniversary of my ordination to the Christian ministry is this week.   I was struck by this particular question that I was asked that day:  Will you be zealous in maintaining both the truth of the gospel and the peace of the church, speaking the truth in love?   I realized what a difficult task this is, to let the truth of the gospel challenge us to action and also somehow keep the peace in a church….especially where everyone has different ideas about what both the “truth of the gospel” and the actions should might be.   I thought of how tempting it is in congregations, especially where there has been conflict over certain social justice issues, to lean more into maintaining a peace but not dealing with the truth of the gospel…mostly by just not talking about difficult Biblical and social issues anymore.  Churches can assume that feeding the poor by collecting food and money for lets us off the hook from exploring the reasons for world hunger, income disparity and homelessness, particularly in this country.  We worry that if we talk about public policies and practices, we will offend someone. In our reticence, we miss the chance to change the tone of the rhetoric in our communities, to build empathy and understanding across differences.   The world looses our voice for justice and compassion for all. \\n\\tBut what about Jesus’ specific directives: turn the other cheek, walk the extra mile, hand over your outer garment?  These seem impractical and naïve, even dangerous in our modern society where terrorists seek to harmus. Be holy, be separate, be different from the rules that run the rest of the world:  And what are the predominant rule in our culture?  Be strong, don’t be vulnerable; you must convince others with your forceful arguments, you must be right; fight back.  Name and be wary of your enemy; put up baracades and exclusionary laws and walls against them.  But Jesus won’t play by these rules.   \\n\\tHe isn’t going to resist the aggressor, “Jesus is going to resist the underlying paradigm of hostility and contempt involved in striking someone’s face with the flat of your hand, of suing someone to the point where you take their cloak (it was prohibited in Jewish law to go that far – everybody needed a cloak), or to force someone to carry your stuff for a mile.   And Jesus says: don’t cooperate “in the underlying paradighm of hate and brutality.” (Feasting n the Word, p. 384)   Sometime during this week, we are each going to be confronted with a choice about this.  It may not be dramatic.  It might be a casual but disparaging comment a friend or family member makes about this group or that group.   How will you, in that moment, calmly but clearly resist the endless cycle of enemy-making that is pervading our country.  Or someone provokes you and you choose not to lash back, but to disengage and refrain from retailiating.  How will you, how will I, do the opposite of what seems normal and reasonable, and in our resistance break the cycle of resentments, fear, hate?\\n\\tWhat Jesus is describing seems counter-intuitive. This is how you are to live, everyday, as part of God’s realm, he says:  Be a separate example of what true loving community looks like.  How often we read Jesus word’s and think he wants us to be wimps.  Far from it.  We are called to be an alternative community, where hopefulness and compassion rule.  Where holiness and perfection is a joy.  Because this is who we are created to be.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.  '"

       "['\\tThe Emmaus Discovery Team was formed this last winter, charged with helping me lead us through this interim period together.  The time between the departure of a former minister and the call of a new minister is a time when a congregation can clarify who it is and what God might have it do next. Earlier this spring, the Team led small groups identifying the challenges and blessings of your 46 years together so far.  Today, the Discovery Team invites us to consider the values that “drive us” here:  “the shared preferences or choices that are consistently prioritized in our behavior together.”  What makes us do what we do?  We are interested not so much in the values we aspire for, but a sense of the core values that shape the way you are together.  Indentifying our values is a way of asking: “What is most important to us, really?”  Not an easy question, as it means taking a hard, honest look at ourselves.\\n\\t\\n\\tDiscussion about values is not held in a vacuum.  It happens within the ongoing tension between the world as it is, that we observe and hear about in the news, and the world as God intends and works towards creating, as we learn about in holy scripture, reflection and prayer.  I lift up a portion of the world as it is this morning, and I realize it is a place of frustration and pain that may not be immediately apparent to most of us.  I spoke with a UCC clergy colleague at the beginning of this week, a few days after the news of the verdict in the Andrew Zimmerman case.  As we discussed our reactions, her voice was trembling but firm over the phone – I could hear a mix of sadness, frustration, exasperation.  “I have an African American son,” she said.   I immediately thought of my own white son, the same age as her young man.  Our Nic has been staying with us the last few weeks before heading to graduate school in California. An avid athlete, Nic has been regularly running through the Vienna neighborhoods at all hours of the day and night.  Due to the color of his skin, my son runs with an unearned priviledge and freedom my friend’s son doesn’t have.  \\n\\t\\n\\tI am not suggesting that we spend time in church debating the merits or mistakes of a Florida jury’s decision.  But I am wondering how we hear and acknowledge the pain and fear that our African American brothers and sisters are expressing in the wake of these judicial proceedings.  As our President unexpectedly described in his press conference on Friday, there is “set of experiences and history that doesn’t go away” for the African American community in relation to Trayvon Martin’s death.  As a white person, with the often unrecognized priviledge that my white skin affords, how do I go about some “soul-searching on the issues of race” as my President suggests?  Put more broadly: How do we have such conversations as a church, in a nation so sharply divided on the values that direct our perspectives and behavior?  \\n\\t\\n\\tThese difficult questions push me to scripture, as I try and understand God’s perspective on such divisions.  The more I thought about it, I realized that Mary and Martha themselves were in a sort of values clash, one that is played out in the choices they make in Jesus’ presence. What is most important in God’s world?  Their close friend Jesus, and probably a group of other folowers, have come for dinner in their home.  Martha welcomes Jesus then focuses on preparing the meal.  Mary quietly sits at Jesus’ feet, in the recognized posture of a disciples, and listens to his teachings. Suddenly, something snaps for Martha and she lashes out at Jesus.  “don’t you care that I’m doing all the work while she works?  Make her get in here and help!”  And she gets chastized for her efforts.  It’s a deceptively simple story that can easily serve as a put down of traditional women’s roles and of the person who always ends up in the kitchen.   \\n\\t\\n\\tWhere do you see yourself in the story?  Hungry to listen quietly and soak in Jesus’ words like Mary?  Eager to extend warm hospitality, like Martha?  Clearly, someone needs to get food on the table so Jesus and his friends can eat. Or do you feel frustrated like Jesus, as you watch someone you love become anxious and distracted by misplaced values that do serve situation at hand?\\n\\t\\n\\tJesus tells Martha that she has become busy with “many tasks.”  I find it interesting that the word “task” in Greek is “diakonein,” which is elsewhere in the New Testament the word used to describe the Christian ministry of serving the traditional role of deacon.   Christian discipleship is all about serving.  But here, the serving has become a problem and it has distracted Martha.  Can there be times our business in the church get us distracted?   She doesn’t confront her sister Mary directly, “oh Mary, I could use a little help here, please!” Instead she “triangles” Jesus into the conflict.  Whatever it was distracting her, her values, her expectations and her anxiousness collide with the reality that only a simple meal is needed.  \\n\\nAnd Jesus’ expression and tone as he replies,   “Martha, Martha?” I imagine frustration, challenge and also compassion.  “You are worried and distracted by many things…few things are necessary, there is need of only one thing.”  Jesus points to a simple meal and a singular focus.  “Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”\\n\\nThe British author EB White once wrote:  “I wake up each morning torn between a desire to save the world and a desire to savor the world. This makes it very hard to plan the day.”  What we value the most guides our choices of action, consciously and unconsciously.  Both saving and savoring are important!  And living out the values of the Kingdom of God calls for a singular focus nurtured by prayer and soaking in the Word.  I wonder how Mary and Martha reached across the divide between themselves, after Jesus left that night.  I hope they talked a bit, did some dishes together.  How do we reach across our yawning conflicting-values divide as a nation?  How might we soul-search together about race as a church?  We start by staying focused on the world that God intends and to which God calls us to help create.  And we enter into conversation, again and again, listening to one another and sharing from our hearts.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tIt’s been difficult to digest the news this week:  from knifings in nearby St. Cloud, shootings and community outrage in Tulsa and Charlotte, to an department store killings near Seattle.  It’s hard to tear my attention away from this progression to even contemplate the increased bombing of the city of Allepo in Syria.  Where is God in all this?  Where am I, where are we as a congregation in yet another string of distressing world events? Is life some kind of on-going battle that we will win or loose, as we worry about and brace ourselves against adversaries, enemies, all around us?  Is the seeming precariousness of life a matter of luck or chance? How much control do we imagine we have over the fragility, the vulnerability of life, in the midst of a week like this?\\nPart of why I keep reading the Bible is that it challenges my ingrained way of thinking about the world.  It shakes me off of my surface perceptions, pushing me to question and move deeper into life’s meaning and purpose.  Yes, the Bible can be confusing, sometimes violent, often obscure and even annoying book.  In our tradition, we endeavor to read it in its historical context, using the best tools of modern scholarship to figure out what the various authors had in mind in their context, and how this might speak to us today..  We say the various writings are “inspired” but are not the literal word of God.  N.T. Wright, the Anglican Biblical scholar, suggests it is a mistake to assume the Bible is full of rules and regulations to be obeyed and creeds to be believed.  Not so, says Wright.   Nor is it a compendium of abstract and timeless truth, or a collection of witnesses to events.  So, what’s left?  Narrative, Wright answers.  Stories of interactons between God and people.  Narrative about God holding people accountable through compassionate judgment, then showing mercy to and remaking the world.  Narrative where the first two acts are written,say Wright: the unfolding emergence of the Jewish tradition and the ministry of Jesus and the early church which grows out and expands that tradition.  We, as the present day followers of Jesus, are the actors in this unfolding story: now told to imagine, create and play-out, the third act of this drama ourselves. \\nThe ancient narratives provides hints about where God is and what our next steps are, in the middle of all our current muddles and mess as humanity.  Where might this passage from the prophet Jeremiah, from the 6th century BCE, take us?  For context, the northern Kingdom of Israel has already fallen to invading brutality of the Assyrians.  The southern Kingdom of Judah, home of Jerusalem and location of the Jeremiah, is still intact but now besieged.  The puppet king Zedikiah has ignored the impending invasion and frantically tries to align with Egypt.  Jewish people, rich and poor, have crowded in desperation to the fortified city walls of Jerusalem; food is running out and the enemy is at the gates.  If you have skills, a craft, or money, you will be lucky to be dragged off to Babylon, otherwise a citywide slaughter awaits you.  The prophet’s role is to continually challenge the ruling king to follow God’s teachings of mercy, justice and compassion to all under their rule.  But Zedekiah has finally jailed Jeremiah in exasperation, unwilling to tolerate the prophet’s incessant railing against Zedikiah’s corrupt governmental practices.  Zedikiah is sick of hearing that there are logical consequences to disobeying God’s insistence on just and merciful governing.\\nNow imprisoned under palace guard, a word from God comes to Jeremiah.  In the chaos, a desperate relative of his needs to unload some property.  Perhaps the relative is hoping to get his family out of Jerusalem and head south to Egypt before the impending doom.  Lo and behold, his cousin Hanamel arrives, pleading, “buy my field at Anathoth; you’re my relative and have first right of refusal here.”  But everyone is trying to leave, the Babylonians of Assyria are at the city gates; this land is basically worthless!  God appears to be directing an unexpected, symbolic act to communicate with the people in crisis.\\nJeremiah carefully proceeds with the seemingly unwise purchase, signs the deed, obtains the witnesses, weights the money on the scale.  With high drama, he has his personal scribe, Barauch, witness everything, and place the sealed deeds of purchase “in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.   In the midst of the chaos, God directs Jeremiah to look forward.  Jeremiah’s act reminds the people that God promises, in the middle of the uncertainty and pending dislocation, that “houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.”  Houses, fields, vineyards…the stuff of fruitful existence.  When everything is disintegrating around them, God plants seeds of future hope that makes life possible, stable and fruitful in their culture.  Against all odds, there is the promise that they will once again dwell in the land of their ancestors.    \\nI’ve been noticing the shortening of days this last week.  Although few trees have started to turn and drop; the early morning and evening darkness casts a gloom.  Autumn often brings me such ambivalence:  it can be visually dramatic and beautiful, but I find myself bracing against the loss of greenness, the imbending bareness and cold of winter.  As I thought about this paradox, I came upon some writings of the educator and author Parker Palmer.  He described how we often focus on the surface appearance of autumn.  We tend to think it is all about letting go, about loss, even about the demise of warmth and fruitfulness.  “Summer’s abundance decays towards winters death.”  But he also described how plants are also quietly doing something that we don’t often notice: the spreading of seeds.  As plants dies off, they drop a wild abundance of seeds that will become the new life in spring.  Palmer cautions that we can often get fixed on the surface appearance of loss and decline among us, and miss the seeds of new life that are being planted. \\n\\tWhere do we see seeds of hope that might give us confidence in the future?  Some expressions of Christianity focus a lot on ones imagined future in heaven.  It is a common misperception that today’s text from the Gospel of Luke, is a cautionary tale about our future in the afterlife. Some have assumed these passages spells out that If we are rich and greedy, and ignore the poor, we will go to some place of punishment.  And if we are poor, we will go to some kind of heaven into the bosom of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham.   I don’t think this was Jesus point in telling this story.  For Jesus our confidence, our hope, in God’s good future lies in strengthening our resolve to participate in the good in this life.  How might we bring hope to someone in need, someone who crosses our paths while we are living? Jesus asks his listeners and he proceeds to tell today’s parable.\\nEveryday the rich man had a chance to be that hope to the poor man reduced to begging at his gate.  But the man with the resources lived in a culture that conditioned him to ignore Lazarus sitting at his front door, because Lazarus would be considered ritually “unclean” with his open skin lesions and his constant contact with ritually “unclean” dogs. So often we talk sadly about “the poor” or the “disadvantaged.”  We generalize about these people, making hopeless sounding assumptions about their motivation or morals.  We generalize about a lot of people, actually:  “those teenagers,” “the elderly,” “those Muslims,” “that bad neighborhood,” “the druggies,” “those management people at work.”  The rich man in the teaching parable never sees Lazarus for who he is.   Focusing on the surface, we often express a futility of helping various groups.  We lose track of the individuals, each with a separate personhood and unique need.  And we lose track of our call to carry the hope of God’s good future to others. \\nI celebrate of the ways our church continues to bring our collective confidence and hope to the table.  The confirmation class discusses the roots of homelessness in our Twin Cities, then encounters individual faces, specific families with kids, as we prepared and served a meal at House of Charity in Minneapolis yesterday.  Jesus taught that don’t develop a sense of compassion for those in need without actually “seeing” them.  The generality of “homelessness” takes on human specifics; seeds of possibilities are planted in the minds of our youth.  Another group in the church explores the implications of white prividledge as we read Jennifer Harvey’s “Dear White Christian Together.”  Parents share experiences of talking with their kids about racial inequity.  Small seeds of deepened understanding scattered through our congregation.  We welcome a panel discussion on community policing this Thursday, imagining a Falcon Heights slowly transforming into a safer, more just and respectful environment for all.  We scatter these seeds of hope in the midst of frustration and grief over the national news. We become a seeds of hope for people who feel valueless and hopeless.   This is us writing and acting in the next “act” of God healing the world.  Thanks be to God.\\nAmen.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOur scripture readings are awash with references to flowing water this morning.  Given that we have been in the “frozen zone” of an icey winter for so long, I find this imagery encouraging.  By early spring, most of us are eager for movement, some flow.…be it the rush of snow melt and unlocked streams,  our bodies finally outdoors breathing in the fresh air, spring rains coaxing out the slow seep of green buds.   Gently moving water is actually our first sensual experience, as we each floated for months in our biological mother’s amniotic fluid...there in the darkness, our own water-filled body suspended yet held firm.  We each come from a similar place, A mysterious primal abode, filled with sounds of another human heartbeat and dim noises from a world beyond that we had yet to discover.   A commonality we share with each person on the planet; something to ponder in the midst of human diversity, differences and conflict. We come from water, our ancestors crawling up out of the sea to dry land.  We grow in water, we are mostly water.  No wonder this elemental substance has become water such a powerful metaphor in religions and cultures around our water-covered world.   \\n\\t\\n\\tNo where is water a more powerful metaphor than in desert cultures, where the presence of water means life and its absence can spell suffering and death.  Both Jews and Samaritans would know this wilderness story of God providing water for the thirsty Israelites in the wilderness.  Both groups shared the same reverence for the first 5 books of the Bible, the Torah.  But unlike the Jews in the 1st century of the common era, the Samaritans did not accept the writings of the Prophets. They believed Mt. Gerizim was the place for worship of God, not the temple mount in Jerusalem.  Jews considered Samaritans to be impure because they married outside their faith and Samaritans considered the Jews to be unworthy participants in the covenant; these were arguments that went back by centuries and they mistrusted and distained each other.  At this point in John’s narrative Jesus has been teaching and healing in Judea in the south.  And for some reason, on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus makes the risky decision to get there by traveling straight north, passing right through Samaria.  \\n\\nWe have this account of a rather unusual conversation between Jesus and a woman he meets while traveling through the Samaritan territory.  It is the longest recorded conversation between Jesus and anyone in all 4 gospels.  That is in itself curious because Jesus is breaking a lot of rules in talking in even being near this woman.  Jews and Samaritans do not mix and mingle like this.  Drinking from a cup offered by an impure Samaritan will make you ritually unclean and you can’t participate in Temple worship in Jerusalem.  Plus, rabbis are not allowed to talk with women in public, as this also will make you ritually unclean.   So, there he sits by this well, tired and hot from traveling.  We see and feel his humanness; he is thirty and has no way to retrieve water form the well.  It’s high noon and Jesus disciples have gone off to try and find some food.  A woman appears with a water jar.  \\n\\nBiblical commentators have speculated endlessly about why this unnamed woman hasn’t drawn her daily water in the cool of the morning or waited for the evening.  Ah, she must be shunned by the other women water-drawers; she is probably sexually immoral.  Unfortunately, this assumption appears to have been the default mode for much of traditional masculine commentary on women in scripture.  Same thing happens to Mary Magdalene but that is another story and another sermon series.  This unnamed woman may be ostracized from her community in some way. Some surmise she is a prostitute, but the text does not say this.  She admits to having a number of husbands, but we don’t really know why this is. As a first century woman, you could also be divorced at the drop of a hat.  Has she been widowed?  We remember that in ancient cultures, if your husband dies you can easily get passed between your husband’s brothers in the effort to produce a male heir.   \\n\\nJesus’ talks with her at length and breaks the rules in his culture.  These were rules that perpetuated the marginalization, the poverty and demeaning of women.  Implications for us in this conversation?  Here is another challenge in following Jesus:  If we attend to this story, we can’t help but wonder: Who is marginalized among us, like the Samaritans among the Jews?  Or more problematically:  What cultural rules of marginalization are you and I being called to break in Jesus name?  Who are we supposed to avoid or ignore, according to our predominate culture?  As a congregation, we may have become an “Open and Affirming” congregation, welcoming of the LGBT community.  Easy perhaps to welcome same gender couples with children who make there way to us; what would it be like for us to actively invite transgendered individuals?  What does it mean for us to offer radical hospitality and compassion to the truly marginalized? For starters, who might we each have a conversation with this week who seems really  different from me?\\n\\nBack to the interaction at the well.  Jesus asks the woman for some water; she asks why he is asking her, a Samaritan, for a drink.  Jesus replies that if she knew who he was, she would be asking for living water.  “Living water” here takes on a double meaning; both fresh, moving water and now something else which isn’t quite clear.  The woman first focuses on the literal physical impossibilitiy of Jesus retrieving water without a bucket, and then this idea of a “water” that quenches all thirst.  I hear the resounding echo of every time someone tells me that they can’t believe in the Bible because of all the seemingly impossible things they can’t take literally.  We read last week of how the Pharisee Nicodemus’ conversation with Jesus:  the Jewish leader focused on the physical impossibility of being born again from your mother’s womb.  Nicodemus and this unnamed woman both get snagged on the assumption that literalism is the only way to understand the spiritual journey.  In both conversations, Jesus is pushing people to “think outside the box.”  Following this Jesus is not just about the correct comprehension or being a nicer or better person, like a car-jax that boosts you up a few notches.  Jesus wanted people to know that following him is going to involve a transformation of our inner selves, our inner spirit.  Something about Jesus, his living presence, can come into us and grows and enlarges.  It will grow our own love and compassion, transforming assumptions, perceptions and self-awareness.  This is not easy to comprehend. Here, Jesus describes himself as both giving and being the living water.  Jesus is claiming that he himself manifests, incarnates, all the blessings in their tradition which relate to water:  miraculous outdoor springs that bust out of rocks and save the people from death; inner springs that are the movement of God in one’s personal depths, an ever-renewed and mysterious upwelling of full life within us.  Who IS this man to say these presumptuous things? \\n\\t\\n\\tIt turns out that you can still go visit the called “Jacob’s well” today, in the land south of Jerusalem.  Water still fills that well, not from a spring but from an actual underground river that has run for centuries deep in the earth.  Jesus sat by this well that drew from a rushing underground river; talk about living water!  God’s power is that accessible to you, Jesus explained to the woman, “I am the living water.”  This is the deep mystery the apostle Paul would later try and describe in one of his letters: “God’s love has been poured into our hearts.”  “God’s love has been poured into our hearts thru the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.”  I find that these Biblical metaphors often elude my powers of deductive reasoning.  I have to almost go “side-ways” into my brain with some tactile experiencing.  And when it comes to water metaphors, one access point may be as close as our indoor plumbing.   Later today, when you turn on your tap at home, let the water flow over your hands for a minute.  Cup your hands and let the water fill and overflow them.  Close your eyes and imagine the Creator of the Universe pouring love and compassion and insight and strength into your heart.   Turn off the water, dry your hands.  Picture again what you just experienced.  Remind yourself of overflowing water filling your hands through the rest of the day.  Say to yourself: “I am one who has love poured into me through the Holy Spirit.”  As one who is truly seen with compassion and loved by God, just the woman at the well was seen, encouraged and accepted by Jesus.\\nHow can I live in this moment, in this situation, as one who so filled?  How is this living water over-flowing out of me to others?  \\n\\t\\n\\t “There is a man here who has told me everything I have ever done!” the woman said breathlessly, after she had run back into town.  “And he did not judge me, but listened to me and told me he is living water!  Could this possibly be the Messiah?”  Amazingly, on her word, in a world where a woman’s witness means nothing, the townspeople came hurrying to meet Jesus.  Samaritans, all, crowding around him, hearing and believing, inviting him stay with them.\\n\\tGod’s living water of abundant life poured into our hearts and overflowing to the point where we just have to talk about it.  As our thirst is quenched, we naturally pour out to others.  May we each watch for those moments this week where our overflowing hearts can share this spiritual, living water.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEDICTION\\n\\nGo into this week\\n\\nwith your lives overflowing with the love of God,\\n\\nyour hearts saturated with the peace of Jesus Christ,\\n\\nyour whole being\\xa0 filled with the power of the Holy \\n\\nSpirit.  Amen.\\n ',\n",
       " '\\tIn these cold depths of dark winter, the season of Epiphany continues to unfold.  Spring and Easter are far off in the future.  From the icy weather to the unsettling news of violence and suffering throughout our world…. sometimes in January it seems that darkness is overcoming our sources of illumination, energy, healing and empowerment.  In a curious syncronicity, symbolic language about darkness and light weaves through our Common Lectionary scripture texts this morning, passages that are being read in Christian churches around the world today.  From the prophet Isaiah writing in the tumultuous mid-8th century BCE, ancient Israel is promised they will move from their time of darkness, oppression and distress under the Assyrian occupation.  God promises that there will be a day when the world will be shaped by the light of righteousness and justice and peace.  Centuries later, the Gospel writer Matthew sees these promises fulfilled as Jesus who bursts upon the scene.  Quoting Isaiah, Matthew reminds his own late first century community that all across the region, Jews and Gentiles who have “sat in darkness have seen a great light.”  The apostle Paul pleads with his contentious, arguing congregation at Corinth to “be united in the same mind and the same purpose.”  We are drawn deeper into this exploration of the “epiphany” or “manisfestation” of Jesus as a “light” to the world.  How might this image of “light in the darkness” bring us together in ministry as a church?  \\n\\n\\t“In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.”  This ancient Jewish poetry comes down to us in the Book of Genesis, oral tradition finally recorded in writing long before either Isaiah or Jesus’ time.  Similar to Creation stories from various traditions around the world, this tale also begins with images of a great darkness, an embryonic shadow place devoid of light.  “Then God said, let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.”  Over the centuries, new storytellers come to describe emerging pictures of Creation, ones “swimming in stories about fireballs and photons and light.”  Matthew Fox, theologian and author, has been part of a world wide movement that invites these diverse understandings, different languages of the nature and purpose of Creation, into fruitful dialogue.  Since the early 1980’s, this Catholic priest pushed out on the edges of Christian theology, drawing interfaith groups of religious leaders, spiritual teachers and scientists together to explore these different ways of describing our world and its purpose.  Fox’s description of a Creation-Centered Spirituality, was based on the notion that Biblical creation stories are about an “original blessing” and not, as some early Christian church fathers had decided, about “original curse of original sin.”  Silenced from the Vatican and then defrocked from the priesthood finally in 1993, this visionary activist has gone on to inspire both environmental activism as well as the spiritual lives of many progressive Christians. It is in conversation with several physicists, that Fox invites us to consider both the metaphoric and scientific significance of light.  Hear his description of creation from his book One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths:  \\n\\tFifteen billion years ago, in a great flash, the universe flared forth into being.  In each drop of existence a primordial energy blazed with an intensity never to be equaled again…In the beginning the universe is a great shining that expands rapidly and then explodes into hundreds of billions of dark clouds…\\nLater, a hundred billion galaxies light up with a splendor new to the universe.  The beginning of the universe is a smooth, intense flame.  A few billion years later the large-scale structure of the universe glows in great sheets of galaxies and in their intersections in long, spidery filaments of sparkling worlds.  \\n\\t“You are to be a light to the nations,” God will tell our Biblical ancestors.\\n“I am the light of the world….and you are the light of the world,” Jesus will go on to teach.   Scientists show us that all matter is actually slow-moving light; we exist at all because of the light.  Matthew Fox describes how “light drives all energy systems.  Plants and we eat light, breathe light, drink light and transform light into energy.”  During the middle ages, Jewish mystics writing in the Kabbalah, will describe that the creation of human beings is “attributed to sparks gathering….some sparks of light adhering and some remaining hidden throughout the world, sparks of holiness (suffusing) and intermingling with everything in the world.”  Is it no wonder that Albert Einstein admitted in the early part of the last century that “all I want to do is study light.”\\n\\tAs I consider the light metaphors for the divine and for illumined understanding throughout the world religions, I am struck by this paradox of our human existence:  Erik Erikson, the 20th century developmental psychologist describes it well as he wrote how religion manages to “elaborate on what feels profoundly true even though it is not demonstrable; (religion) translates into significant words, images and codes the exceeding darkness whichgt surrounds human existence, and the light which pervades it beyond all comprehension.” (quoted p. 11, John Shea, Stories of God).   In choosing to follow the Jesus way, among all the religious choices in the world, we are somehow “called to both share the light that we can see and feel; and we are also to share the light that we can only imagine.”  Stephanie Paulsell, professor at Harvard Divinity School writes this as she describes how Isaiah pushes the people of Israel outward, “outward to the coastlands, outward to the ends of the great, wide world…promising that following the light will lead them ever more deeply into the life of the world…to those who have been waiting for God’s light to break in upon their darkness.”  (Feasting on the Word, p. 270, Year A, Volume I.) \\n\\tSo Jesus approaches some fishermen by the Sea of Galilee, people he probably knew well living in the town of Capernaum, and on that particular day issues an invitation:  “Follow me and I will make you fish for people.”  Not, believe this or that, and you will get into heaven.  But follow me, and I will show you how to connect with people and share this light of God’s good news.  The Kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God’s righteousness, mercy and peace, is drawing near.\\t\\n\\tThe more I think about where you are as a congregation in this transition time, in this time between decline and renewal, I realized that the invitation offered by Jesus has got to be the starting point for the change you seek.  The starting point is not new programs, it’s not being an open and affirming congregation, it’s not refurbished rooms, it’s not even new mission projects, it’s not some surprise donor giving a huge gift, it’s not even hiring a wonderful new minister.  All these, of course, matter….but they are not where you start if you want to renew the ministries of a congregation.  The starting point is within you.  It’s within each of us, as we seek to be light to the world.   The starting point for the renewal of the ministries of this church is in each of you as you seek to follow the Word of God as outlined in the scriptures, and as you seek to follow the Living Word of God in the person of Jesus.   At the start, it’s not about church growth, it’s about the deepening of your relationship with the light.   It’s the unity of mind and purpose that comes from seeking to explore and be this light. \\nJesus invites people to experience the light of God’s transformative love and to share it with others. \\n\\tIn everything we do in the life of our congregation, we have to ask ourselves this question:  will others see the light of God’s love and compassion in us?  In this way, will they see Jesus?  Will we see Jesus in the way we interact with each other, not just as we cheerfully pass the peace in worship, but in the way we don’t ignore people at coffee hour, the way we smile encouragingly at the young parent with the squirmy child?  Will people see the light of Jesus in our deliberations in the Church Council and Annual meeting, in our conversing the newcomer at coffee hour, in our Bible study or discussion groups, in the ways we generously share our financial resources, in the way we shine a light on places of darkness and suffering in the community and world around us?  Will there be honest and respectful dialogue among us, as we seek to both honor our diversity of perspectives yet still be “united in the same mind and same purpose?”   The medieveal Jewish mystics spoke of “raising the sparks of the potent energy of the divine ideal.”  I’ll be interested to see what gets “sparked” around here, in the months and years ahead!\\n\\tJesus issued both invitation and promise by the Sea of Galilee, as he began his ministry and as he does with us now.  He invites us to follow him into the unknown places of our lives, illumined by the light of his teachings and continued presence.  And he promises that we will be changed, “sparked;” we will be transformed.  We will be able to draw in others to know his power and love. “Follow me,” says Jesus.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tFor the last four Sundays we have been looking closely The Lord’s Prayer.   It is a simple prayer that Jesus taught his disciples to use.  It’s a way to talk with God and a way to understand what God is like.  The prayer helps us understand our propose for being here on earth, and how we are to live together.  “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil,” the final request of the prayer, is our focus today.  However it is translated, it includes words that describe some of the more troubling aspects of our human condition:  temptation, trial, evil.   For me, it raises difficult questions and persistent questions about why and how we suffer and whose responsibility is it to corral and subdue evil in the world.  Is it God’s job to get rid of evil?  If we are God’s partners in healing God’s worldwide Household, what of this is our job?\\t\\n\\t“Lead us not into temptation, the time of trial, deliver us from evil.” When I was a child, my younger sister and I had a small picture book about the Lord’s Prayer.  The book was filled with lovely water-color paintings meant to catch a child’s attention; the illustration I remember most clearly went with this passage we are considering today.  Picture in your mind’s eye an outdoor scene with trees and grass, and a small group of children starting to climb over a split-rail fence.  On the other side of the fence is an apple tree; its leafy branches are heavy with ripe red fruit.  Ah…forbidden fruit!   An angel-type figure is standing next to the children with its arms raised.  I could never quite figure this one out: was the angel trying to stop the kids from the illegal deed of apple-stealing?  Was the angel enticing them to pick the apples and God was supposed to stop them?   All I remember is some vague notion about God helping me not to be naughty.\\n\\tA child’s perspective.  And I’m afraid it models an unfortunate adult approach to moral behavior and God’s power in our lives.  Please God, help me be a good person!   We often assume temptation or trial is just about individual morality.  So we pray, “God, help me not eat that extra piece of pie; God, help me not have an affair while my spouse is out of town; God, help me not cheat on my income taxes; God help me stay off those internet web sites that are full of all kinds of virtual temptation.”  Sometimes the purpose of Christianity gets reduced to “Preventing Individual Naughtiness.”  And God becomes “The Great Dispenser of Discipline.”   We start to assume we get punished if we are naughty and rewarded if we are nice.  \\n\\tNaughty, nice.  Right, wrong.  Punishment, reward.   Pretty simple; childlike, in a way.  The problem is, we can loose a more mature perspective on our ability to sin, both an individuals and as larger systems, institutions and nations.  This naughty/nice, punishment/reward, perspective makes Jesus’ message easy to reject, or simply ignore, when we are no longer children.  Particularly when we become teenagers. Teenagers, if they are developing naturally, often feel a tad defiant towards most types of authority (parents, school, police, church).   Adolescence is a time when many of us start questioning ideas and answers; we take all kinds of risks (publically or privately), trying to see what we are made of; we suddenly want to explore for ourselves just what is right and wrong.  We don’t want to just accept our parents’ beliefs as our own; we want to experience God and morality for ourselves. Unfortunately, some people stay stuck in this adolescent view through much of their lives:  “I don’t need anyone to tell me what to do! I’m in control of my own life!  I can take care of myself; I’m not dependent on anyone!”   And even if we do hold onto this view of God as the Great Enforcer of Proper Behavior into adulthood, we end up resenting it at some level.  If our good behavior isn’t rewarded, we may feel unjustly treated in some way.  “Hey, I behaved myself and didn’t get my reward of good health and prosperity!”  “My mother is a good person, why should she get sick?”  “My friend is so loving and ethical, why did he loose his job?”    \\n\\tEither way, we can end up missing the point of Jesus’ message: We are created to be coworkers with God in healing the world Household of God, to take responsibility for our own behavior and not expect rewards and punishments. \\n\\tLet’s see if we can get closer to Jesus’ original meaning here in this part of the prayer:  the Greek word in the Lord’s Prayer that is translated as temptation can also mean trial or test.  And there is probably no better place to understand what Jesus was talking about here, than to look at the time when Jesus himself was sorely tempted, put to the test:  What we call the “temptations in the wilderness,” when Jesus retreated for a time of prayer and fasting right after his baptism in the Jordan River by John.  There the tempter, the Devil, Satan (this is translated differently in the different gospels) puts it to him:  “Hey, you must be hungry: doesn’t God provide manna for all?  Satisfy your own hunger: Turn these stones into bread.  No? Well, how about something alittle more public, come up to the top of the top pinnacle tower of the Jerusalem Temple and jump and let’s give the folks a display of miraculous power!  No?  Okay (continues the tempter) How about dominion over all the world powers?  You keep saying the Kingdom of God is at hand!  Let’s bring it on, Jesus!  Let’s smash these human powers and bring God’s reign in by force!”  Jesus refuses; the tempter departs.\\nRemember Jesus’ historical context:  Jesus has grown up in Nazareth after a huge military incursion of Roman legions in 4 BC, which brutally squashed violent rebellions among the Jewish people.   Roman power continues to oppress the people, demanding excessive taxes, military service, and most repugnant, worshipping Caesar as God.  How very very tempting to think that more violence might be the answer.   Perhaps this is the toughest challenge in this prayer and in Jesus’ teachings: again and again Jesus will refuse violence as the way to bring in the Kingdom, the Reign, of God.\\n\\tThere are Biblical scholars who say that humans’ original sin was not eating fruit from a tree in the Garden of Eden.  They point out that the first time the word “sin” is used in Hebrew scriptures of the Old Testament, the oldest parts of the Bible, it refers the Cain and Abel story.  We remember that these were the two sons in the Adam and Eve story and they were strong rivals.  Cain ends up killing his brother.  In response, God warns, for the first time, of “sin lurking at their door.”  What was the sin?  Escalating violence that seeks not just to defend but to retaliate.  Excalatory violence was starting to look pretty tempting to many of those under Roman imperial oppression in the first century during Jesus time and Jesus knew it was a dead end.   \\n\\tI think of difficult times I have been through in my life, times when I had the choice between depending upon my own limited understanding and human strength, flailing around…. or working with God to figure out what God was calling me to next in the middle of the mess!  Think of one of your own times of trial and testing in your family or this church’s history.  Have we been reactive and destructive as we struggled to cope?  How tempting to resort to fear, bitterness, defensiveness, even violence in such trying times.  \\n\\tThe curious thing about times of crisis, trial and testing is that while they can break people, they can also change people for the better.  Do I reply on my own insight and strength, or do I reach out to God and to others!  We can acknowledge our part in the mess; we can confess our sins, repent and change our ways.  Our character can be tempered and shaped; our inner resolve can grow.   \\n\\tTimes of trial, temptation and test present us with a moment of choice.   For some reason, God has placed us in a world that is both beautiful and dangerous, filled with wonder and resources and unpredictability.   We are free to work with God, to resist evil, to help heal the world and enjoy it together.  Jesus knew that the world will respond to our co-working with God together. And so Jesus urges us, his followers, to pray, “lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\"Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory [is] above the earth and heaven.\"\\xa0\\nIn the Old Testament times, a name was not only identification, but an identity as well. Many times a special meaning was attached to the name. Names had, among other purposes, an explanatory purpose (e.g., Nabal, whose name means \"fool,\" is the target of Abigail\\'s explanation to David: \"For as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:\" -\\xa0). Throughout Scripture God reveals Himself to us through His names. When we study these names that He reveals to us in the Bible, we will better understand who God really is. The meanings behind God\\'s names reveal the central personality and nature of the One who bears them.\\nWho is God to you?\\nIs He your Most High God, All sufficient One, Master, Lord of Peace, the Lord Who Will Provide? Is He your Father? We must be careful not to make God into an \"it\" or a \"thing\" to which we pray. He is our Jehovah Raah, the Lord our Shepherd. God knows us by our name, shouldn\\'t we know Him by His?\\nHallowed be Your name?\\nTo hallow a thing is to make it holy or to set it apart to be exalted as being worthy of absolute devotion. To hallow the name of God is to regard Him with complete devotion and loving admiration. God\\'s name is of the utmost importance (); therefore we ought reserve it a position of grave significance in our minds and hearts. We should never take His name lightly (;\\xa0), but always rejoice in it and think deeply upon its true meaning.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Lord’s Prayer.  You may have said this prayer a thousand times over your lifetime, or it may be entirely new to you.  Those who grow up in the church probably learn it as children, and it sure can seem pretty rote as we just rattle it off each Sunday.  You say it at a rapid clip and finish it in less than 20 sections…15 if you use the words “debt” instead of “tres-pass-es.” But the Lord’s Prayer is still the most common prayer said in Christian worship around the world; we call it “The Lord’s” because “Lord” is one of the many different titles Christians give to Jesus.  Jesus created this prayer at the request of his disciples, drawing on the cosmology and mysticism of his first century Judaism.  It’s probably the best summary we have of his own values, beliefs and unique perspective on the life well-lived.  During the next few weeks I will offer some different lens through which we might see this “inherited treasure” that has come down to us through the centuries (Prayers of the Cosmos).  I urge us to soak in these words through our weekdays and notice: how do these words help us hear God’s still-speaking voice?  \\n\\t\\n\\tAccording to the New Testament Gospel accounts,  Jesus replied to his disciples request by saying: “When you pray, say:  Father, hallowed be Your name.”  This is probably closest to the original words of Jesus, although the version from Matthew’s gospel, sounds more familiar to us.  It is a bit expanded and was used by the early church in their worship life together.  “Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” which is our focus this morning.  Father?  Heaven?  Hallowed?  This certainly isn’t Elizabethan England here in Vienna; what’s with the “thy” language?     \\n\\t\\n\\tOne of the problems in understanding Jesus’ original intent is that Jesus and his followers spoke Aramaic, the native Middle Eastern language of ordinary people at the time.  After Jesus was killed, his sayings and stories about him circulated in oral form in Aramaic.  They were eventually recorded in Greek, then much later in English and other contemporary languages around the world.   And as usual, much can get lost in translation.  Neil Douglas-Klotz in his book Prayers of the Cosmos, claims that we have lost considerable “heart consciousness and prophetic juice” of the original Aramaic tongue.  He points to other familiar teachings of Jesus such as “be you perfect” – frankly, words that tend to set my teeth on edge.  This scholar’s translation from the Aramaic suggests that Jesus was saying not “be perfect” but “be you all-embracing.”  Not “blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth” but “soften what’s rigid inside and you shall receive physical vigor and strength from the universe.”   Of particular interest to me, as we dive into the Lord’s Prayer, is that the Aramaic word for “heaven” actually means, “the universe.”   What looks like a geographical spot separate from us and our planet, “our Father who art in heaven” is actually a place all around and within us.  The Aramaic word for “our Father,” is abba.  It’s roots mean “rises and shines, vibrates, in space.”  This shining, vibratingness, the Oneness of God, was not something far away but understood to include every center of every activity and place we see, and that has the potential for being.    \\n\\t\\n\\tIn the beginning of the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus addresses God as “Father.”  This traditional, patriarchal language is a real problem for some of us and for others of us it is comforting and well-loved title for God.  There are many passages in the Hebrew scriptures that describe God’s loving, parent-like care of God’s people, using tender and intimate words, such as “Father of orphans and protector of widows” from the Psalms.  Think for a moment of how Jesus could have started this prayer: “Our high and mighty one” or “Our Judge,” or “Our warrior king,” titles also used in the Hebrew scriptures. But Jesus uses the word Abba to address God: in Aramaic, their spoken tongue meant Daddy or Papa.  What I have learned from reading John Dominic Crossans book The Greatest Prayer: Rediscovering the Revolutionary Message of the Lord’s Prayer, is that In this male dominated society, the word “father” was often a shorthand for “parents”, father and mother.  So the word abba was not only intimate language, but also it also referred to the householders in charge of land and an extended multigenerational collective of family members, servants, hired hands, and workers.  \\n\\t\\n\\tTo understand Jesus’ perspective, says Crossan, picture God as the Householder of the World house.  God as the Householder of Earth, who runs the planet like a well-run estate.  And God apparently values a well-run household where humans are good stewards of the World house, care for it and use its resources justly and wisely.   Ouch.  I share these values but I am painfully aware that my own carbon foot-print is too big.  I just flew round-trip to Long Beach on a gas guzzling jet!  But I was so proud to be present at our denomination’s 29th General Synod, with over 3000 people from United Church of Christ congregations across the country gathered to discuss Christian’s role as earth stewards.   Every two years, General Synod gathers resolutions about current social and justice issues, studies and votes on them.  Not to speak for the local churches, but in prophetic witness to the local churches of the UCC.  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe night before I traveled to General Synod, our Emmaus Church Council has some preliminary discussions about the future “greening” of our church building.  We are exploring the possibility of installing solar panels on the Emmaus roof.  When I got to Synod, one of the resolutions debated and passed was \"On Moving UCC Church Buildings Toward Carbon Neutral.\" \\xa0I felt proud of Emmaus and glad to be part of a denomination that takes our Father/Mother/Householder God’s call to earth stewardship seriously!  Even more critical was the resolution passed \"Urging Divestment from Fossil Fuel Companies.\" \\xa0Within five years, our national UCC organization is required to divest all assets in these companies.  While our national church cannot require or force local UCC conferences, associations or churches to take certain actions, it is urging all the rest of us to do the same.  Those of us clergy at General Synod were well aware this could mean a hit to our pension funds. Yet the call to being a bold, prophetic witness in times like this was too strong to ignore.  The UCC is now the first mainline denomination in the United States to take such a stand.   Word of these resolutions traveled quickly that afternoon, and soon our UCC President and Presiding Minister, The Rev. Geoffrey Black, was receiving a personal phone call of congratulations and thanks from South African Bishop Desmond Tutu.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWe are heirs, children of this Householder God.  This God intends that everyone in the Household has enough, and takes special care of the vulnerable ones.  Our planet is now one of the vulnerable ones.  But you and I are infused with this God; we swim in this vibration of God’s creative power.  We are called to act and we have the power to do so.\\n\\t\\n\\tAs this Independence Day weekend draws to a close, the fireworks are over and the picnics consumed, I give thanks for our nation, for the beautiful country of lakes and hills, plains and rivers and mountains, in which we are blessed to live.  I give thanks that our nation is part of this precious Earth, and that we are called to be good stewards along with our Household God.  I give thanks that we are part of a courageous, wider church that is taking seriously its call to be caretakers and healers of this precious planet.\\n\\t\\n\\tSoak in these first phrases of the prayer this week.  “Our Father/Mother, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.”  See what unfolds for you as you savor these words.  May we be led deeper into the presence and purposes of our Householder God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe New Testament part of our Bible contains such a mix of teachings, stories and letters that it can get confusing where we are when, on any given Sunday morning.  Written at various points during the first century CE, our present day New Testament has been re-translated and the collection has been re-shaped up to the 21st century.  It gives us a sometimes perplexing view into a world very different from our own; a world where the realm of things unseen is taken for granted; a world where people like Paul and his companion missionaries expectedly traveled all over the place; a world where the overarching control of the Roman empire is simply hard for us to imagine.  It takes focus and openness and diligence to get into the texts and to root around.  What is here for us today, as we move through challenging transitions of our own lives and the changes in our congregation?\\n\\tThis section from the Gospel of John is a goodbye message in which we find a strange combination of sadness and hopefulness. The setting is a private room in Jerusalem where Jesus’ shares his last supper with his closest friends and students.  John describes Jesus as trying to explain to his followers that he has to depart.  They will no longer have him in their lives.  They will have to go on with their outreach ministry without him…and yet, and yet, they will not be alone.  If Jesus sounds a bit ambiguous here, well…he is talking about something that is actually quite ambiguous.  Jesus gone, dead, not here; Jesus here in a different way….? \\n“Are you going to be here with us or not, Jesus?”  we might well have inquired, if we had been sitting at that table. Jesus goes on to describe how God will send a comforter, an advocate, the Holy Spirit that will fill them and guide them.  He gives his listeners this tender image of he and God coming to them and making “our home with them.”  Such curious symbolic language – Jesus and God setting up homemaking in their followers.\\nThe church has preserved these ancient words, down through the centuries.  It is mysterious language, language which I believe is symbolic of an unseen reality that permeates our lives as followers of Jesus.   God and the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, taking up residence in us as we “keep” Jesus’ words.  You and I are the home, homes, essentially, of the Creator of the Universe. Ponder that as you walk around this week.  I am the home of the Creator of the Universe.  And that person is also the home of the Creator of the Univese!  I don’t take this to mean we are God’s only home; what is suggested here is simply that God and the Risen Jesus Christ take up residence in us.  How are we to make sense of this?   \\nTo explain what this is like, Jesus uses the mysterious metaphor of “the Advocate,” the companionship of the Holy Spirit.  “God will send the Holy Spirit in my name,” explains Jesus, “and the Spirit will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.”  Here’s the question for each of us: How hospitable am I to divine guidance making a home in me?  Am I open to direction beyond my own good thinking, when Plan A doesn’t make sense anymore and even Plan B falters?  \\n\\tIn this story from Acts we find one of Jesus’ closest followers, Peter, the one who denied knowing Jesus when pressed by Roman guards.  Transformed to his core through his experiences with the Risen Jesus, Peter now travels the region to share the Good News that such change of heart and mind is possible.  In today’s story, Peter and his fellow travelers hopscotch up the western coast of the Aegan sea and end up to Philippi, leading city of then Macedonia, current day Greece.  They hang out for a few days; nothing much seems to happen.  On the Sabbath day of rest and worship, they hear of others who gather down at the nearby river for prayer.  Is it a synagogue or just an outdoor worship spot?  Anyone else besides this group of women there?  Not sure.  But what emerges is this curious detail about another sojourner not unlike themselves:  A traveling tradeswoman named Lydia, a dealer in rare and precious purple cloth, originally from the city of Thyatira (back over on the other side of the Aegaen Sea, in Asia Minor).   Notice how she is named, which is rare for women in the hugely patriarchal Biblical tradition.  Feminist scholarship in the last few decades has revealed that women like Lydia were quite prominent in the early church, and were more instrumental than history has led us to believe, as both missionaries and preachers of the Gospel.  \\n\\tIn this text, Lydia is described as a “God fearer” which means she was probably an educated, Hellenized Greek, a sophisticated urban person, who found the ethical teachings and monotheism of Judaism to be compelling.  It was not uncommon for women of means to hold gatherings of prevailing religious movements in their homes, be they the cult of Dionysus or the early Christian house meetings.  We learn here that God opens her heart as she listens to Paul talk about Jesus, and his way of compassion and justice for all.  She is profoundly moved.  She owns a large home in the city, as indicated by her whole “household” (relatives, servants, etc) being baptized along with her.  And here’s where I think the author of Acts wants us to pay attention, because this “foreigner,” outsider to the faith, enacts an essential principal of the Jewish Torah and of Jesus’ ministry:  hospitality to the stranger.  She implores Paul and his company to come stay at her home.  God makes a home in her, and she responds with radical hospitality.  She opens her home, her resources, her heart to strangers.   She is an outsider to the Jewish faith, but seems to understand intuitively a central aspect of Jewish spiritual practice: hospitality to “the stranger who sojourns with you in your land” as described in, the Book of Jewish Law in our Old Testament book of Leviticus.  \\n\\tI believe true hospitality is a central challenge to the contemporary church.  I’m not talking just tea, cookies and bars here.  The essential hospitality question that should be addressed in the any interim period is: who is our neighbor now?  Are we paying attention to our current neighbors in the way Jesus defined neighbor: the person we don’t expect to connect with, the outsider, the stranger, in our midst or just outside our doors?  Who are the sojourners in our midst, that God desires us to draw into a deeper experience of God’s hospitality, God’s grace, God’s extravagant welcome?  What kind of inner openness and compassion do we need to nourish in ourselves so we can extend this hospitality?  I find that I need to run under more than my own steam to do this.\\t \\nHenry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest and theologian, writes in his slim and haunting book, The Way of the Heart, about this active presence of God finding a home in us.  He speaks about how we can “slowly build a little nest” of prayer and openness for God inside of us.  It’s as though the words of simple prayer, even \\nslowly repeated short phrase such as “God, I wondering about you,” or “Spirit, are you there?” or “Open my heart,” build a nest.   Help! Thanks! Wow! as Anne Lamott would say it more bluntly (“Help Thanks Wow: The Three Essential Prayers). These daily, simple prayers “slowly build a little nest for themselves in our heart and stay there for the rest of our busy day.  Even while we are talking, studying, commuting, gardening, or building,” even sleeping, writes Nouwen, “the prayer can continue in our heart and keep us aware of God’s ever-present guidance” (p. 82, The Way of the Heart).\\nMaybe this is the part that is our job:  slowly building this nest inside, stick by twig, fiber by feather, prayer by prayer.  Maybe this is the essential job of the church: to help us individually and communally build a nest to receive the living presence of God.  Not so we can just sit cozy and chummy with God and our favorite friends, happy in our own little nest.  We build and learn to dwell in the nest so openness and compassion can grow in us. And that will compel us to reach out to our hurting world is new, courageous new ways.  Welcoming God’s indwelling within our hearts may be the key to opening our spaces, our resources to the strangers among us.   Down by the river, outside the ancient city of Phillipi, Lydia welcomed God’s spirit into her heart and gospel-preaching strangers into her home.  God deeply longs to settle in the nest of our hearts and create the new within us.  That is Good News.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.      \\t\\n(We join together in a time of silent reflection…..)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThese parents’ concerns resonated with me, and reflect a growing practice within the wider United Church of Christ: helping our youth explore the difference between confirming and conforming (see “Confirm Not Reform” curriculum from Logos Productions).  Part of developing one’s own sense of personal identity is to take a hard look at ways we have been urged/forced to conform. How might young people identify and deconstruct some of these beliefs?  As a middle-school student, I myself proclaimed that I was an “atheist.”  But I don’t remember anyone actually asking me:  “Anne, what idea or image of God do you not believe in?  What might be some other ways to think about God and why you are here on earth?  And what difference might this make in the way you see the world, make moral choices?”  At the time, no one asked me these questions.\\n\\n\\tFor several centuries now, the practice of Confirmation in the Protestant Church has been about a young person’s education in the proper doctrine or beliefs of the church, so the youth could adequately understand and “confirm” the faith professed by his or her parents at baptism.  During infant baptism, we ask the parents if they themselves believe and trust in God, in Jesus and the Holy Spirit, and if they will raise the child within the nurture of the Christian church.  Confirmation Class was the time to learn about and then publically testify to these beliefs. Little attention was paid to the fact that developmentally, young people need to learn to reflect critically on beliefs, faith and values given to them by parents, church and society. \\n\\n\\tAll of this is rather curious, when I look at the Biblical record of how Jesus of Nazareth actually interacted with people. He never seemed big on doctrine or beliefs.  He had this knack for going up to people and saying “follow me” and they would.  He certainly didn’t check out their “faith status” first.  But in his\\nconversations with his closest followers, those called his disciples, he speaks specifically about their faith.  What did he mean by this word, “faith?”\\n\\n From our brief Luke passage today, we hear Jesus disciples make what sounds like a reasonable request:  “Lord, can you increase our faith?!” Jesus has just been talking privately with them about the extraordinary demands of following him.  In conversation right before this, Jesus insists they were to continually forgive one another: be mutually accountable, lovingly rebuke where necessary, apologize and make amends.  “Do this seven times a day, if you have to.”  Apparently, living fully in God’s Kingdom was more complicated than they had imagined.  “If someone repents, you must forgive,” Jesus pushes them. To which they understandably respond: “good grief, we are going to need more of something to do this.  Jesus, can you give us more faith!” \\n \\nJesus responds in an odd manner:  “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.”  There is something in the sharpness of Jesus’ answer, the bizarre exaggeration of his images about small seeds and huge deeply rooted bushes, that leaves me wondering if the disciples, and maybe I, have missed the point somewhere.  Is this about more faith? Is quantity the issue here?  Or might Jesus be using common images in a cryptic and indirect manner so he can unsettle our assumptions about faith? The disciples appear to assume that faith does come in different quantities: if I have the right amount, I can face the challenges of following you, Jesus.  I can valiantly change the world!    \\n\\n\\tSo what is “faith” here?  Are we talking about faith like a super-power, so I can then somehow manipulate an even bigger super power? I wonder if Jesus turns to irrelevant references like tiny mustard seeds and huge mulberry bushes and tossing foliage into the sea because….the disciples are asking an irrelevant question.  It may not be about an amount of faith.  I sense that Jesus may have been telling them they had all the faith they needed. \\n\\t \\n\\tMaybe the disciples question should have been, “Jesus, we need some help here understanding how following you works, about how to be and act faithful.  Jesus, we need some help in learning how to trust God, to trust in God’s steady presence and unfolding plan even when things look bad.”  They may already have this thing they think they need.  A connection with this transforming God, which they need to learn to trust.  This may be at the core of what gets us confused:  we hear the word “faith” and think it is about “belief” – an idea or concept we have to get our brain to accept.  Yet the word faith in Biblical times carried deeper connotations of trust, as in “to have confidence in.”  The disciples may have lost track of what they already had.  I hear this echoed in the Apostle Paul’s letter, written years later, as he reaches out from his prison cell to a young co-worker Timothy:   “You do not have a spirit of cowardice or fear,” he writes in this mentoring letter 2 Timothy. You have “a source of power and love and self-discipline.”  You have it.  Lean into it, engage it, Paul urges his leader-in-training. Guard this “good treasure entrusted to you….this treasure of faith that comes down from your mother and your grandmother and lives in you,” he counsels Timothy.  Paul speaks of a legacy of trusting, of acting with confidence in God’s presence and strength.  How might we have faith to do the hard stuff in life?\\n\\n\\tPerhaps when a congregation’s such as ours is faced with overwhelming challenges like addressing racial inequities, we might question: “How do we have the faith to do this? Wow do we ‘guard the good treasure entrusted’ in us from generations past here at Falcon Heights Church UCC and throughout our denomination?  How do we stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us?”  Because clearly, one of the on-going legacies of this church has been an abiding concern for those who live in poverty and for racial inequity; a deep passion for those who don’t have enough proper food, school, jobs or heath care.  This kind of caring and outreach have been part of Falcon Heights Church’s identity since it’s formation in the late 1940’s.  This is about a level of faithfulness, of trust that we are called by God to do these things and that our actions make a difference.  We allow the inherent fruitfulness of God’s creative justice and power to affect how we perceive and respond to life. \\n\\n\\tIn these days of increased racial tension and deeper awareness about some of the problems in how we keep our communities safe, we are challenged to have trust in God’s creative justice and power to make changes in our community.  I saw that kind of faith-trust in action as we hosted the panel discussion on new directions for Community Policing here in this packed Sanctuary this last Thursday.  Members of our Executive Board served as greeters, welcoming the diverse group of attendees. A number you listened, learned and stayed around to talk with different people in the over-flow crowd.   Tough questions were asked, and were respectfully responded to by the panel, which included the President of the St. Paul NAACP chapter, and a retired St. Paul police sergeant.  Important data about racial inequities in policing was shared by one of our former members of the Minnesota House of Representatives and the local legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.  We were urged to continue to ask questions about police training and policing policies and to trust that our concerns would be addressed.   We were reminded to support our police in the tremendously hard job that they do on our behalf.  We were challenged to step out in greater trust, in greater faith; trusting in one another and our ability to work for changes in our community and to heal these injustices.  \\n\\tJesus seemed to think the disciples’ problem wasn’t about an amount of faith; it was about the ways they were with one another, and with God.  He was concerned about their level of trust and patience, honesty and forgiveness.  Each Sunday we worship together we renew our commitment to faithful action beyond our walls. We do this as by nurturing these relationships among us.  We are here, “rekindling our faith,” our ability to trust in God’s good future together. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\\n`\\tBut Jesus is already off in another direction.  He makes this brief reference to the ancient Jewish apocalyptic writings in the Book of Daniel about the end times.  These are stories probably originate during the exile of the Jews in Babylon, but were recorded later about 160 BCE.  The writings speak of a future time when God will send someone who is “like a son of a human one” to come and help get rid of all the beast-like nations who are ravaging the people of Israel.  But in self-referencing as “the Son of Man, of the human one,” Jesus does lay out a plan for how God is going to over-throw the current repressive Roman regime.  Instead, Jesus immediately launches into an agricultural metaphor. He speaks of seeds needing to fall to the earth and cracking open, dying, for there to be a new plant and fruit and additional seeds.  “Okay…..what might this have to do with us,” his disciples are muttering at this point.  “We’re fishermen, remember?  What’s with the farming metaphors?”  Then, with little warning, comes Jesus’ punch line:  “Those who love their life will lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.”  “Oh no,” I can imagine the disciples sighing with exasperation, “here he goes again with the self-sacrifice part.”\\n\\t\\n\\tI am afraid we are not eager to hear these words of Jesus either.  For starters, what on earth does Jesus mean that we should “hate” our life?  This, from a man who so clearly reveled in life, to the point of the religious leaders claiming he was a glutton and winebibber?   Here was a man who apparently enjoyed good conversation, wedding feasts and lengthy dinner parties, people from all walks of life including young children, sly jokes, flowers of the field and birds of the air. He just didn’t talk much about “hating” things or people.   Jesus clearly loved life.   Something else is going on here.\\n\\t\\n\\tOur Thursday night study group this week grappled with this notion of loosing ones life in order to gain it.  We were discussing a chapter in Cynthia Bourgeault’s book, Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind, that explored what she calls Jesus’ “self-emptying love” (p. 62ff).  We were struck by the author’s statement:  “My hunch is that a good many of the difficulties we sometimes run into trying to make our Christianity work stem from the fact that right from the start people missed how different Jesus’ approach really was.”  “In Jesus,” Bourgeault continues, “everything hangs together around a single center of gravity, and you need to know what this center is before you can sense the subtle but cohesive power of the path he is laying out.”  As we considered this passage, we remembered how Jesus would say that “the first shall be last, the last shall be first.”  He told people to give their cloak, their other cheek, their food, themselves, to the other.  In letters to the early churches, the Apostle Paul will describe this as Jesus empting himself and being born in human likeness, humbling himself and being obedient to the point of death on the cross (Philippians 2:9-16).  Paul will use the Greek word kenosis, “to let go” or “to empty oneself” in speaking of this path.   \\n\\t\\n\\tAlways, the self-emptying, the letting-go.  Loosing our lives in order to gain them.   The seed needs to die and crack open so the new life can spring forth and there can be more seeds of new life.  Jesus offers us a difficult question to ponder:  what within each of us needs to die, in order for us to live more fully?  Perhaps it is a habit?  A grievance or resentment we harbor?  A misguided perception about the world?  Sometimes things “die” in our lives, but not by our own choice.  I realize now, as I look back over my life, that some things had to die, to disappear, from my life in order for me to mature and grow spirituality.  Some things had to be lost.  Only after a painful divorce did I open myself to a deeper sense of my own personal autonomy and responsibility.  The process emerged slowly, through supportive friends and family, counsel of professionals, prayer and simply sinking into the loss.  This, in turn, enabled more healthy adult relationships and my eventual re-marriage.  Years later, I lost my job as a hospital chaplain in that institutions downsizing.  I felt bereft and panicked, but eventually recognized my deep desire to return to being a parish minister.  I certainly would not have initiated either of these difficult losses in my 30’s under my own steam.  But I had to let myself fall into them, self-empty into them, so I could move out the other side to someplace new within myself.\\n\\n\\tI have found that this question of self-emptying, of loosing to gain, of even distaining our life in this world, to be important for churches in the interim period.  I’m not too pleased with thinking of Jesus using the “hate” word, but I catch his drift.  When he speaks of us needing to hate “world,” the word used here in Greek is “kosmos.”  The Biblical commentator Charles Campbell notes that the word “kosmos” is “not synonymous with God’s creation, but is rather the fallen realm that exists in estrangement from God and is organized in opposition to God’s purposes,” (Feasting on the Word, Year B, Volume 2, p. 141, edited by David L. Bartlett and Barbara Brown Taylor).  “The world,” he suggests, is a superhuman reality, concretely embodied in structures and institutions, that aggressively shapes human life and seeks to hold human beings captive to its ways.”  The “world,” Campbell continues, is better translated “the System,” whose ways are dominated by consumerism, violence, domination, and is driven by “institutions that perpetuate racism, sexism, heterosexism.”   \\n\\n\\tThese are strong words, but I think they bring us closer to what Jesus is talking about.  The ways of the world, the “kosmos,” work against God’s intentions for us and we are called to “die” to these ways.  Given Jesus’ seed metaphor:  What is it within a congregation that may need to die and crack open, so we can live more fully into God’s purposes for us?  \\t What ways of the church world may need to die for God to more fully work through us?\\n\\n\\n\\tJesus was constantly talking about this: the great reversal that we don’t expect.  The loss, when faced and embraced, that leads to gain.  I find these to be oddly hopeful questions in my own life and also in the congregations that I serve during interim periods. \\n\\n\\tI had a good chuckle with one of our Property Ministry Team members the other day about church furniture.  And no, I don’t mean about the Sanctuary altar, about which there has been considerable debate in our congregation of late.  This faithful servant has been hauling out all kinds of things from corners and closets downstairs, and has discovered a huge cache of old children’s-sized wood and metal chairs.  We smiled at the thought of all those chairs being filled once, and hopefully again, by young children.  I realized that these very chairs were a potent symbol of the many children here during the post-war Protestant church “heyday,” from the 1950’s up until about the ‘80’s.  These stacked, unused chairs can be a sad reminder of shrinking numbers as we have moved into the 21st century.  \\n\\n\\tBut it occurred to me that these empty chairs could also be a symbol of the important changes in how we share the Christian faith and the Jesus way with children.  Just as there have been many changes in public school teaching over the last 30-40 years, we no longer insist children sit attentively in a chair for hours on end, while we pour Bible facts and stories into the supposedly empty container of their brains.   This was the Christian Education strategy of my childhood, now dismissively labeled as the “banking theory of CE.”  Teachers made “deposits” into the empty “accounts” of a child’s brain, assuming that the child could “draw on” these investments later in adult life as a Christian. It’s important to acknowledge that many children taught in this manner are no longer part of faith communities as adults, nor are their children.  We are realizing now that something may not have “stuck” for many of our adult children, and this is a great loss for us as parents and grandparents of certain generations.\\n\\tIn weekday school and in our Sunday programs, we no longer assume that children all learn in the same way.  We invite imaginative questioning, movement, artistic expression and emerging technology, in ways that go beyond the flannel boards and passive sitting of my Sunday school experience as a child.  We now know that children’s faith is powerfully formed as they are a part of the church’s wider life together: we find we need more inclusive ways of worshiping, singing, exploring scripture and praying together.  \\n\\n\\tAnd it’s not just about children.  We have come to realize that all of us need interaction with different ages, and the perspectives of different generations, to grow in our faithfulness.  We don’t need children because they are cute and say amusing things.  Jesus says we must become like them in order to enter the Kingdom of God!  Inquisitive, open, ever restless to know and experience more.  We all need intergenerational interaction in service projects like sandwich making for local homeless shelters, or all church cleanup days where there are tasks for all sizes and capabilities.  All ages need all ages.\\n\\n\\tYes, the empty chairs may symbolize what has been lost in churches all around the country:  a certain commonality between generations, of shared experiences and values that just isn’t prevalent anymore.  But in this loss of a common culture, we are beginning to see that we are gaining new perspectives as we talk and listen to one another.  We can practice learning about the “other,” we open our hearts to other people in order to experience and see things differently from us.  We become better equipped to move among and appreciate our increasingly diverse communities and wider world.  \\n\\n\\tChurches that are thriving and growing in vitality, have learned to address this hunger for cross-generational and cross-experience connections.  We are learning to name the losses, and how some things must die for new life to emerge.  May we continue this steady process of discovering what we are gaining by these unexpected losses and changes around us.  This is the path of abundant life, eternal life in this present moment.  May God enable us to lose, and to gain, gracefully.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\\n\\tDry bones?  Coming to life?  Now this is a strange story!   Were you counting the “ruachs?”  The Hebrew word that Skip told us about, the word that can mean breath, wind or spirit?   Keep that number in your head for a minute.  Let’s first explore where this story comes from, because it may help us understand it better.\\n\\tA long time ago, about 500 years before Jesus was born, Jewish  ancestors were living in the Middle East.  For centuries, their leaders had been wise, faithful and honest.  The huge beautiful Temple in Jerusalem was built, where people would come from miles around to worship and celebrate festivals.  Everyone took care of the poor people, the widows and orphans.  But the powerful people began to get selfish, and there were a series of bad kings who were greedy and didn’t take care of the needy, and they let there be statues of other gods inside our beautiful Temple where we worshipped.   The leaders became weak and made bad agreements with other countries. Foreign armies wanted to take over all our ancestors land.  One powerful country from the east, called the Babylonians,  surrounded the lands around Jerusalem.  Region by region was overrun.  Towns were burned, crops were destroyed, people were killed.  But the Babylonians wanted more than land; they wanted people-power.  So they captured all our leaders and scholars and priests and artists and craftspeople and musicians, and put them in chains.  They dragged them off to their capital city far-away and made them work for the Babylonians.  One of the people that got dragged off was a man named Ezekiel.  \\n\\tEzekiel was a prophet – meant that he listened carefully to God and had a special job to remind the Jewish leaders and people about how they were to follow in God’s ways.  Ezekiel was very worried about his people, especially when he heard the news that their beautiful house of worship, their huge amazing Temple in Jerusalem had also been destroyed when the Babylonians finally burned the whole city to the ground.  The people felt so abandoned and now they lived in exile.  They felt like a part of them had died; like they were dry skeletons.  If God’s house in the Temple was destroyed, where was God now?  Would they ever be able to go home?  What would be left there if they went back?  The people were very sad and scared.\\n\\tOne night Ezekiel had a dream.  He saw some very curious things and he heard God talking to him.  Here’s where the bones come in!  See if you can picture this in your imagination:  a valley with step hills going up each side.  Very dry, no grass, only scruffy low bushes, lots of rock on the hard dry ground.  And all over the ground of this hot dry valley are piles of bones.  Human bones!  \\n\\tThink for a moment about your bones.  Feel them under your skin.  Our bones are pretty important – they hold us up.  God made us so that muscle and sinew wraps around each of our bones,  and holds them all together.  The bones of our head protect our brain, and our rib bones hold up and protect our other inside parts like our heart, lungs.  But when we die, our body changes.  God made it this way.  All the soft parts of us slowly fall apart and disappear.  But the bones are left.  The bones Ezekiel saw in his vision had been left out in the sun for a long time.  They were bare and white and all piled in a jumble.\\n\\t“What the heck is this?” we might imagine Ezekiel saying.  And as he looks at this huge pile of bones he hears God call out to him:  “Human, can these bones live?”  “uhhh…you tell me!” Ezekiel answers.  And God tells Ezekiel to speak to the bones: “hear the word of God!  I will put new sinew and flesh and skin and will put breath into you!”\\n\\tSo, Ezekiel starts talking to all these bones.  Maybe he felt kind of silly doing this, but he does it anyway.  He says what God told him to say.  And all of a sudden he hears a rattling, a noise like bones coming together.  And all of a sudden he seems the bones fitting together and sinew and flesh and skin on them.  But they aren’t going anywhere.  Still on the ground.  No breath is in them!  \\n\\tThere it is – the word Skip asked you to count!  Breath, wind, spirit – all the same word in Hebrew – ruach!   How many?  A lot.  The storyteller wants us to know how very important God’s breath, God’s animating spirit really is.  I counted 10.  God tells Ezekiel to call the four winds from the four directions of the world – another way to talk about God’s breath and spirit.  It’s the stuff that God breathed into the first humans when he created them.  This is what God breathes into the bones in Ezekiel’s dream – and suddenly what was a pile of piles and muscle and skin all of a sudden stands up!  “What does this mean,” Ezekiel thinks to himself as he dreams.  “I will bring you up out of your graves…put my spirit, my breath, within you and you shall live” said God.  \\n\\tAnd this was the message Ezekiel took to his people:  He woke up in the morning and told the people:  God is right here with us, even though we are stuck in this awful place in Babylon.  God is breathing new life into us, bit by bit we are rebuilding – it takes time - and helping us to stand up and move forward.  God is here.  God will bring us home.   It took awhile, but the people did not lose hope.  Eventually the armies of Persia took over Babylon and the Jewish people were allowed to go home and rebuild their lives.    \\n\\tSometimes change takes awhile, doesn’t it.  But God says “these dry bones can live!”\\n**It seems like it has been taking a long time for winter to change into spring, but slowly it is happening.  God’s breath, God’s spirit works within the sun and the rain and the growing of the plants around us.  “These dry bones can live.”\\n**Sometimes things go wrong with the people we love.  We hurt each other.  It makes us feel lonely and dry inside.  But we ask God to guide us and fill us with a spirit of love and hope.  We slowly reconnect and our relationships come back to life.   “These dry bones can live.”\\n**Sometimes we feel like we have made so many mistakes that things will never be right again.  But God’s healing spirit comes to us through other people we can trust: like a friend who listens and encourages us, a small group at church, or community like AA or NA or a cancer support group and we feel ourselves coming back to life.   We need to keep reminding each other this:  These dry bones can stand again and can live!\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tWe have come to the final request of the Lord’s Prayer: “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.”  As Protestant Christians, we are used to the prayer continuing with closing words of praise, “for thine is the Kingdom and the glory, forever.”  This ending was probably added by Matthew’s early church in the late part of the first century, and used in their worship time together.  Notice on front of the worship bulletin that they are only found in Matthew.  \\n\\tJesus ended his prayer he taught his followers by focusing on some of the more troubling aspects of our human condition:  temptation, trial, evil.  For me, this part of Jesus’ prayer raises difficult questions about why and how we mess up, hurt ourselves, others and the planet; why we sin.  Whose responsibility is it to corral and subdue evil in the world?  Is it God’s job to get rid of evil?  If we are God’s partners in healing God’s worldwide Household, what of this is our job?  How does God “keep us from evil; keep our going out and our coming in” as the Psalmist of our Hebrew scriptures claimed?  And what do we mean by evil?  A personified devil figure who runs around making trouble? Individual breaches of morality, and defined by who?   Or are we talking about bigger systemic evils, like genocide of Native America peoples or the rise of Hitler Germany?  Slavery of Africans, the Christian crusades of medieval times, the spread of ISIS?   Whew….shall we stop right now and go to brunch?  This final part of the Lord’s Prayer is complicated…..and hugely important to understanding what Jesus was doing.\\t\\n\\t“Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil.” When I was a child, I had a small picture book about the Lord’s Prayer.  It was filled with lovely water-color paintings meant to catch a child’s attention; the illustration I remember most clearly went with this passage we are considering today.  A late summer scene with trees and lush green grass, and a small group of children starting to climb over a split-rail fence.  On the other side of the fence is an apple tree; its leafy branches heavy with ripe red fruit.  Ah…forbidden fruit!   An angel-type figure is standing next to the children with its arms raised.  I could never quite figure this one out.  Was the angel trying to stop the kids from the illegal deed of apple stealing?  Was the angel enticing them to pick the apples and God was then supposed to stop them?   All I remember is some vague notion about God wanting me not to be naughty.\\t\\n\\tWe often assume temptation or trial is just about individual morality.  So we pray, “God, help me not eat that extra piece of pie; God help me stay off those web sites that are full of all kinds of virtual temptation.”  Sometimes the purpose of Christianity gets reduced to “Preventing Individual Naughtiness.”   God becomes “The Great Dispenser of Discipline.”   We start to assume we get punished if we are naughty and rewarded if we are nice. \\n\\tUnfortunately, some people stay stuck reacting to this reward/punishment view through much of their lives, and it tics them off:  “I don’t need anyone to tell me what to do! I’m in control of my own life!  I can take care of myself; I’m not dependent on anyone!”   And if we do hold onto this view of God as the Great Enforcer of Proper Behavior into adulthood, we end up resenting it at some level.  If our good behavior isn’t rewarded, we may feel unjustly treated in some way.  “Hey, I behaved myself and didn’t get my reward of good health and prosperity!” \\n\\tWe vacillate between wanting to “go it on our own,” and then wondering why God doesn’t intervene and squash all evil.  And we end up missing the point of Jesus’ message.  We are created to be coworkers, partners, with God in healing the broken world Household of God.  To take responsibility for our own behavior and not expect rewards and punishments.  \\n\\tWhat might have been Jesus’ original meaning here in this part of the prayer?  The Greek word in the Lord’s Prayer that is translated as temptation can also mean trial or test.  And there is probably no better place to understand what Jesus was talking about here, than to look at the time when Jesus himself was sorely tempted, put to the test:  What we call the “temptations in the wilderness,” when Jesus retreated for a time of prayer and fasting right after his baptism in the Jordan River by John at the beginning of his public ministry.  \\n\\tDuring our Bible study on this passage last Tuesday, one of you noted how “hallucinatory” this story sounded.  Dusty, dry isolated terrain; consciousness possibly altered by days of fasting, silence and aloneness.  Is this inner dialogue or confrontation with an external evil entity?  We are not sure.  Jewish mythology had no strong personification of evil, like the devil figure that is vividly depicted in medieval art and literature of the later Christian era.  Matthew describes that the tempter puts it to Jesus:  “Hey, you must be hungry: doesn’t God provide manna for all?  Satisfy your own hunger: Turn these stones into bread.”  Jesus and the tempter end up in a war of words, slinging Hebrew Bible passages back and forth.  “No?” sneers the tempter.  “Well, how about something a little more public, come up to the top of the top pinnacle tower of the Jerusalem Temple and jump and let’s give the folks a display of miraculous power!  Hmmm?  Okay (continues the tempter) How about dominion over all the world powers?  You keep saying the Kingdom of God is at hand!  Let’s bring it on, Jesus!  Let’s smash these evil human powers and bring God’s righteous reign in by force!”  Be that warrior leader everyone wants!”   Jesus refuses; the tempter departs. \\n\\tTempter, devil, evil one – all different translations of a Greek verbal noun comprised of “dia” and “ballo” – meaning “to throw over or across” – or one who attacks, misleads, discredits.  And who/whatever this entity is, it has a one-track mind – it’s all about power – “take it Jesus, it’s yours by right, since you are the Son of God.  This is a royal title attributed to the ancient Jewish Davidic line: Be that warrior prince, that Messiah, Jesus!  Be who you are!”  \\n\\tJesus had grown up in Nazareth after a huge military incursion of Roman legions in 4 BC, which brutally squashed violent rebellions among the Jewish people.   Roman power continues at this time to oppress the people, demanding excessive taxes, military service, and most repugnant, worshipping Caesar as God.  How very tempting to think that more violence might be the answer.   Perhaps this is the toughest challenge in this prayer and in Jesus’ teachings: again and again Jesus will refuse violence as the way to bring in the Kingdom, the Reign, of God.\\n\\tAn aside on sin: There are growing number of Biblical scholars who say that humans’ original sin was not the disobedience of eating fruit from a tree in the Garden of Eden.  They point to the first time the word “sin” is used in Hebrew scriptures of the Old Testament: the Cain and Abel story.  These two sons of the mythical Adam and Eve story were strong rivals.  Cain ended up killing his brother.  In response, God warns, for the first time, of “sin lurking at their door.”  What was the sin?  Escalating violence that seeks not just to defend but to retaliate.  And escalatory violence was starting to look pretty tempting to many of those under Roman imperial oppression in the first century during Jesus time and Jesus knew it was a dead end.  \\n\\tI think of difficult times I have been through in my life, times when I had the choice between depending upon my own limited understanding and human strength, flailing around…. or working with God to figure out what God was calling me to next in the middle of the mess.  Think of one of your own times of trial and testing in your family or this church’s history.  Have we been reactive and destructive as we struggled to cope?  There are forms of escalating violence that are damaging even without physical blows.  It may be that Jesus turned from following John the Baptist simply because John was preaching a coming of the Kingdom through violence against Rome.  This God who arrives imminently will be an avenging presence!  \\n\\tBut not so for Jesus.   He will command his followers to put away their swords when he is confronted and arrested by Roman soldiers in the Garden of Gethsemane.   The church in each generation has got to grapple with the implications of Jesus’ call to non-violence. A difficult challenge in a world where evil persists and there are never easy answers or simple solutions.\\n\\tThe curious thing about times of crisis, trial and testing is that while they can break us, they have the curious potential to change us and re-define us.  Do I see myself as a passive recipient of God’s rewards and punishments?  Do I rely on my own insight and strength?  Or do I reach out to God and to others in these challenging times, acknowledging my full membership in God’s family?  Do I see my part in the mess; recognize and confess my sins, repent and change my ways?  Individual and group character can be tempered and shaped in such times.   \\n\\tFor some reason, God has placed us in a world that is both beautiful and dangerous, good and evil, and filled with wonder and resources and unpredictability.   This is our life.  Where will we each face temptation this week?  Be on the alert.  Know that we are free to work with God, to resist evil, to help heal the world and delight in it together.  And so we are urged to pray, “lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe full moon was still a fuzzy bright haze in the western sky early this morning.  I had stepped outside in the predawn darkness to retrieve my newspaper.  I watched in the chllly silence as the white orb slipped out from the cloud cover and hung above the horizon.   I noticed how oddly colorful the whole scene around me looked:  trees, grass, houses, even in the dark of still night.  Greys, blues, silvers.  The French Impressionist artist, Vincent Van Gough, painted a lot of night scenes, and once remarked that “I think the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.”  The picture in my minds eye the rippling celestial whirls of his painting, “Starry Night.”  Haunting, compelling. Even right before dawn, the dark hours can seem shadowy, mysterious, sometimes unnerving…..and they fascinate us.  \\n\\tThe Gospel writer John often used nighttime settings as he described Jesus’ own struggle with his mission, and also people’s reactions to Jesus.  Darkness became a symbol of confusion, unbelief, temptation…and of choices and possibility, in his Gospel.  Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus, predawn darkness of discovering the empty tomb. The writer John would contrast images of light and darkness, and describe Jesus as being the Light of the world.  Today, we hear a story of a man who journeys out into the darkness of night, wending his way through the unlit streets of Jerusalem.   Jesus and his disciples have arrived in Jerusalem for the Jewish Passover and what will unfold as Jesus’ inevitable confrontation with the religious and political authorities.  The Pharisee Nicodemus was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders.  An important man - but why sneak around in the dark?  Was he worried what his Jerusalem colleagues would think?  Many of the Pharisees were increasingly concerned that Jesus’ teachings and rabble rousing would bring down the wrath of the Romans on the whole Jewish community.  But there was this ancient tradition that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the complexities and marvel of the text.  Some would suggest that Nicodemus was a true seeker, had been paying attention to Jesus teaching and healing work, and now came to “study” him, in the quiet of the night (Patricia Farris, Christian Century, Jan. 30-Feb. 6, 2002).\\n\\tNicodemus begins by respectfully addressing Jesus as “rabbi.”  But we hear the caution in his words; he politely acknowledging Jesus is from God, (not divine, from God) because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  But this affirmation seems of little concern to Jesus.  He ignores Nicodemus’ respectful opening words, and makes this curt and curious pronouncement:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  Whoa…What? replies Nicodemus?  \\n\\tAnd this is where the warning lights start to flash for some of us and we mentally screech to a halt.  This language of being born again and also the 3:16 verse about believing so you can have eternal life has been incredibly divisive in the Christian church.  And it has made for a lot of stereotypes and bad press about purportedly exclusive Christian claims.  I am talking about the assumption that You are either in or you are out depending on what you believe.  This has had disastrous historical consequences, of course, as anyone considered out has had various times  been shamed, excluded, persecuted and/or killed.  One my favorite young Biblical commentators, Anna Carter Florence from Columbia Theological Seminary, writes:  These passages have become a “staple of highway road signs and bumper stickers and football games.  It is shorthand for a certain kind of religious fervor…..before a preacher has any room to do her job (with this passage), she has to muck out a lot of stalls.”   But don’t ignore the stall!\\n\\tShall we clean out this theological language stall a bit?  The Gospel writer John uses the word anaothen for born in verse three: “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  This word “Born” has double meaning in Greek:  anaothen means both “from above” and it means “again or anew.”  Unfortunately, most Bibles chose one meaning or the other and we lose this intentionally ambiguous reply and meaning of Jesus.  It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem.”  \\nWhat is Jesus doing here?  For Jesus, “The Kingdom of God” is both a place (of justice, peace and healing) and a time (bursting into this present moment).  Clearly, new birth is going to enable a new kind of relating to God; this is where Jesus is going.   But another way to think about this is to play with the idea of consciousness.  Perhaps the Kingdom of God is “a place you come from”  in Jesus’ experience.  A different state of consciousness.  This is where the contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault goes in her book Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind – a New Perspective on Christ and His Message, p. 30.  It’s as though Jesus is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension.  Bourgeault suggests that the KOG of God is actually a “whole new way of looking at the world.  A transformed awareness that literally turns the world into a different place….a world that doesn’t make separations between God and humans, between humans and humans, between humans and creation…”a world of mutual abiding” she describes it.  Not like Eastern traditions that speak of human beings as being divine and thus being one with the divine.  Something different.  A complete mutual indwelling of different entities, an indwelling that already IS that we begin to experience through spiritual practices of prayer and meditation.  Practices that begin to change our consciousness so we begin to see our neighbor’s being as a continuation of our own…and our neighbor’s well-being as a continuation of our own well-being.  I think Bourgeault is on to some of the more revolutionary aspects of Jesus’ teachings.  Might we do a book study together and some spiritual practice experimenting together?!\\nPerhaps as Jesus watches Nicodemus face, he continues: “Yes, Nicodemus, this seems shadowy and confusing to you, much like the dark night.”  It’s almost as if Nicodemus can’t see the bright shining moon emerging from the clouds that is Jesus right before him. Nicodemus can’t see or imagine himself being born again or anew or from above. That journey looks too unknown, too problematic, too risky. He gets stuck in a literal interpretation:  “how in the world can you go back into your mother’s womb?” The man just can’t grasp that Jesus is talking about a transformative experience of the living God through knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to the Jesus in front of him.  \\n\\t“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have everlasting life,” Jesus continued.  What was he really saying to Nicodemus?  “You have to get your thinking straightened out?  Your theological concepts need to be correct?”  In story after story of encounters with Jesus, people are not grilled about their theological beliefs about him before he will talk with them, heal them, help them.   The Greek word for \"belief\" used here is less about an intellectual concept and more about an action. \\xa0The Greek work\\xa0credo,\\xa0\"I believe,\" is more accurately translated as \"I give my heart to\" or \"I trust in.\" \\xa0What is Jesus asking Nicodemus to give his heart to, to trust in? \\xa0The key here seems to be what is meant by “eternal life.”  All too often we immediately think of some heavenly, blissful existence where we live forever after we die.  And how are we going to get there, or not.  Right belief? Moral actions through a lifetime?  Throughout John’s gospel, however, the words “eternal life” are used to describe something else: the Interpreter’s Bible commentary describes this as “the change in human existence brought by faith, (trust) in Jesus.” (Interpreter’s Bible, Volume IX, p. 552).  A change in human existence, now, in the present moment!   Living one’s life defined by God’s presence, guidance and will.  “Eternal life” is connected to the other metaphor so frequently seen in this gospel:  Jesus’ promise that he has come to bring “life, and life abundantly.”  \\n\\t\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what happened to Nicodemus after that late night encounter with Jesus.  “Jesus said that I must be born again, or be born from above or be born anew….hmmmmm…..something about starting again….being born of the spirit….How can these things be?”  he may have muttered to himself.  As he walked back to his home through the quiet streets of the ancient city, perhaps he recalled the steady, glowing brightness of Jesus’ presence, his intensity of being.  Something must have started to work in Nicodemus that night, because later, when the chief priests and Pharisees want to have him arrested, Nicodemus will insist that Jesus have a hearing before them first.   And perhaps most significant, it will be Nicodemus who joins Joseph of Arimathea to remove Jesus body from the cross after he is executed.  Nicodemus will bring pounds of spices with which to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.\\n\\tPerhaps this is how “born again,” “born anew” happens for many of us.  In the uneasy dimness of our lives, we encounter a growing light.  It’s like moonbeams streaming across our darkened landscape, and we come closer to it.  We don’t just want theological information; we yearn for a way in. The spirit of the Living Jesus provides both context and illumination.  He waits for us in the quiet shadows of our hearts, ready to listen and to guide us.  May we meet him there.   Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Our bright lingering fall has finally shifted into the chilly foretaste of winter. In northern Europe during pre-Christian time, autumn was not just a grateful harvest event, but also a period of growing reflectiveness, even uneasiness.  It was a season when people in northern climes considered the precariousness of life and remembered those who had died.  \\n\\nPerhaps it is no accident that, each fall, the Christian church’s liturgical calendar spirals us around again to all Saint’s Day.  But one might well wonder:  how does thinking about people who have died help us face winter?  Yet this is what ancient peoples would do.  Celtic religious leaders proclaimed an “end-of-year festival where they would ritually re-enact the “death of death,” and with it, affirm the possibilities of new life in spring. The people would light huge bonfires, burn sacrifices and pray to dispel evil spirits.  Their symbolic language and rituals opened the doors of their perceptions about the holy and about themselves.  This was a time when the veil between the seen and unseen world was considered to be quite thin; they believed that both the community and the individual had a part in acknowledging and managing this sacred divide.  They would honor their dead who surrounded them like a cloud of witnesses.  Each family unit would bravely extinguish their home fire, and then carefully relight it from the “sacred flame of the village bonfire,” and the New Year would begin.  \\n\\nAs early Christian missionaries entered the Celtic regions of France and the British isles, they brought the language of the “death of death” in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  This theology of hope and eternal life conquering death resonated with many of the people.  The institutional Church slowly incorporated pre-Christian festivals and new symbolic language and liturgies emerged.  All Hallows Eve, All Saints Day, All Souls Day.  As more people of Hispanic and Latino descent become part of the multi-colored fabric of our own American culture, we’ve learned of a similar custom of celebrating “El Dia de los Muertos,” or  “Day of the Dead.”  A festive time of telling stories those who had died, visiting and tending family graves.  A day to acknowledge both dying and living, the cycle of life.\\n\\n\\tThe ancients also acknowledged this time of year as a “thin place” when the boundaries, the veil, between the past and the present, the living and the dead, thinned. As I pay attention to nature’s changes around me and the draw of memory within me, God seems oddly closer, more attentive almost.  I think of people who are no longer in my life.  I wonder about my own seemingly saintly and sinful self and the choices that have emerged from my mixed human nature. \\n\\t\\n\\tIn the middle of my autumnal ponderings this year, I re-discovered these words of Danish theologian Søren Kierkegaard: \"There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.\"  Applying this more universally, I would paraphrase:  “there is nothing with which we each are so afraid as getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  \\n\\t\\n\\tPut yet another way, is there something unsettling about how saintly we might be?  Few of us really want too appear “saintly.”  Adult costume stores sell far more sin-oriented costumes at Halloween than saintly outfits.  When praised we might even mutter gruffly, “don’t get me wrong, I’m no saint.”  Yet, the apostle Paul addresses the church members in Ephesus as saints, “hagio” in Greek meaning “God’s holy ones.”  According to the Book of Acts, this is how early Christians referred to each other. The word was not meant to imply that these people were holy as in perfect but that by association with God through Jesus Christ they were holy, whole. Even with our propensity to makes mistakes, to hurt others, to ignore God….to “sin” we would say theologically….We are God’s holy ones.  \\n\\n\\tThe faith language of “saint” and “sinner” opens the doors of my inner perception so I might humbly and courageously understand my place and call in God’s world.  Perhaps this is where Paul was going when he wrote to his friends in Ephesus:  “I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ…may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know God, so that with the eyes of your heart enlightened, so you may know what is the hope to which God has called you, what are the riches of God’s glorious inheritance among the saints.”  \\n\\n\\tThe most fearful thing for us, writes Kierkegaard, is “getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  Capable of sin, capable of holiness and wholeness.  Other writers have referred to the human tendency to “play small.”  In what ways might each of us “play small” in our personal lives, in our work lives?  We can play small regarding our sin, ignoring our actions as perpetrators or bystanders to betrayal and hurt.  We can play small regarding our holiness, our call to be a saint, minimizing our gifts and talents.  How might we be “playing small” as a congregation, in ways that limit what God might want to do here?    How might we more fully affirm and live out this hope, this inheritance, that God has calls us to?\\n\\n\\tThe quaint hymn we sang as we began worship, “I sing a Song of the Saints of God,” affirms that the saints are all around us and are us. Not perfect people, mind you, but people who are often patient, brave and true.  As we remember those saints who have been among you here at Falcon Heights, and in our family lives, we might think about their patience and consider how we might be more patient with one another.  We can remember their bravery and truthfulness, and consider how we each might be braver in both our private lives and our wider public lives, and more truthful about all kinds of things. Surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, the “eyes of our hearts” are opened to new things we are capable of doing and being as a church.  We step forward to spread God’s good news to new generations, because we to are God’s holy ones, saints and sinners, all.  Amen.\\n\\nNovember 1, 2008\\t\\t\\t\\tAll Saints’ Day Sunday\\nOlivet Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\tRuth 1:1-18\\nSt. Paul, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPsalm 34:1-8\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\tEphesians 1:11-22,2:8-10\\n\\n\\nSAINTS AND SINNERS, ALL!\\n\\n\\tAs I get to know a new congregation, I’m always curious to know what books are shaping the member’s Christian faith.  Of late I’m finding that I also need to ask about which websites or blogs people are regularly following that both challenge and sustain their sense of connection with God and God’s call in their lives.  New on my personal radar is a weekly Biblical Lectionary-based blog by a Methodist minister and artist, Jan Richardson.  Called the “Painted Prayerbook,” each week it features a photo of her most recent paper collage which she creates in response to the weekly Lectionary passages.  Pictured next to this week’s abstract collage for All Saints’ Day, she writes:\\n\\t“I’m not sure quite when it started, but for many years, the trinity of days from October 31 to November 2, encompassing Halloween, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day, has been a thin place in the landscape of my year. The ancient Celtic peoples,…believed that the veil between worlds became especially permeable at this time. In something of that spirit, I find that these days offer an invitation to ponder the past. Not with a desire to return to it, or to second-guess it, but with a mindfulness of what has gone before, and perhaps to have a brief visit from the ghosts of What Might Have Been.\\nIt’s this kind of impulse that gave rise to the feasts of All Saints and All Souls. (Richardson continues)  Recognizing the ancient habit of looking to the past at this time of year, the church created new ways to remember the dead with practices in which we can still hear the echoes of the ancient celebrations. Each culture that observes these feast days continues to add their own layers of meaning and mystery, as with the Day of the Dead celebrations that originated in Mexico …. My own observance of these days usually includes setting aside some time for quiet, for remembering...”\\n\\t“A thin place in the landscape” of the year.  These words have resonated in me this week and I have noticed that Late autumn, on the brink of winter, has often felt this way to me.  At this time of year, I have found that the distinction between past and present fades at odd moments. Low slant of yellow light, early nightfall.   Unexpectedly, the perceived distance between me and God’s mystery will close at the oddest moments.  I gaze down the street and am startled by yet another burning bush.  The green of tree leaves seems to drain away around me, heaping into dried piles at my feet.  There is a reflective quiet for me in these days, if I pause to notice amidst my busyness.   What do you notice in this season? Sometimes I feel achingly joyful and other times strangely melancholy. And, as I pay attention to nature’s shifts around me and the draw of memory within me, God seems oddly closer, more attentive almost.  I think of people who are no longer in my life.  I remember times of glowing success and times of disappointment or failure. I ponder my own seemingly saintly and sinful self and the choices that have eminated from that mixed nature.   \\n\\tIn the middle of my autumnal ponderings this year, I re-discovered these words of Danish theologican Søren Kierkegaard: \"There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.\"  Applying this more universally, I’ll read it again:  “there is nothing with which we each are so afraid as getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  \\n\\tPut another way, is there something frightening about how saintly we might be?  As I thought about All Saints’ Day this year it occurred to me that in a strange, self-deprecating way, none of us really want to appear “saintly.”  Adult costume stores sell far more sin-oriented costumes at Halloween than saintly outfits, I’m sure.  When praised we might even mutter gruffly, “don’t get me wrong, I’m no saint.”.     Yet, the apostle Paul addresses the church members in Ephesis as saints, “hagio” in Greek meaning “God’s holy ones.”  The word was not meant to imply that these people were holy as in perfect but that by association with God through Jesus Christ they were holy.  “Saved by grace through faith.” That’s all of us, “inheritors” so we “might live for the praise of God’s glory.”  We are God’s holy ones.  I admit, there is something a bit overwhelming in claiming our sainthood.\\n\\tThe most fearful thing for us, writes Kierkegaard, is “getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  I wonder if this is true also for groups of people, like faith communities.  In mulling over K’s quote I am reminded of the phrase that often gets attributed to Nelson Mandela but apparently was written by the New Age spirituality author Marianne Williamson:  “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,” she writes, “Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure…. You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.”  In what ways might each of us “play small” in our personal lives, in our work lives?  How might we be “playing small” as a congregation, in ways that limit what God might want to do here?   \\n\\tThe quaint hymn we sang as we began worship, “I sing a Song of the Saints of God,” affirms that the Saints are all around us and are us. Not perfect people, mind you, but people who are patient, brave and true.  As we remember those “saints” who have been among you here at Olivet, we can think about their patience, their bravery and truthfulness, and consider how we each might be more patient with each other and with ourselves, how we each might be braver in both our private lives and our wider public lives, and more truthful about all kinds of things.  These are certainly qualities we seek in our local and national leaders, as we cast our ballots in the election this week.  In the year ahead, where might we each individually we called to take on these qualities; in what ways might this church be challenged by new circumstances and vision to be patient and brave and true in new ways?\\nThe Bible is full of stories of saints and sinners; some are patient, brave and true, and some are impatient, cowardly and dishonest.  We heard the beginning of the story of Ruth from the Hebrew scriptures today, a poignant tale of three women left with three dead husbands and no means of support.  After one daughter-in-law, understandably, decides to return to her own family of origin, the other daughter-in-law announces she will accompany her mother-in-law Naomi into a new religious life and uncertain future.  Confronted by terrible loss, and the transition loss demands, Naomi makes a courageous decision. The Rev. Peter Gomes, American Baptist minister and Harvard religious studies has written that “to be a saint is a sign not of perfection but of fidelity.”  Fidelity, commitment, faithfulness.  As today’s ancient story unfolds, this tenacious commitment leads Ruth and Naoimi to a new land, with community support for both the women. Ruth, remarries, becomes a mother herself and (as an outsider) becomes part of the ancestral line which eventually leads to Israel’s great King David and finally to Jesus of Nazareth.   The narrator seems eager for us to know that it is Ruth’s faithfulness, with her decision which looks forward and not backward, that is so important. (see Joan Chittister article on Ruth).  \\n\\tSo on this day in late autumn we remember those saints who have died for their faith.  We remember God’s holy ones who dared to publically utter “Jesus is Lord” down through the ages and who were martyered for making not only a profession of faith but a treasonous claim.  We remember those saints, God’s holy ones, who have served God and the world through this church, and we celebrate their patience, bravery and truthfulness.  Inspired by their fidelity, not their perfection, we move into different challenges and expanded opportunities to serve.  Surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, we become aware of new things we are capable of doing and being as a church.  We step out again in faithfulness, to spread God’s good news to new generations.  God’s holy ones, saints and sinners, all.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'We give Bibles to Fourth Graders.  Family Bibles get handed down to the next generation.  We study and debate it’s texts in small groups at Emmaus, some among us read it daily at home and we hear from it each Sunday in worship.   Why?  It can be a confusing, sometimes violent, often obscure and even annoying book.   What authority does it have for each of us?  Throughout the UCC, people see the Bible differently, although there is a general trend not to take scripture literally.   We endeavor to read it in its historical context, using the best tools of modern scholarship to figure out what the various authors had in mind.  We speak of it as being “inspired” but not the literal word of God.  Biblical authority?  Any questions about authority make us nervous; seems to imply controlling people or controlling the church.  N.T. Wright, the Anglican Biblical scholar, has suggested that “authority” also implies that there are correct answers to key questions provided in the Bible.  We assume, he continues, that it is full of rules and regulations to be obeyed and creeds to be believed.  Not so, says N.T. Wright.   Nor is it a compendium of abstract and timeless truth, or a collection of witnesses to events.  Wow, what’s left?  Narrative, Wright answers.  Narrative about God judging, showing mercy to and remaking the world.  Narrative where the first two acts are written, and we the actors are now told to imagine, create and play-out, to enact, the third act ourselves. \\n\\nLet’s take the prophet Jeremiah text first, and see if we can imagine a third act.  588 BCE.  The northern Kingdom of Israel has already fallen to invading brutality of the Assyrians.  The southern Kingdom of Judah, home of Jerusalem and location of the Jeremiah, is now besieged.  Jewish people, rich and poor, have crowded in desperation to the fortified city walls of Jerusalem; food is running out and the enemy is at the gates.  If you have skills, a craft, or money, you will be lucky to be dragged off to Babylon, otherwise a citywide slaughter awaits you.  The Judean King Zedekiah has finally jailed Jeremiah in exasperation, unwilling to tolerate the prophet’s incessant railing against the corrupt governmental practices and threatening God’s punishment. \\n\\nNow imprisoned under palace guard, a word from God comes to Jeremiah.  It appears that in the chaos, a desperate relative of his needs to unload some property.  Perhaps the relative is hoping to get his family out of Jerusalem and head south to Egypt before the impending doom.  Lo and behold, his cousin Hanamel arrives, pleading, “buy my field at Anathoth; you’re my relative and have first right of refusal here.”  \\nWe think we have been in a depressed market!  Everyone is trying to leave, the Babylonians of Assyria are at the city gates; this land is basically worthless!  God has chosen an unexpected and symbolic act to communicate with the people in crisis.\\n\\nJeremiah carefully proceeds with the seemingly unwise purchase, signs the deed, obtains the witnesses, weights the money on the scale.  He even has his personal scribe, Barauch, witness everything, and has Barauch place the sealed deeds of purchase “in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.”   In the midst of the chaos, God is directing Jeremiah to look forward.  Jeremiah’s act reminds the people that God promises, in the middle of the uncertainty and pending dislocation, that “houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.”  Houses, fields, vineyards…when everything is disintegrating around them, God lifts up the future hope of all that makes life possible, stable and fruitful in their culture.  God promises that there will be resources and calm to once again dwell in the land of their ancestors.    \\n\\nThis is the stuff of “hanging in there,” of continuing to lean into God’s promises when things look truly bleak.  What’s the next act look like for us?  We can probably each think back over our lives at the disappointments and maybe even disasters that made us want to just fold up shop.  Why keep investing in a relationship when there has been such disappointment?  How do we keep running this business as returns dwindle?  How do we keep working if the government is going to shut-down next week?  Why keep investing in a particular congregation where there has been betrayal and conflict?  Does “having hope in the future” just look impractical and unwise?     \\nI was reminded this week of another narrative, the story of the Lutheran Theologian and Pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was arrested and killed by the Nazis for allegedly plotting with others to assassinate Adolf Hitler.  A few months before he was imprisoned, he wrote these words about how we must keep investing in the future, even in desperate times:  \"...There remains for us only the very narrow way, often extremely difficult to find, of living every day as if it were our last, and yet living in faith and responsibility as though there were to be a great future. It is not easy to be brave and keep that spirit alive, but it is imperative.\" \\nBonhoeffer reflects on this story from Jeremiah, as he later corresponded with his fiancée Maria von Wedemeyer, from his prison cell.  He writes to her: \"When Jeremiah said, in his people\\'s hour of direst need, that \\'houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land\\', it was a token of confidence in the future. Our marriage must be a \\'yes\\' to God\\'s earth. It must strengthen our resolve to do and accomplish something on earth.\"  \\n\\tThere are different perspectives on just what “confidence in the future” may be.   It is a common misperception that today’s text from the Gospel of Luke, is a cautionary tale about our future in the afterlife.  If we are rich and greedy, and ignore the poor, we will go to some place of punishment, and if we are poor, we will go to some kind of heaven into the bosom of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham.   I don’t think this was Jesus point in telling this story.  His challenge in not unlike Bonhoeffer’s:  our confidence, our hope, in God’s good future is about strengthening our resolve to participate in the good in this life.  How might we bring hope to someone in need, someone who crosses our paths while we are living? Jesus asks his listeners and he proceeds to tell today’s parable.\\nEveryday the rich man had a chance to be that hope to the poor man reduced to begging at his gate.  But the man with the resources lived in a culture that conditioned him to ignore Lazarus sitting at his front door, because Lazarus would be considered ritually “unclean” with his open skin lesions and his constant contact with ritually “unclean” dogs. So often we talk sadly about “the poor” or the “disadvantaged.”  And sometimes we generalize about these people, making hopeless sounding assumptions about their motivation or morals.  We generalize about a lot of people, actually:  “those teenagers,” “the elderly,” “those Muslims,” “that bad neighborhood,” “the druggies,” “those management people at work.”  Our generalizing can carry as exasperated attitude concerning the general futility of helping these groups.  We can lose track of the individuals, each with a separate personhood and unique need.  We sometimes lose track of our call to carry the hope of God’s good future to others. \\nI think of the ways Emmaus brings our collective confidence in their good future to the table.  Collecting our quarters through October, so we can purchase $2500 in rice and soy protein power to package at the Stop Hunger Now event here. Participating in our annual Neighbors in Need offering with the wider UCC.  We become like those earthenware vessels that held the deeds for land that seemed valueless at the time, we too become a “holding place” as we listen to people’s stories and respond to their needs.  We become a vessel of hope for people who feel valueless and hopeless.   This is us writing and acting in the next “act” of God healing the world.\\n\\nIn Jesus’ parable, the rich man is punished at death not because he was rich and greedy.  It’s because he just didn’t see; he averted his eyes and didn’t pay attention to the person right at his door.  Who will we finally “see” this week, that we really didn’t notice before?  Where might we see and affirm value, where the rest of the world sees nothing?  We write the next act in the Biblical narrative with our very lives.  Who needs our time or our resources, who needs our hope in God’s good future?  Thanks be to God that these people will cross our paths, so we may become vessels of hope.   Amen.\\n\\t  \\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIf you were raised in a faith community, what did you learn about money in Sunday School or from your church leaders?  What did you think God thought about money? How did your parents and church leaders talk about money?  Was it an encouraging message?  Or did the pastor or priest harangue folks about giving, giving, giving?!  Did large donors to the church get treated differently than the people who gave less?   \\n\\n\\tWe each bring different experiences about money into the life of a congregation.  And each generation represented in this congregation brings different ideas and attitudes about money, based on when they were born and which generation they identify with.  The World War II generation, and those born during World War II, have quite a different perspective on money.  They often have stayed with one company or business, eventually paid off their home mortgage and may seldom carry a credit card debt.  There is my generation, the Baby Boomers.  We have different ideas about savings and debt and compensation.  There is my own kid’s generation, duly named the Millenials and born from the mid-1980’s up until about 2000.  A generation often mired in school debt, with early access to credit cards, and sometimes unable to find adequate work nor to buy a home of their own.  Perhaps not raised in the church, this generation may have no history or practical knowledge of what it means to support the work of the congregation financially.   And oh yes, how about those kids born in this 21st century?  They are not very old yet, don’t hold jobs or credit cards, but their experience of money is already very different.  Watching parents pay with debit and credit cards, or the flash of a smart phone, they may not even know what paper money or coins look like!  This is getting complicated. Is it any wonder we get all tangled up when talking about money and dealing with finances in the church?\\n\\n\\tIt’s Foundation Sunday, a long standing tradition in this particular congregation.  Not a bad time to do some reflection on money, stewardship and generosity.  It’s a day to welcome the annual gift, which comes from a portion of the interest earned on the balance of the church endowment funds that are held in trust.  Funds accumulated over the years from gifts received.  Gifts from Falcon Heights Church members and friends who affirmed the founding vision of this church, and were hopeful and trusting about the evolving ministries of this congregation.   Gifts given out of a deep desire that the giver’s own positive experiences about God’s power and the blessedness of community could be extended to others, long after he or she had left this earth.  Legacy gifts, given to signal what was most important to the givers.  Gifts that were a sharing of treasure, which give us an idea of where their hearts were at the time of the giving.   This is a good Sunday to think about what we each treasure and how this connects with our spiritual well-being.  \\n\\n\\t“Where your treasure is, there you heart will be also,” said Jesus.  I love the fact that Jesus often talked about money, because it reminds me that Jesus was always practical about the life of faith.  He knew where to touch people, where they were most needy, bringing comfort to the discomforted.  He also knew where to nudge or poke people where they were most stuck, bringing discomfort to the comfortable.   People in his time would often store their treasure in the purchase of extravagant and costly garments; women’s headdresses might be woven with coins.  Not unlike today, with our homes, cars and clothing, you could tell who was of a certain means.  We “store” our treasure in all kinds of places besides banks.  Jesus not only called people out on not giving to the poor, a supreme value and mandate in their Jewish religious tradition.  He also knew that how we “store” our treasure has a lot to do with our spiritual health.  Not whether or not you get into the after-life, but our spiritual well-being in this life.  How attached am I to my possessions, to my stuff?\\n\\n\\tPerhaps you have heard the story of his interaction with a young rich man.  This man approaches Jesus and asks about eternal, abundant life – Jesus, how can I live most fully, most abundantly, both now and in the life to come?  Jesus patiently walks him through the basics of their Jewish faith: are you loving God with your whole heart, mind, body and soul?  Are you following the ten commandments?  Are you acting with love towards your neighbor?  Yes, yes, says the young man.  Well, says Jesus, and you can imagine him eyeing this young man very closely then….had news of this inquirer’s wealth reached Jesus, or perhaps it was obvious in his dress?  Well, first, sell all you have and give it to the poor….and you will have treasure in heaven….then come and follow me.  But “when the young man heard this word, he went away grieving, for he had many possessions.” (Matthew 19:23).   What was the extreme loss this young man was grieving?  He didn’t want to let go of something that he treasured.  But something grieved him in the holding on.  What did he recognize in that moment, with his hands and his heart full of attachment to his possessions?\\n\\n\\tThe apostle Paul later wrote to the Church at Corinth, as he implored them to give generously to help people in need in faraway Jerusalem:  “Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”  It’s a wonderfully ambiguous phrase in Greek:  God loves a cheerful giver.  It also can also be translated: a cheerful giver loves God.  Jesus knew that the rich young man’s love of God and giving away of his possessions were intimately related.\\n\\n\\tGive away your possessions and “you will have treasure in heaven,” said Jesus.  Is this about accumulating brownie points with God, which add up to a certain amount, the scales are tipped and we have access through the pearly gates when we die?  I do not think so.  But what?  It may help to remember that Jesus was constantly reminding people that not only is there an unseen world all around and within us, but the Kingdom of God, God’s reign here on earth, is somewhat obscure.  He knew we have a “default mode” where we tend to think that what we see, feel, taste, touch, measure is the totality of the real world.  Like a default setting on our consciousness (see commentary by Matt Skinner, Professor of New Testament, Luther Seminary, February 25, 2009, on Working Preacher.org <https://www.workingpreacher.org/preaching.aspx?commentary_id=25>).  \\nJesus was always about confronting and shifting our attention, altering our perceptions.  \\n\\n\\tJews in his time were not preoccupied with the afterlife, certainly not in the manner that we Christians became myopically focused on heaven and hell beginning with European medieval times.  When we hear Jesus talk about “heaven” we need to pay attention.  He is referencing the Kingdom of Heaven, the Kingdom of God, God’s reign of peace, justice, mercy and compassion here on earth and within each of us.  Generosity with our money, addressing the needs of the poor, is about something much more basic than heavenly brownie points.  It enables us to put our “treasure” – what is most important to us – in God’s hands.  We make our relationships, our bodies, our families, our possessions, our money, all that we treasure, available for the work of God’s reign among us.  \\n\\n\\tSince you and I live in a money economy, where almost every day we are making some kind of transaction that involves our accumulated money treasure, we have many opportunities to engage this spiritual practices.  And it’s a balance, isn’t it?  We each have responsibilities and obligations related to our money.  Few of us can give it all away.  Somehow we must be fed and sheltered, and do that for our dependents.  But Jesus would say, where is your treasure?  Where is your heart this week?  As we reach for the plastic credit or debt card this week, write a check, perhaps look over our investment portfolio, finger some dollar bills, rattle some change in our pockets, and make the exchange to purchase some additional something ….where will our treasure be?   \\n\\n\\tThanks be to God for those who have gone before us in this congregation and who have generously shared of their treasure through the Foundation Trust fund.  As the Apostle Paul declared:  “…the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints (the church), but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God.”  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tPreaching on Mother’s Day would seem to be a no-brainer.  The Sanctuary is fuller than usual and the theme is so Biblical sounding: sacrificial mother love.  Pastors often welcome this opportunity to relate such mother love to the generosity and persistence of God’s love for humans, and to the seemingly sacrificial love of Jesus.  In spite of the fact that Mother’s Day as we know it in the USA is wildly commercialized, and often overly sentimental.   One would think this is a natural Sunday to make some homiletical hay about the love theme.\\n\\n\\tAnd yet there a few things that give me pause when it comes to Mother’s Day.  It’s not just the commercial overplay, the crowded restaurants, cloying greeting cards and the wild mix of expectations associated with this day.  Over the years, as I have listened to people in my congregations and in my pastoral counseling office, I have learned that both relationships with our mothers, mother memories and the experience of mothering are a complicated mix.   On Mother’s Day we remember that while everyone has literally had a mother, the faith community must recognize that some may have never met that person or have become estranged from her. There are those among us who have mostly happy memories of our mothers.  But most of us lose our mothers in death before we ourselves die, and Mother’s Day may be a poignant reminder of someone who is now missing in our life.  There are those among us for whom the memories of our mother may be a shadowy vagueness at best.  At worst, these memories may be filled with deep sadness, or sometimes even with terror and hate.  For some among us, Mother’s Day is experienced as awkward or downright painful.   We do well not to generalize about this tender day, least of all here in the faith community.\\n\\n\\tTo complicate things even more on Mother’s Day, there are a wide variety of experiences related to being or not being a mother.   Joy and grief, missed opportunities and unwanted responsibilities, accomplishment and failure, sin and forgiveness.  Regret, surprise, hope.   It’s all intricately connected to human love and relationship: trying to love, failing to love, being loved, feeling loved, feeling unloved.  We claim as Christians that God is love.  “Love one another, as I have loved you,” commanded Jesus of his followers.  Given this complicated context of Mother’s Day, what more might we understand about love?  \\n\\n\\tIn these final words to his followers at the Last Supper, Jesus has just used the vineyard metaphor to describe the organic unity between God, Jesus and the community of faith.  God’s loving actions, like an attentive gardener, prune and shape us.  As the branches on the vine, our leafy tendrils draw their sustenance from Jesus, the central branch, which is, grounded in God the creator.  “Abide in me,” says Jesus; and in the following verses, “abide in my love.”   Back and forth the imagery is woven, “abide in me,” “my words abide in you,” “keep my commandments and abide in my love,” all pointing towards the purpose of the vine.  The vine exists for the bearing of fruit, the works of love that become the mark of faithful community. “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you,” says Jesus.\\n\\n\\tThis is mysterious language, symbolic of an unseen reality that permeates who we are as followers of Jesus and as those who try to love other humans.   Well along now in of my imperfect life of pastoring and also being a mother, sometimes I get the “love one another” thing right, and sometimes I don’t.  But this symbolic language of an unseen reality has come to make sense to me:  God and the spirit of the Risen Jesus, making their home, abiding with us, in us.  The idea here is that they take up residence in us, dwell in us, as we love Jesus and follow his commandments.  I find this to be both an awesome idea and also somewhat preposterous:  You and I are the home, homes essentially, of the Creator of the Universe.  I don’t take this to mean we are God’s only home; what is suggested here is simply that God and the Risen Jesus take up residence in us.  How are we to make sense of this?  And what difference might this make in our human relationships? \\n\\n\\t A few years ago, my sister-in-law sent out a Mother’s Day email from her home in Pittsburg, to all of us Swallow women.  She urged us to visit a website she had been tracking, which followed the nesting habits of two peregrine falcon females in the tall buildings of downtown Pittsburg, PA where she lives.  Live-streaming web cams had been placed above each of the two nests and were capturing all the mothering action!  “Check this out,” wrote Laura, “I look in on these two Mama birds several times a day and I’m rooting for them. Happy Mother’s day!” Of course, I quickly logged on to the web site, and watched in fascination while a group of 5 tiny chicks were rolling around on top of each other, live, impatiently waiting for the return of their mama bird. Then switching to the Gulf Tower at the U of Pittsburg, I witnessed the second mother hunkered down over her unhatched eggs, visibly shivering in the blustery wind.  Traffic sounds bristled through the microphones.  I checked back in on the five chicks.  Mom had now returned, and they were all making a quite racket as she bustled around the nest stuffing food into their gaping mouths.  After drastic decline in the 1960’s, a result of environmental toxins and loss of habitat, these falcons were again making their home among us, were reproducing and mothering.  \\n\\n\\tThinking about these beautiful and powerful peregrine falcons who had almost disappeared, I reflected on how sometimes we get to a point where our sense of connection with the love of the living God almost disappears, even dies.  Perhaps this has happened to you at some time in your life, or maybe even now.  That place, that nest within that held a sense of God compassionate presence seems to have fallen into disrepair, or it has simply shattered in our hearts.  We may find it gets harder to be to have compassion on ourselves.  We may get a little more critical, resentful of others.  Maybe we can’t even imagine God finding a home in us anymore, abiding, nesting within us.  Or maybe it seems like this has never even really happened.  A home, a nest, in me, for the Creator of the Universe, for the Spirit of the Risen Jesus?   Inspired by the best of mother love, is this the way we might learn how to be more loving with one another?  Might a form of obedience to God be daring to let God find a home in us?\\t\\n\\nOne of my teachers in seminary (Henry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest and theologian) spoke about how we can “slowly build a little nest” of openness for God inside of us, through the practices of prayer.  It’s as though the words of simple prayer, even a slowly repeated short phrase during our daily round, such as “O God, I need you,” or “Jesus, have mercy on me,” or “Dear Lord, thank-you,” build a nest within our hearts.  Or as the contemporary writer Anne Lamont suggests, keep it simple with prayers like “Wow.”  “Help!”  “Thanks.”  These daily, simple prayers “slowly build a little nest for themselves in our heart and stay there for the rest of our busy day,” says Nouwen.  Even while we are talking, working, driving, cooking dinner, these short prayers “can continue in our heart and keep us aware of God’s ever-present guidance” (Nouwen, The Way of the Heart, p. 82).\\n\\nMaybe this is how we learn to love God:  slowly, obediently building this nest inside, stick by twig, fiber by feather, prayer by prayer.  A place where God might abide. A nest to receive the living presence of God who so wants to make a loving home within us.  God deeply longs to settle in the nest of our hearts and create the new within us. I believe this is how we become more able to love the humans in our lives.  God is the loving nesting One in our midst.  That is the Good News for Mother’s Day.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.      \\t',\n",
       " '\\t  We are not really sure who these two people are, headed towards a village on the outskirts of Jerusalem.  Luke refers to them as disciples returning to their hometown of Emmaus.  One is identified as Cleopas; the other person is not named.  It’s Easter day, news has already spread that several of the women disciples have discovered the empty tomb, but the rest of Jesus followers apparently don’t know quite what to make of this information.  Probably stunned and exhausted, disappointed and grieving, these two are headed back home to regroup.  Recent Biblical scholars have speculated that the pair may well have been a man and his wife, the man being named, as was the custom of the time in this patriarchal culture, and the woman remaining nameless.  They do afterall, eventually end up in a commonly shared home.  Well, maybe it’s two men living together.  We aren’t sure.  \\n\\tAs the scene opens, we find these two trudging along what would have been a public Roman-built road.  About 12 feet wide, these roads were well-traveled and allowed for walking two or three abreast.  Our translation says that they are “talking and discussing with each other about all these things that had happened.”   The original Greek is a bit more edgy:  this is an emotional dialogue, a “concussive exchange of words” notes one commentator.  Not an intellectual debate, but an exasperated and intense exchange between two unraveled and overwhelmed close followers of Jesus. They have clearly witnessed the final days of Jesus life, his arrest, this death, and these strange reports by a few disciples that he had been seen earlier that day.  “How did this happen?!  I can’t believe he is dead.  He was supposed to be the one to save Israel….from those oppressive Romans!   Damn, I told him not to keep pressing his message in Jerusalem.  Yeah, it’s like he walked into the jaws of death, so reckless with his message of God’s unlimited love and acceptance of everyone!”   I imagine they are confused, dejected…. and wondering how they will pick of the pieces of their lives again.  At some point, an unfamiliar man starts to walk with them, questioning them about these reported “events” of the last week in Jerusalem.  And this really seems to tick-off our two travelers, who reply with exasperation and even anger:  “Are you the only one who doesn’t know what’s going on?”……..  \\n\\t“What things,” the stranger asks calmly. “what things?” they exclaim.  And then they give it to him…they pour out the whole wonderful and terrible story, complete with a dismissive comment about the women’s testimony being like the “babbling delerium of sick people.”  I can just see Jesus, still unrecognized at this point, quietly listening, nodding with a gentle detached interest….allowing them to pour out the whole painful tale.  \\n\\tNotice that the stranger does not immediately self-reveal.  Not unlike a close friend, a family member, a colleague, someone who knows how to hold still, not make it about themselves and really listen.  And in doing so, the stranger helps the distraught travelers untangle themselves.  A contemporary commentator notes on this passage;  “Luke uses this setting, two disciples engrossed in a conversation while they walk, as one of the contexts for Jesus’ resurrection. Most often, we think of resurrection as the flash of God’s triumph over death dealing powers. And yet Luke gives us a different aspect of this resurrection event, which is less ‘flash’ of light and more the gentle probing of our heart’s entanglements on the road to our next chapter.”  http://www.workingpreacher.org/preaching.aspx?commentary_id=3234\\n\\tIn what ways are our hearts entangled these days, I wonder?   For many of us, we have felt entangled, snarled-up and unsure of our next chapter for months now.  Many of us are trying to figure out how we move forward in hostile political climate, and an unpredictable and increasingly threatening world.  We see elected leadership challenging our basic Biblical values of justice for the poor and marginalized, welcome of the stranger and sojourner among us.  In response, as individuals and as a congregation, our best efforts feel scattershot, as we bounce like a pinball machine from confronting threats to our environment, to reproductive health, to criminal justice reform, to the rights and safety of the LGBTQ community, of immigrants, of refugees, on and on.  We get in those same kind of emotionally charged debates, “concussive exchanges of words,” even with friends who share our prospectives about life together as communities and as a country!  We become exhausted with our hearts’ entanglements, not unlike those two companions on the road to Emmaus.  \\n\\tAfter the stranger listens to their pouring out of all that has happened, he replies with what seem to be harsh words:  “Oh how foolish you are!”  Gee, thanks for the support, Jesus.  Give us a break.  We’re just grieving your DEATH here.”  But apparently, the Greek is more accurately translated “you sweet dumbies, how could you miss this?”  And the still unrecognized Jesus goes on to talk about how the  suffering, the self-sacrifice, of the Messiah was prophesized in the Hebrew scriptures.  He reminds them of their Biblical history, Moses bringing their enslaved people out of Egypt, God’s gift of law revealed in the desert wanderings and making of them a people, the call of the problems back to the principles of mercy, love and justice revealed in living that holy law.  The two compansions seem intrigued, but they still don’t know who this person is talking with them. \\n\\tThey invite him to stay with them and share an evening meal.   Can you imagine actually doing this, having struck up a conversation with someone while walking down Garden Avenue, or on the Blue Line of the lightrail, or in the produce section of Cub foods?  The extending of hospitality to strangers was a central part of Jewish, and all middle-eastern, tradition; to provide food and lodging for a stranger, for a nomadic people in harsh climates, was a matter of life and death.  It also came out of the Jews own experience of being enslaved in Egypt; “their response of gratitude to God took the form of treating others with hospitality, just as God had treated them.” (p. 46, Sharing Food: Christian Practices for Enjoyment, L. Shannon Jung).  And it is in this sharing of food together, that suddenly they recognize who he is.  It’s Jesus, hanging out in their home, sharing a meal with them.  With them, still.  Even as he suddenly disappears from their sight, with them still, gently probing of their heart’s entanglements, as they figure out what to do next with their lives.\\n\\t What I find so compelling about this story is that something happens to these their ability to recognize the risen Jesus in the midst of their extending hospitality.  While they are partaking of the meal, the stranger “takes bread, blesses it, breaks it, and gives it to them.”  Can you hear the echo of the Last Supper, Jesus taking bread and blessing it and breaking it and giving it to his followers?  As the stranger does this, immediately the disciples recognize that it is their teacher and Lord, it is the risen Messiah, the risen Christ.   And bam!  He disappears.  \\n\\tThere is hope for my heart’s entanglements as I consider my next chapter, and perhaps as you consider yours as a congregation.  We are going to encounter the living Jesus when we invite strange people into the intimate places in our lives:  into deeper conversation, into food fellowship with each other.   People who are different from us, whose cultural background, sense of gender identity or sexual orientation, personal values or religious beliefs seem foreign to us.  \\n\\tThis is the work of the church in the years ahead, in the next chapter of life together as progressive Christians.  And it will continue to be counter-cultural work, when a predominant society tells us to be afraid of the stranger, to extablish restrictions and build walls against those who seek refuge and new hope among us.   Our Outreach Ministry Team meets this Wednesday evening to continue our discussion of just how we do this more fully as a congregation.  Come join us at 6:30 and be part of the conversation!  What might it mean to carefully explore extending hospitality and safety to immigrant and refugee families?  To those facing deportation?  During the previous administration in Washington, over “Two and a half million people were deported and thousands of families were separated, while the authorities employed rhetoric designed to criminalize immigrants.”  With recent executive orders, the situation is becoming more dire.  What does hospitality to the stranger look like now?  Do we explore what it might mean to be a support to those congregations who have already proclaimed themselves as sanctuaries?  How might the stranger became more recognizable to us; how might a deeper connection lift the blindness from our eyes, and loosen the entanglements of our hearts?   Questions for our next chapter.  May we be guided by the spirit of the risen Jesus in our midst.  Amen.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuke 24:13-35 (NRSV)\\n\\n13\\xa0Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles[a]\\xa0from Jerusalem,\\xa014\\xa0and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.\\xa015\\xa0While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them,\\xa016\\xa0but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.\\xa017\\xa0And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad.[b]\\xa018\\xa0Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?”\\xa019\\xa0He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth,[c]\\xa0who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,\\xa020\\xa0and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.\\xa021\\xa0But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.[d]\\xa0Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place.\\xa022\\xa0Moreover, some women of our group astounded us.

       " '\\tWe have moved into the Season of Epiphany, where our Biblical texts focus on the “epiphany,” the revealing, or the manifestation, of Jesus to the world.  Last week: the scene with the Magi, the wisemen who arrive at the manger in Bethlehem.   The unlikely outsiders in the Birth narratives, reminding us that Jesus has come not just for an inside group, but for the whole world.  The chorus of the carol “We Three Kings” echoes through my mind as we leave this final scene of the Christmas story. “Westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light.”  And today, the leading by Christ’s light made visible among us: The Transition Committee who guided Emmaus through Rev. Bill’s departure, a whole parade of visiting ministers through the summer and the selection of interim leadership, now passing the torch onto the Discovery Team.  And they will now be light bearers among us during this time between before the Pastoral Search Committee for the settled minister is established.  The Discovery Team’s job will be to help us illumine and see more clearly the history and traditions, shared values and assumptions of your life together as a congregation.  Who have you been as Emmaus Church?  Who are you now?  What might be calling you to be in the future?  What kind of pastoral leadership will you need to help you fulfill this vision?  \\n\\tThis rhythm of remembering and moving ahead will reverberate through the months ahead here at Emmaus, as we see what the Light of Christ in our midst reveals to us.\\tBecause any visioning process about the future has much to do with memory, and how our memories sit within us.  This is true with individuals and also with church communities.  The Discovery Team will encourage you to do some remembering, perhaps in asking:  think back to some times when Emmaus was at its best.  Were there times when this was not true? What do you celebrate; which memories  weigh you down with frustration, sorrow, regret?   Do some of these communal memories make you long for the past, fear for the future?  Are they sources of encouragement?  How might memories about Emmaus help us better engage God’s future together?\\nI have wondered what Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan meant to him as he moved through his brief three years of public ministry.  John the Baptist invited fellow Jews of his day to step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly pushed Jesus to do this.  Here he is suddenly emerging from an obscure youth and young adulthood, and aligning himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  Later church doctrine will insist that Jesus was without sin.  But did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually “dry” himself?   Did he feel a desire to turn his life around, to quench some deeper thirst in those river water? Jesus was apparently well-read in Hebrew scripture; did this bapatism memory weave with his recollection of the ancient prophet Isaiah, who persistently reminds the Israelites of God’s tender love for them?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  In his baptism,  Jesus was affirmed as being worthy, loved and intimately connected to God, as he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”   \\nIt seems only natural that Jesus would spent much of his ministry reminding people that God found them worthy and beloved.  Yet for all our talk about encouraging high self-esteem and feeling good about ourselves, many of us who follow Jesus have a tough time with this concept.  We seem to fall on one side of the fence of the other:  We either under-estimate our value and worth as a human being, or we over-estimate it.  We constantly cut ourself down and feel less-than everyone else.  Or we move in a grandiose bubble where we are better than others, with little insight into our own fallibility, our limits, of where and how we might need to change.  Oblivious to the fact that we might be dependent on others or on God.  \\nStories down through the ages are filled with characters that see themselves as unworthy, unredeemable and unlovable, contrasted with those who strut their supposedly power and perfection. The fictional main character Jean ValJJOHNJean has become familiar to most of us through movies and stage productions, even if we haven’t actually waded through Victor Hugo’s 19th century French novel Les Miserables.  Here is someone who felt unredeemable to his core.  I have always found the scene where Jean ValJean is released from prison to be particularly riveting.  This lowly commoner had spent 19 years in the pre-Revolutionary French “galleys” as the prison colonies were called.  He was ordered to serve 5 years for having broken a pane of storefront glass and stealing a loaf of bread.  Added to this term were 14 more for 4 escape attempts.  He was a tree-pruner who fell on hard times; but by the time he is released from prison,  ValJean (John) has lost his connections with his previous life, and even his name.  Now convict #24,601, he has self-protectively retreated within himself.  “From year to year,” wrote Victor Hugo, “this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal sureness.  When the heart is dry, the eye is dry,” the author continued.  “On his departure from the galleys it had been 19 years since he had shed a tear.”  “When the heart is dry, the eye is dry….”\\n\\tValJean’s dry heart is exposed early in the story, through yet another act of thievery just after he gets out of prison.  The act appears congruent with the person he has become; someone possessed by a “dry heart.”  As I read this passage from the Book of Isaiah this week, I thought about what it is like to experience a dry heart.  To be stuck with a heart that feels so dry, parched, and rigid that we can’t seem to change our self-perceptions or our actions.  Surely those Israelites exiled in Babylon for so many years, experienced such dryness of heart, a feeling of having cried all your tears and being reduced to a dehydrated numbness within.  The prophet Isaiah tenderly reminds them of how they have been created, formed and redeemed by God. They are beloved, precious in God’s sight.\\n\\tIn Victor Hugo’s story, Jean ValJean is newly released from prison, wandering in a daze, and finally stumbls upon the home of a kindly Bishop and his sister.  They kindly give him a meal and a place to sleep for the night, but ValJean decides to steal from them. Taking some silver candlesticks, he escapes over the garden wall.  The next morning he is caught, and dragged back to the Bishop’s home by the police.  When confronted with the thief, the Bishop slyly inquires of his sister: \"was that silver ours?\"  His sister is stupefied by his question.  The Bishop continues: “I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently.\"  Speaking now to the policemen, the Bishop asks innocently: \"And he told you, that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? It is a mistake.\"\\n\\tThe police let him go. Jean Valjean is confused, and wary… \"My friend,\" resumed the Bishop, \"before you go, here are your candlesticks. Take them.\"\\n“What?” Jean Valjean is totally bewildered.  \"Now,\" says the Bishop, \"go in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night.\" The Bishop draws near to him, and says in a low voice: \"And Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man.\" Jean Valjean, who has no recollection of ever having promised anything, remains speechless. The Bishop continues in a grave whisper:  \"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.\"\\n\\t“You no longer belong to evil, but to good.”  It takes many years for this reality to sink-in for Hugo’s character.  How do we allow this message to really sink into us, as individuals and as a congregation?  We are accountable for but we don’t belong to the mistakes of our past.  We do not belong to our failures nor do we belong to the wounds received from others.  We belong to good because we belong to God.  We are God’s beloved sons and daughters, created this way as humans and reborn into Christ through baptism.  This is the Good News.  And beyond all of us, who else in the community needs to hear this message?   Absorbing this reality ourselves, and sharing it with others; this is the work of the church.  Remembering and moving on…..Some things to explore together in this Discovery time.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\t“In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places,” says Jesus in today’s scripture reading.  Many mansions, many rooms.   How are we to understand these words?  And how might this image of “God’s house” guide our sense of purpose as a congregation?   This passage from the Gospel of John is filled with seemingly exclusionary words that can tend to send open-minded Christians teeth on edge:  “I am the way, and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.”   Sounds like those people down in Room 8 in heaven:  all about separating out true from false believers, who is “in/saved” and who is “out/unsaved,” and who will be lifted up in the end times and who will be left behind.  Some of you left churches like that, in your yearning for a more tolerant, inclusive, welcoming community of Jesus’ followers.  Now that you are here, how does this passage help us better live into the church you want to be together?  I invite us to move between this passage and your current Vision and Mission statement that you will find printed on the back of the worship bulletin.  How does this first century writing connect with this 21st century purpose statement you have recently discerned together? \\n\\tWe know the context for the statements in the bulletin: They come out of \\n2 ½ years of our intentional interim time, lots of small group meetings exploring the joys and challenges of your history, identifying your core values and shared beliefs, expectations of your new pastor.  Taking a good, hard look at how the mission field has changed around you in the community and the world since this church was founded 75 years ago.  Opening your hearts and intutions to the Spirit’s guidance as your good brains pondered future possibilies.  But the context for this Biblical passage is a bit more obscure.  Taking these words out of context, we can easily mis-interpret Jesus’ intent, and turn them into exclusionary claims that demean other religions.  The Gospel writer John writes his Gospel to his particular Asia Minor communities filled with both Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians, around 100 CE.  This is well after those who knew Jesus had died, after stories of his teachings and works of healing had circulated for about 7 decades, and Mark, Matthew and Luke had long finished and circulated their Gospel accounts.  John imaginatively sets this conversation between Jesus and his friends and students in the upper room in Jerusalem, right before Jesus gets arrested.  The writer John is not concerned about historical timelines, verifiable facts.  He uses symbol and metaphor to introduce us to the cosmic Risen Jesus who existed before time and whom John and his community were experiencing intimately in their own time and setting.   These are words spoken to Jesus’ disciples then, and to John’s community in the beginning of the 2nd century.\\n\\tJohn sets these teachings in the context of the Passover meal Jesus shared with his disciples and other followers on the night he was arrested.  In a scene only recorded in John’s Gospel, Jesus has just finished washing each of the disciples feet to illustrate what he means by being a servant of all.  The men and women in the room are confused, and insist they should wash his feet.  Jesus assures them that when they receive, minister to, those in need, they will be receiving both Jesus and the God who has sent him.  And then Jesus indicates that one of them will betray him!  As they sit in shock, Jesus goes on to say that he himself will be leaving them.  As if that wasn’t distressing enough, Jesus then sadly tells Peter that Peter would also betray him, not once but three times.  \\n\\tImagine how these close followers are feeling at this point.  Hearing and observing all this, I would not have been able to finish my dinner.  The men and women around the table are now reeling with confusion and dawning grief – he’s going to get killed; how can we talk him out of this? – they listen incredulously as Jesus seeks to comfort and encourage them:   “Do not let your hearts be troubled,” he reassures them.  “Believe in God, believe also in me.”  Our 21st century brains get all caught up in the “believe” word – and wonder about what is the right belief, and then get indignant when someone tells us their version of the correct belief about God and Jesus!  But Jesus was never hung up on people’s beliefs about him.   Think of belief not as a set of ideas, but as a posture of trust.  “Trust in God, trust also in me.”  Notice now how Jesus moves on to this unusual image:  “In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places (In my house are many mansions), I go and prepare a place for you.”  Thomas pipes up in a panic, “what are you talking about? Where are you going?  How can we know the way?”  And isn’t that like many of us?  Just give me some directions here, some steps I can follow to successful living, some certainty, a map for God’s sake, so I can figure all of this out!  And here is the context for the “I am the way, the truth, the life, no one comes to the Father but through me.”  Jesus is speaking directly to Thomas: the way is me.  I am right in front of you.   In a mysterious way that you cannot understand right now, I will always be right in front of you…and beside you and within you and ahead of you.  “If you know me, you will know my Father also.  From now on you do know God and have seen God.”  For the disciples, and for us, this is somewhat mind-boggeling.  Give us a plan, some defined steps on how to live a Christian life, Jesus.  Philip goes on to demand, “come on Jesus, show us God!”  I want Clarity, verifiable certainty!  Nooooo.  “If you have seen, experienced me, says Jesus, you have experienced the heart of God.”  He gives them, us, a on-going relationship, filled with confusion and mystery and challenge.  Through his living presence among us now, It is a relationship in which we are invited to grow, to be transformed through each day of our lives.  I am the way, the truth and the life.  Right before you, right now. \\n\\tAs we dive deeper into your Vision and Mission statement that we discerned together during this intentional interim period, I am struck with how you have embraced that relational language…..perhaps unintentionally!   I have not known this to be a congregation where discussion of one’s “personal relationship with Jesus” is very common.  I don’t overhear you approaching one another in coffee hour asking, “so, how’s it been going with you and God this week?”  which is actually a quick way to move beyond superficial “how about those Twins” exchanges!  We shy away from this language, perhaps concerned that the question is too fundy sounding, or too intimate to ask of one another.  And yet……here is this relational language about transformative love in your Vision statement.  We hope to become seekers and servants growing in God’s transforming love.  And I would say this relational sense unfolds even more dramatically through your Mission statement.\\n\\tAs you read the Mission Statement on the back of your worship bulletin:  notice that first paragraph:  you boldly seek to “become a demonstration plot for the reign of God on earth” – whoa!   You wonderfully presumumptive people!  Do you catch the reference to the U of MN Ag School right down the road?   It was your previous pastor Norm Broadbent who introduced this agricultural language among you some years ago.   For over 100 years, demonstration plots have been used at university research stations to explore and demonstrate “successful farming methods…. for the purpose of using the university’s “educational resources to inform and improve the quality of life” of the whole community.   The demonstration plots are ways to figure out if the new soil and crop management techniques are going to work.  You experiment with a manageable plot size and see what happens….in doing so, you take a public risk.  And I suppose we could say, that whether you succeed or fail, this information is important for farmers, food producers to know.  The demonstrations are “considered an appropriate means of disseminating the useful and practical information generated by the university.”  © Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement, Volume 11, Number 4, p. 55, (2006) \\nWhatever is learned is for the good of the wider community.\\n\\tWe are in a time in world history, and American society in general, when we are having to learn to “do church” in a new way.   Our surrounding community has changed so drastically since the heydays of the post-World War II church boom, that many congregations are being left in the dust.  Scared of displeasing their existing but dwindling current membership, congregations resist trying new ways of engaging spiritually hungry people.  They aren’t willing, for various reasons, to envision themselves as a demonstration plot where God’s reign of mercy, peace and justice can grow in new ways.  It just feels too risky, too public…wonder if we fail, have no money left for a rainy day, they ask themselves.  \\n\\tNot so Falcon Heights Church!  And I tell you, this is one of the reasons it is going to be really hard for me to stop being your Pastor!  Your willingness over the last 2 ½ years to try new ways of communicating with one another, new ways of worshiping and serving together, of opening up to the needs of the surrounding community, has been quite something.  You are allowing yourselves to be tended by the Master Garden, the spirit of the living Jesus.  You are becoming a demonstration plot where risks are taken, the public is more openly invited in, and the soil that is each of you is getting re-vitalized.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\t  \\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe riskiness of being a demonstration plot:\\nIt might not work AND it is public.  \\nPride Picnic – maybe no one comes.  Or thinks you are the gay church.\\nI start talking about my problems with imagining God or about praying, and \\tpeople might look at me weird.\\n\\nOr as Walter Brueggeman, the describes it, “there will be no safe place and we can’t look back to previous loyalities.”  (Brueggman blog, Sojourners).  \\n\\n(Olivet 6.2010)\\nWhat we might notice is this invitation to stay focused.  It is easy to space-out in time of transition.  It’s natural to get distracted and not pay attention to what is happening in our midst, be it someone dying or someone leaving.  Perhaps this is because such transitions can are sad and unsettling.  It is difficult to trust that God is at work in the transition and the loss that comes will come with it.  Well, it may be somewhat understandable that a pastor has to finally, at some point, retire, but why on earth can’t the interim pastor stick around? \\n\\nIn conversation with various Olivetians since I have announced my August departure as your interim, I have heard wonderings and concerns about the new pastor.  Will it be a good match with who we are as a church?  Will I like him or her, be able to relate to her sermons or his pastoral care or vision?  How natural it is to get distracted by one’s own individual hopes for connection and care, and to lose track of the wider issues for God’s church at Olivet.  It is not a new pastor you will follow; it will be Jesus you will follow.  Yes, we may pray that the new person, whoever he or she is, will be given a “double portion” of fruitfulness in their ministry at Olivet.   And when the final vote comes, the decision must not be made on: “do I like, do I prefer, this person or not?”  The criteria for choosing must be:  will this person be the one to equip and empower us to do God’s will together in the years to come? \\n\\t\\nWe speak of a passing of the mantle of pastoral authority in the church, in part because of this story Elijah passing his cloak, his symbolic mantle of prophetic ministry, on to Elisha.  Everyone has to pick up a piece of this, I think.   \\nPerhaps Elijah’s words to his student Elisha are a helpful guide:  “stay focused on me being taken from you,” he says.  This may sound like odd advice, but I sense that this is encouragement for you and me, congregation and interim pastor, to stay connected and open and honest with one another until I leave.  What worked and was helpful during our interim time together?  What could have been different?  Where did I, you, we, fall short as Jesus’ disciples together?   Send me an email, let’s have coffee together, speak with a Council member who can share your thoughts at my final exit interview with the Council as your leadership body.  \\n\\nFinally, all this staying focused on what is happening in this moment, is what will finally move this congregation forward.  Showing up for one another in worship, engaging each other in fellowship and service, praying fiercely for one another and the Pastoral Search Committee when we are apart.  These are the parts of leadership, parts of the mantle, that everyone needs to pick up this summer.  Palestinian plows were both light and notoriously wobbly.  If the farmer did not keep one hand firmly on the plow, the other hand holding the reigns of the unruly oxen, and both eyes focused on the path ahead, the furrow would quickly become crooked.  Crooked furrows make for inefficient farming and a waste of energy.   And so we are called to a unique kind of concentration and constancy in the days ahead.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/carlgregg/2011/05/lectionary-commentary-%E2%80%9Ca-progressive-christian-reading-of-john-146%E2%80%9D-for-sunday-may-22-2011/\\nGradually, I began to understand John 14:6 in a new light.\\xa0 I started to see it as an important\\xa0intra-Christian statement (a statement by Christians and for Christians), which is how I see the text today.\\xa0\\xa0I still don’t think the statement has much importance for\\xa0inter-religious dialogue — that is, between different religions — but I do think it is important for internal Christian self-understanding.\\xa0Accordingly, the Christian theologian Wesley Ariarajah writes that,\\nWhen my daughter tells me I’m the best daddy in the world, and there can be no other father like me, she is speaking the truth, for this comes out of her experience. She is honest about it; she knows no other person in the role of her father. But of course it is not true in another sense. For one thing, I myself know friends who, I think, are better fathers than I am. Even more importantly, one should be aware that in the next house there is another little girl who also thinks her daddy is the best father in the world. And she too is right. In fact as the level of the way the two children relate to their two fathers, no one can compare the truth content of the statements of the two girls. For here we are not dealing with the absolute truths, but with the language of faith and love. …\\nThe language of the Bible is also the language of faith….The problem begins when we take these confessions in the language of faith and love and turn them into absolute truths. It becomes much more serious when we turn them into truths on the basis of which we begin to measure the truth or otherwise of other faith claims. My daughter cannot say to her little friend in the next house that there is no way she can have the best father, for the best one is right there in her house. If she does, we’ll have to dismiss it as child-talk!\\n\\n2\\xa0“When my daughter tells me I’m the best daddy in the world….”\\xa0Wesley Ariarajah,\\xa0\\xa0(Orbis, 1989), 23.\\n\\n\\nThis insight brings me back to Thomas’ question and Jesus’ answer.\\xa0 Jesus begins chapter 14 by saying, “Do not let your hearts be troubled.”\\xa0 He then proceeds to describe God’s big house with many rooms (God’s “big tent,” if you will).\\xa0 But Thomas’ heart is troubled.\\xa0 He’s worried and concerned about all this talk of Jesus going away.\\xa0 So he asked that fateful question, “How can we know the way?”\\xa0\\xa0Jesus’ statement about being the way, the truth, and the life is a response to a question\\xa0by\\xa0Christians, and Jesus’ answer is directed\\xa0to\\xa0Christians and is\\xa0about\\xa0Christians.\\xa0Of course, Jesus’ followers wouldn’t have called themselves to “Christians” yet; but, as we learn in the book of Acts, “The Way” was one of the earliest names for Christianity.\\nPart of what Jesus was doing was offering comfort to Thomas: “Don’t worry, Thomas.\\xa0 You know me. When I’m gone, just continue to ‘do the works that I do.’ Follow the path I have set forth with my life, and you’ll be following the way.”\\xa0 So perhaps I wasn’t so wrong all those years ago to find comfort in John 14.\\xa0But Jesus’ instruction doesn’t end there.\\xa0 Included in Jesus’ pastoral assurance is the challenge to keep on following the way of Jesus even when it’s difficult.\\xa0 The best summation I’ve seen of this perspective is by the pastor, writer, and spiritual director Eugene Peterson.\\xa0 Peterson encapsulates Jesus’ point in John 14 by saying,\\xa0“Only when we do the Jesus truth in the Jesus way do we get the Jesus life.”\\xa0Isolating only the so-called “Jesus truth” yields a disembodied orthodoxy: all the right words with no behavior to make the words believable.\\xa0 More important is the “Jesus Way” of loving God and loving neighbor.\\nConclusion\\nI’m no longer haunted by the idea that John 14:6 means that Christianity is the only way to salvation.\\xa0 In my experience,\\xa0the claim that Christianity holds sufficient truth for salvation does not mean that it has to hold that truth exclusively.\\xa0This revelation became particularly real for me when I realized, for example, that\\xa0Mohatma Ghandhi (a Hindu) and Thich Nhat Hanh (a Buddhist) come closer to the Jesus truth, the Jesus way, and the Jesus life than most of the Christians I know, including myself.\\nAs I have continued to wrestle with the reality of religious pluralism, I have found the following two short sayings helpful.\\xa0 First, theologian Huston Smith says that God is “defined by Jesus, not confined to Jesus.”\\xa0Second, Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong has said, “I walk the Christ-path into the mystery of God, but I do not believe that God is a Christian.”\\xa0The common core to both of these slogans is that one can affirm the validity of other religious traditions without abandoning Christianity.\\nWhat haunts me now is not whether faithful Hindus, Muslims, and Jews are saved.\\xa0 Even if this were a concern, there’s too much wonderful, beautiful, and challenging involved with being a Christian to worry too much about everyone else’s religion.\\xa0 Today the questions I ask myself today are:\\nAm I living the Jesus truth?\\nAm I living the Jesus way?\\n\\nJesus, the Master Gardener\\nPosted on\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWell, you learn something new everyday.\\nI bought a big hanging basket of petunias, and some individual ones to plant too. They are the large kind (note my amazing knowledge of plant strains), big petals of shocking pink, white and red. They were growing like crazy, and looked great.\\nUntil we got back from our trip out west that is. I came home to a sorry, straggly basket. The individual plants were overgrown and tilted to the ground. Yikes! What happened here in just one week?\\nYes, it did rain a lot. But I couldn’t believe the change. I decided to watch a few youtube videos about the flower. Ohhhh. I didn’t know I was supposed to ‘deadhead’ the wilted flowers. I would occasionally pull off the dead blooms, but that wasn’t good enough.\\n One gardener showed me how to do it the right way. Under the petals I had pulled, lies a seed. You can see the start of it in the photo here (arrow). Every bloom will fall, and leave a seed like this. If it isn’t removed, it will grow, drop and start a new plant. Which is fine. But if my petunia thinks it’s made enough seeds, it will just quit flowering.\\nThe whole growing cycle of the plant is aimed at making that seed. Make enough? The job is done. Over and out.\\nThe solution for keeping the plant flowering is to remove all those seeds. Then it will keep going all summer.\\nAs I stood in the front yard, snipping away at the blooms in the basket, I thought about how God would never want me to think that my ‘growing cycle’ was done.\\nPerforming a work of mercy, or offering a word of consolation causes my soul to bloom. Each small act of love becomes a colorful flower on the vine of my life. As God gazes at the gardens we create, He smiles, watching us beautify the earth with our loving deeds.\\nBut that’s not all we produce. Our flowers also bring forth a seed, just like my petunias. Our seeds represent the example we set to others as we love each other. But unlike my petunias, we don’t decide how many seeds we make. It’s not up to us to count them, trying to decide if we’re done with good works. Petunias do that. Not God’s children.\\nJesus, the Master Gardner, will come and collect the seeds. Like the loving and tender God He is, He scatters them to create new fields. The more good works we do, the more people we inspire; creating the seeds that allow new fields to come into being.\\n\\n\\nI never want to stop helping our God change the face of the earth.\\nI’ve cut back all my flowers, and removed the seeds. I’m hopeful that the plants will grow back again, full and lush. I’d like them to keep blooming and growing all season long. You know what? I hope I do too.\\nhttp://www.ceilryan.com/2015/08/26/jesus-the-master-gardener/',\n",
       " '\\tThe musical telling of two stories:  Noah and the Ark, Genesis 6-8.  Jonah and the Great Fish, the Book of Jonah.   Long stories, which I’ll briefly summarize to get us ready for the flow of our musical this morning.  These are ancient, Bible tales, story-myths about how God interacts in human lives.  Shocking stories, really, about human choices, God’s frustration, extreme weather, and the sailors that carry the drama.  And it’s all about  Water!  Ever-present, powerful, unpredicatable water.  The one element that existed even before God created the heavens and the earth.  Our creation story-myth begins with God’s breath moving over the waters. Heaven and earth are created as God separates these primeval waters.\\t\\n\\tCivilizations grow up around the planet, along the banks of great waters.  The river Nile in Egypt, the Ghanges in India, the Euphrates in the Fertile Cresent of the Middle East.  River waters flood the lands, and recede, and flood the lands again.  Many different religions around the work tell stories of huge floods sent by the gods or the one God.  Humans are getting too violent and not caring for one another and the land.  Humans are warned that the Creator won’t tolerate this and regrets creating these violent humans in the first place.  We’ve got to start over say the gods.  In all these stories, someone becomes God’s helper and is told to build a boat.  In our Biblical story it is Noah, his wife and his family and they build an ark, filling it with animals. The storm and floods come, and then the waters recede. God promises not to destroy creation again.  God and humans make a covenant to live in peace.\\n\\tAfter describing the story of Noah and the Ark, the “Sailor’s Bible” moves to another mythological struggle against chaos: humans against the raging sea!  A reluctant messenger named Jonah and a huge fish!   This was a tale told in the courts of Israel, after they had returned from the Babylonian exile and were growing in prosperity.  The political and social elite were getting rich….and smug.  Their religious views were narrowing, they were becoming more exclusive and ignoring those on the margins, and the strangers among them.  God is not pleased.  The prophetic story-teller weaves a satirical tale, not unlike a Saturday Night Live skit:  God calls Jonah to go to the non-Jewish town of Ninevah – huge prosperous, smug metropolis of Assyria, not unlike Jerusalem - to warn them of God’s displeasure.  A foreign city that looks a lot like us, the listeners would realize!  Jonah says, “no way, I’m running away from God and heading in the other direction!”  He jumps on a boat headed to Tarshish, the non-Jewish saliors hear he is trying to flee his God and they go nuts.  “What?  We know you can’t run from God, and we don’t even believe in your God!”  A big storm whips up, the sailors realize that Jonah may be the cause and toss him overboard.  The storm stops!  The Gentile sailors fall on their knees and worship Jonah’s God.  Meanwhile, Jonah gets swallowed by a huge fish, a whale of a fish and sits in its stinky stomach and sulks.  Jonah argues with God; Jonah doesn’t like the idea that people outside of his religion should get God’s attention and compassion.  The whale is so disgusted he spits Jonah out.  Jonah finally agrees to go warn Ninevah, the city changes their evil ways and God decides not to destroy them.  And Jonah realizes:  those far off, foreigeners, may be closer to God than you think.  God loves and cares for all humans.\\n\\tAs the sailors in our play will show to us, “God stays with us through every storm until the journey’s end.  This is my promise,” says God, “as wide as the sky, stronger than thunder and deep as the sea, that speaks to the hunger in every heart’s cry: You are my children and you belong to me.”',\n",
       " '\\tHoly Week, the week before Easter, is all about big and awful things that happen to Jesus in Jerusalem.  But we’re not quite to Jerusalem as the scripture text begins this morning.  And this may seem a bit unusual for a Palm Sunday message.  Bring on the swaying palm branches, the loud Hosannas and Jesus triumphal entry into the huge city for his Big Week!   \\n\\tNo, our text today begins more quietly, the day before the Jerusalem entry. The setting is Bethany, a few miles outside of Jerusalem, near the Mt. of Olives.  We are in the home of the sisters Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus. That would be their now famous brother Lazarus, who had apparently died and then been revived by Jesus, much to the amazement of family and friends, and much to the consternation of the religious authorities.   I’ve added this family story to that of the more familiar description of Jesus entering Jerusalem because it deepens my understanding of much what is happening to Jesus at this point.  This vinette also has some rather challenging things to say about discipleship, and what it might mean for us to follow the Risen Jesus ourselves.\\n\\tThe three siblings are giving a dinner for Jesus.  Martha is serving the meal.  Other of Jesus’ followers are surely in the room, but only the disciple Judas is named specifically.   Chances are everyone is sitting or reclining around a low table, eating and drinking, relaxing and talking together.  Suddenly Mary appears at Jesus’ feet.  Had she been sitting next to him?  The text doesn’t say, but this was a crowd of men and women who were co-equals in Jesus’ eyes.  Now washing with water the hands and feet of an honored dinner guest was a common practice in those times of sandals and road dust.  But in Mary’s hands is about 12 ounces of perfumed ointment imported from the Himalayas.  Silently, she pours, and anoints Jesus’ feet and then wipes them with her hair.  The sweet fragrance of the nard fills the room, pushing against the stunned silence.  The meal forgotten, a confusing clash of images would be filling the minds of this Jewish dinner crowd: memories of their ancient kings being anointed as God’s servants; images of Jewish wives anointing their soldier husbands before sure-death in battle; visions of dead bodies being anointed and prepared for burial.  The group is struck mute by the enormity and the intimacy of this highly symbolic act….. Until Judas can resist no longer and blurts out:  “What!?  This stuff is worth more than a day laborer’s wages for a year!  Think of what that money would mean for the poor of this town?”\\n\\tWhat Mary does at this point is not made clear.  Her act exceeds any notion of hospitality, and for some in the room, exceeds good taste with its sensual and intimate connotations (Matt Skinner, workingpreach.org 2010).   Some contemporary writers claim that she and Jesus must have been sexually involved.  But my hunch,  is her closeness with Jesus goes even deeper than physical sex.  She has been following Jesus for several years now; she has sat at his feet in the mode of student, of disciple, soaking in his teachings, learning how to preach and heal just as the other disciples were doing.   Can we see here, now quietly sitting back on her heels, and listening to Judas’ accusations and scorn.  Not defending herself but holding her fellow disciple in an intense and knowing gaze.  She is an interesting contrast to Mary Magdalene, who is much more “out there” in the Gospel accounts.  Mary Magdalene “is bold and brash…witnessing and proclaiming” to the dubious/doubtful disciples that she has encountered the Risen Jesus outside the tomb on Easter morning.  But in this startling outpouring of silent devotion, Mary challenges us with her solemn receptiveness to Jesus’ unfolding reality.  Oddly enough, Jesus will have nothing to do with Judas criticism of her wastefulness.  Which is rather curious, as Jesus was always about the poor and the marginalized.  But there is something about Judas’ unyielding piety, his self-serving greediness, under the guise of helping the poor, that really irks Jesus.   It is Mary’s “contemplative attunement” to his impending suffering and death that catches Jesus’ attention and garners his praise.  \\n\\tIn the accounts of this story in several other Gospels, Jesus actually declares: “she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.  Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her” (Mark 14:8-9).   Clearly, here is an important piece of the Gospel tradition about the role of women in the early Christian community that quickly got repressed in the ensuing years.  The focus on male apostolic succession, within a wider patriarchal culture, repressed the fact that this Mary was not only one of Jesus’ most beloved disciples, but was certainly a prominent leader in the early church.“Wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”  \\n\\tBut what had she done that Jesus considered so profoundly important?  For starters, she had been listening and observing.  She had absorbed and begun to integrate into herself what Jesus had been talking about over and over:  At some deep level, she knows that surrender,  “letting go or letting be, is the gatefway to a fullness so extravagant that it fills (human) emptiness to bursting.” (Bourgeault p. 111 IBID).   She was getting it about abundant life, transformation of who we are in this present moment.  She could see that true servanthood is about a willingness to empty oneself, surrender oneself, for the sake of the other. \\n\\tIn the Gospel records, most of the male disciples struggle with this notion of the first being last and the last being first, of the call to be servants.  They would debate which of them was most important.  Jesus would talk about his impending suffering and death and they would stop him.  Perhaps out of their loving protectiveness they did not want Jesus to confront the authorities nor to move towards Jerusalem.  They were having an immensely difficult time letting Jesus be who he was.   Mary is the only one in the room willing to name what is really going on:  “Jesus, you are going to follow through, I see it now.  You are going to keep proclaiming your unsettling message that God’s favor is upon the poor and the marginalized, that God’s grace is available for all, and the way of peace is the only option. The crowds will keep gathering to hear you and our religious leaders are going to get so nervous about the wrath of the Romans.  And you are going to be considered seditious and a threat to the state, and you are going to be killed for it.”  What does she do that Jesus praises?  She gives him her wild, loving devotion in one extravagant act, and in doing so gives him her honesty.  She tells the truth about who he is and what he is doing.\\n\\tJennifer Garrison Brownell, a UCC pastor in Vancover, WA, writes in her reflections on this text that Mary “knew the end was in sight and so she did not hold back.”  Which raises the question for me about what I may “hold back” in my life.  The Vancouver pastor asks, “what would you do if you knew you had no more time” – no more time with someone you loved, no more time left walking around on this earth yourself.  What wild, extravagant act might you do that may well really tick some people off?  Mary’s act of devotion stirs up more than Judas consternation.   No one can smell or enjoy their food because the air is filled with the pungent, cloyingly sweet scene of the nard.  Feet, hands, hair all touching.  Unrelated woman touching a non-relative man.  Unseemly dinnertable behavior for sure.  But this is what she does.  And this is what Jesus praises.  And this is what the Gospel writer John wants us to know:  Judas really misses the point of this meal-time fellowship, of this act of devotion, of Jesus impending death.  Mary gets it and extravangantly enacts that knowing.  “What she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”   Perhaps true discipleship is less about rigorous discipline and more about doing that wild and extravagant thing God wants you to do with your one precious life.\\n\\tWhat did Jesus think about later, after supper, right before he went to sleep that night?  Did Mary’s extravagant action give him encouragement to do the next bold and wild thing?  The following day, Jesus engages is some rather sly street theater himself, entering the city gates of Jerusalem on a donkey. While the crowds cheer for their conquering Messiah, Jesus performs his own parody of vanquishing the Romans, with a non-military and even ridiculous looking entry on a scrappy donkey.  He will go on to flip over money changing tables in the Temple, heal on the Sabbath and speak truth to power.  This revolution was not going to happen through military might, or excluding certain people, or fencing people out. \\nMary knew Jesus was in danger; his message was subversive and it challenged those in power.  In one wild and extravagant move she anointed him before he died. Always the realist, Jesus knew it was not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  There he is, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death….even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us now; and we are asked to follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tPlanning the perfect Christmas.  I suppose this looks different for each of us.  A perfect Christmas may involve the fulfillment of certain beloved traditions: home decorated just so; Christmas cards complete; our gifts hand created or at least wrapped and sent by now, enjoying special music; baking certain recipes.  For some it is more about people: who is able to join us at the dinner table or accompany us to Christmas Eve worship, how our conversations go, the delicate balance of living in close quarters again.  Will we feel the love this year, we wonder hopefully.  Of family, of friends, of God?  For some a perfect Christmas is simply avoiding all the hubbub, maintaining a bit of a Grinch-like distance on it all, or maybe just holding our breath until January 1.   \\n\\t“American culture and media both load Christmas with false expectations,” mostly of “family harmony and good cheer.”  So writes Aaron Klink a Lutheran minister down in Durham, NC who works as a VA hospital chaplain.  His Biblical commentary on today’s passage from Matthew was a reminder to me of how the first Christmas most certainly did not follow any well-laid out plan of perfection.  “In today’s story of Mary and Joseph, God’s work often upsets comfortable social expectations and conventions….behind the pretty nativity scene lies both a wonder and a scandal,” Rev. Klink explains.  He then invites us to consider a time in our own lives when our Christmas failed to live up to some notion of “perfect.”  He wonders: Did any sense of grace, some different kind of loving or faithfulness tumble out of the failure?\\n\\tI remember being a parish young minister in my first call at Christmas time.  My church was out on the “left coast,” far away from my large and close east coast family.  The California weather was balmy, which was unnervingly strange for a New England girl.  But I worked hard to multi-task through Advent, dealing with church responsibilities in a large suburban congregation, as well as personal greetings cards, decorated tree, present production and trips to the post office.  I hauleded my youth group up to San Francisco where we served homeless people at a chaotic soup kitchen; I made them sing Christmas carols on the cable car.  And I somehow kept up the “perfect Christmas season charade” that I was fine with not joining my clan for the first time during the holidays. Until Christmas Eve.  Between the two services at my congregation, I ended up eating dinner at a local dingy chain restaurant.  Neon lights and plastic menus, surly and abrupt wait-staff, uninspired food.   This was not the Christmas Eve dinner of my heritage, thinking of my Swallow family gathered around their annual oyster feast.  The dim northern California restaurant dining room was about half full with quiet and somber looking people, many of them sitting alone.  “But it is Christmas Eve,” I thought to myself in disbelief, suddenly realizing, for the first time in my sheltered family-full life, that this was Christmas Eve for many people.   Bit people eating alone – this went against every social convention I had experienced.  Humbled, my eyes were open in a new way to the simple isolation of many people’s lives.   My understanding of ministry, of the possible role a congregation could play in lonely people’s lives, deepened that night in ways I had not anticipated.\\n\\tJoseph in today’s story certainly is confronted with a change of plans; he is actually faced with a grievous breach of social convention.  Having followed the engagement protocol of his time, Mary has yet to move into Jospeh’s home. But this engagement is not proceeding as planned; Mary is pregnant. A brief pause here to acknowledge the whole “how does she get pregnant if she is a virgin” debate.  I caution us not to make this a litmus test (“can you or can you not believe this is historically true”).  Let us boldly lay claim to our non-literal approach to scripture that we follow here at Emmaus.  What is the symbolic, the mythic, the profoundly serious intent of these stories? We have no idea where these stories came from; only Luke and Matthew introduce Jesus by focusing on the miraculous nature of his birth.  They want us to understand that God constantly intervenes and is active in human history.  They want their readers to know that this reality is both mysterious and marvelous.  That’s the serious challenge in these texts: not the virgin birth debates.  Can we really embrace the wild possibility that the Creator of the universe is intently, compassionately, mercifully interested in each of us as individuals and all of us as a whole humanity? \\n\\tI find this Joseph part of the birth narrative to be one of the most poignant scenes in the whole Christmas story.  Maybe because it’s a love story almost derailed by God’s sudden intervention.  “She was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit,” writes Matthew.  Joseph is described to be a righteous man and plans to dismiss her quietly.  Take care not to assume “coldly legalistic” when you here.  To be “righteous” in this age meant careful adherence to God’s law and consistent compassionate behavior.  Even in his horror and confusion, Joseph’s love for Mary will not permit him to publically disgrace her.  Then an angel appears to Joseph in a dream and admits that this isn’t what Joseph had expected, and that God is doing something in the midst of the mess that pushes outside all social convention.  This is Aaron Klink’s point:  “Amid all our less-than-picture-perfect Christmases….(and our) lives that are not as perfect as we want them to be, God does something new.”  God is bringing us “a human being who will somehow show us a different way to be.”  (p. 96, Feasting on the Word, Year A, Volume 1).  \\n\\tIt’s worth pondering the part where Joseph is told that this son will  “save people from their sins” as much as these words can unsettle or annoy us.  Again, I suggest we think more broadly here than being saved from an afterlife of Hell.  What seems to save us, anyway?  Given basic food and shelter, being saved certainly doesn’t happen with more possessions, we know that.  What saves us from our limited thinking, from our self-focus, our tight hold on social convention, our fear of the unknown future?   Well, it’s usually love, isn’t it?  Someone, a person maybe, keeps accepting and being present to us, loves us, through our worst of times.  Is attentive to us; paying attention.  This saves us.  Joseph gave his loving presence and attention to his betrothed, to Mary, in spite of the unknown ahead of them. It certainly saved her.  He agrees to name the child Jesus, which in Jewish society meant that you adopted the child as your own.  One might say Joseph’s practice of love saved baby Jesus too.  \\n\\tWhat saves us?  Perhaps an awareness of that most Holy Someone, infinitely mysterious and beyond our comprehension who actually sees us, attends to us; a connectedness with this God who brings us comfort, loving challenge, direction, hope when we certainly haven’t earned it.  \\n\\tErik Erickson, the 20th century developmental psychologist, wrote somewhere that an essential part of a human baby’s development is having someone look lovingly at him or her.  Erickson called it “the gaze of a delighted other.”  Gerald May, the psychiatrist and spiritual director who founded the contemplative center, Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Washington DC, explained Erickson’s insight in this way:  “Love cannot be separated from attentiveness….’the gaze of the delighted other’ ….when we love someone, we really look at them, listen to them, delight in their presence.”  (It’s a daily practice.)  Similarly, (May writes), whenever we really see someone, truly hear them, it is virtually impossible not to love them, of only just a little.” (Important to remember that in family conflict or church debate; and when we go out to serve others who seem so different from us – do I really see this person, hear this person, encounter this person as I help them!)  May concludes, “the deepest act of love is not help or service; it is immediate, attentive presence.”  Not help or service, but paying loving attention.   \\n\\tPerhaps this is at the core of the practice of love.  This attentive presence to the other, that somehow “gazes with delight” or at least a quiet openness, acceptance.  How might this change the way we do outreach and mission projects in the church?  Where our personal encounters with the other, the person in need, becomes just as important, just as loving, as the food or shelter or gifts or money that we so generously give them?  \\n\\tThe slow progression of Advent, the festival of Christmas: these will move through us like the ebb and flow of a huge tide.  Some of it will be wistfully wonderful and much of it will simply reflect our human limitations.  God simply asks that we show up for it all, that we gaze with loving attention on the humans around us.  Because love both saves us, and calls us to do strange and unconventional things, like Joseph finally welcoming a pregnant Mary and an unknown destiny into his life.  May our practice of love send us forth into God’s unfolding future.   Amen.\\n   \\n  hi\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words….\\nWe know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to (God’s) purpose. (Romans 8)\\n\\n\\tWe have just heard some words from a letter, written by one of the early ministers and teachers in the church.  After Jesus died, Paul traveled around near where Jesus lived, spreading the good news that the spirit of Jesus was still alive, bringing new life inside people and within communities.  He started a lot of churches, then he would write letters to them, encouraging them.  His church in Rome was having a hard time, and he wrote these words:  “even when you don’t know what to pray for, the God’s spirit prays inside of you.”  And, “we know that all things work together for good for those who love God.”  \\n\\n\\tNow that first part makes sense for me.  I like this idea that the Spirit is inside, deeply sighing for me, when I need help.  But that second part is a little more confusing.  All things work together for good.  You mean if something bad happens in my life, it’s a good thing?  My dog dies, or my dad gets sick or I lose my job or a friend is mean to me, that is working together for good?  Probably most of us have had this verse, or something like it, offered to us by a well-meaning person when we were in a crisis.  Something terrible has happened in our lives, in our family or in our church, and someone is trying to console us.  All things work together for good, they remind us.  Their intentions are well meaning; they are trying to help in a situation where a bad thing has happened to a good or innocent person.  It’s meant to be….God doesn’t give you more than you can handle…\\n\\n\\tBut it gets me thinking about what kind of God this might be.  A God who sits at a giant control panel in the sky, like a at big computer and planning awful things to happen in our lives.  “Here, let me send as earthquake, or make someone sick, or I’ll start a war over here,” we imagine God thinking to Godself.  I don’t think this is true.  But we live in an imperfect world, where mistakes, disasters happen and people hurt each other.  Some are big and some are small.  How do we cope with this reality? \\n\\n\\tMany years ago, when I was a young mom, I was standing by our kitchen sink preparing dinner.  “Itchy is dead!”  The sudden cry of anguish escalated as my young son hurtled down the hall.  I quickly turned from the sink as Nicholas burst into the kitchen.  Tears streaming down his cheeks, he could hardly speak.\\n\\n\\t“Nicholas, what’s wrong?” I implored with mounting panic.\\n\\n\\t“Mom!  Itchy is dead!”  Unable to identify the deceased, I hesitated.  Nicholas moaned, “my goldfish, Mom!”\\n\\n\\tThen I remembered.  A hot afternoon at the school carnival a few weeks before.  Nicholas’ triumphant face as he presented me with the water-filled plastic bag containing a tiny goldfish.  “Look what I won!  I’ve named him Itchy!”  Remembering the survival rate of goldfish from my own childhood.  Shaking my head in resignation.  Now, the inevitable had happened and my five-year old child was inconsolable.\\n\\n\\t“Oh, sweetheart,” I sighed, circling my arms around him.  He continued to sob hysterically.  Working at the time as a hospital chaplain who specialized in helping people deal with loss, I was on familiar ground.  But as my own child continued to wail, I sensed a growing impatience within me.  It was hard to listen to him cry.  I wanted to laugh out loud and protest, “it’s just a fish!”  \\n\\nSomehow I stopped myself.  I flashed on the way loss is often minimized.  “Stop your belly-aching….this isn’t a big deal!”   “It’s just a dog; just an early pregnancy that wasn’t to be; just another pastor leaving….not such a big deal,” people will often say. These words discredit the sadness, anger and confusion people experience when something or someone precious disappears.   Yet, here I felt powerless.  My son was grief stricken!  Like any good parent, I wanted to fix this.\\n\\t\\n\\t“We can get you another one” leapt to my lips.  Like, you can get a new dog, get pregnant again, get a new pastor.  But somehow I held the words back, knowing that few people are consoled by the idea of getting a replacement when a pet or human loved one dies or someone important leaves.   \\n\\t\\n\\tNicholas’ sobbing was more muffled now.  I knelt down besides him, but I was in no mood to pray.  I was feeling a bit mad at God and wondered why children have to face disappointment and hurt.  Some people feel terribly angry and abandoned by God in times of loss.  “Why did God let her die?”  “Why does God let him suffer so?”  “Why did God let our church get into such big fights?”  These are raw, tough questions that push against my understanding of fairness, the purposes of life, and of Mystery itself.  \\n\\t\\n\\tIn that moment on our kitchen floor, I wondered if God sometimes feels like this, like a parent holding a hurting child.  Does God yearn to replace the fish and make it all better?  “Where are you, God?  What are you doing?” I have demanded.  Yet, as I embraced my son, I remembered the ways God has held me during periods of chaos and grief.  I remembered when I have felt God holding me as other humans have listened to my frustrations or my sorrows.  I remembered people who have been like the Sprit, simply quietly groaning with me with sighs too deep for words.  I realized that this is how the good starts to come back into our lives.\\n\\t\\n\\tSnuffling quietly now, Nicholas asked if we could bury Itchy.  We carefully scooped the floating carcass out of the fishbowl and put it in the refrigerator so we could bury it the backyard in the morning.  I sensed that my son was already starting his grief work.  Sermonizing or attempts to distract him from his pain were not required.  He had needed my quiet listening presence and compassion.  He went to blow his nose.  I returned to the dishes in the sink, marveling at God’s unfathomable tenderness and loving restraint as Parent of us all.\\n\\t\\n\\tNow worst things have happened than a fish dying in our family.  But I realized that this instance might give me a good chance to practice working these Biblical principles.  The Spirit of God is praying for you, I reminded myself.  And God is working all things for good, even this!  It’s like starting with the small stuff if you are trying to see how God is working all things together for good.   And we are partners in making this good happen….in our presence, in our listening, in our quiet groaning for one another.  Start with the small stuff and practice.  God is truly working all things together for good.  We get to be partners with God in this healing process.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOur Exodus text and this story from Luke both have an other-worldly feel to them.  They describe mysterious scenes of encounters with the divine that may be, frankly, hard for us to imagine.  God is portrayed as an awe-inspiring glory and over-whelming presence; even God’s messengers take on super-human radiance.  Subsequent verses in Exodus will describe Moses’ luminous face lit from within, requiring a veil so as to not frighten the people of Israel.  Matthew tells of a shift in Jesus’ countenance as he prays; his robes turns a dazzling white; two famous people we know are already dead appear at his side.  Almost sounds like scenes from a B movie!  My eyes reflexively squint as I try to imagine these scenes.  How do we as 21st century people, who don’t regularly see scenes like this except in B movies, engage these texts?  And what do we do with these narratives seem filled with bizarre, perhaps overwrought visions. How might they guide us in this transition period at this church, as we seek to better understand God’s reality and purposes for this congregation? \\n\\tA group of us have been reading and discussing Cynthia Bourgeault’s book, The Wisdom Jesus: A New Perspective on Christ and His Message.   Episcopal priest, mystic and contemplative author, she has presented some real challenges to our group.  Claiming that Jesus came as not so much savior of sinful people but as a life-giver.  As a teacher of the transformation of human consciousness.  And that in following Jesus, we are not so much striving to be good people, but to let the very way our brain operates to be changed, transformed.  Only with that shift in perspective, change of our mental operating systems as she describes it, are we be able to make choices and do the actions of helping humanity that are not based in our own needs for esteem, safety and control.    Bourgeault claims that this is what Jesus meant when he talked about the Kingdom of God, the reign of God is both around and within you.  Open to it!\\n\\tPondering all this, I’ve been wondering what these stories about Moses and then Jesus, each interacting with the divine, have to say about our own inner transformation as Christians.   Why are they included in scripture?  And specifically, what was Jesus doing taking those 3 disciples up to the top of the mountain?  What did he want them to experience and to know deep in their bones?  \\n\\tBiblical scholars have noted that scripture seems to present us with two different ways of relating to God.  One is knowing God in a place.  The other is more connected to knowing God on a journey, on the move. ( “Listening to God: Spiritual Formation in Congregations,” by John Ackerman).  These appear to be both ancient patterns, sometimes called habitation/dwelling spirituality and journey/seeking spirituality.  Think about this for a moment: where do you find you experience God most clearly:  in certain places?  These could be anything from a temple to a church to more ancient religious sites like a grove of sacred trees.  Like religions around the world that have holy places, holy buildings, Jews eventually constructed the Temple in Jerusalem and speak of finding God in it’s inner sanctum, in the Holy of Holies.  Place can give us a sense of belonging to tribe or congregation, our place of worship being a safe haven where we can find answers to life’s perplexing questions, God as “a mighty fortress,” “ the rock of ages,” the refuge to which we can flee.  \\nNot having such a “place,” was the experience of the Israelites fleeing Egypt and then struggling to face the unknown as they traveled through the wilderness:  So often they longed for their previous lives, for their home in Egypt.   I wonder if the small group of disciples, Invited to come up to this lonely mountain with Jesus for prayer, may have been in much the same emotional space.   “Jesus, this is truly amazing!  You, Moses, Elijah.  It’s so good to be here; can’t we have a building campaign, build some cool structures and just stay here with you?”  That yearning for place, a spirituality focused on a habitation, can be strong.\\n\\tBut Jesus seemed to have something else in mind, and it seems to point .   more to a spirituality found in the journey, often a journey through difficult places and times.  Perhaps the disciples are getting a hint of what is coming next for Jesus at this point.  It is midpoint in his ministry and Jesus has begun to talk with them about the fact that he is going to go to Jerusalem.  Going to the huge capital city even though it is dangerous for him.  Even though he will suffer at the hands of the religious and political authorities and he will die.   Like Israelites wandering in the wilderness, the disciples don’t really know when or where they will be led.   Hearing Jesus talk about self-emptying, dying to self, loosing one’s life to find it, has been confusing for the disciples.   Only days before, Jesus warned them of his own death and even their own possible suffering in following him.  Where’s the reassurance and comfort in all this, they may well have asked each other.  When Jesus invites a few of them for a time of private retreat and reflection on top of a mountain, they are blown away by the scene that unfolds before them.  It isn’t surprising that the disciples press for a new habitation, a place to memorialize this amazing spectical:  Jesus glowing radiant and bright, Moses there representing God’s law to the Jews and Elijah the Jewish prophetic tradition; all are right there with him, symbolizing the whole known Hebrew scripture in Jesus’ time.  of a radiant Jesus, flanked by the law-giver Moses and the prophet Elijah.  They will yearn for a “dwelling spirituality” (Ackerman would describe it).  Better to stay and commemorate a glorious past with shelters, booths to commemorate, to institutionalize, what they have seen.  “Rabbi,” cries Peter: “it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!”  \\n\\tBut a cloud overcomes them and they hear a voice: “This is my beloved son” – same words as after Jesus is baptized, but with an addition – “This is my Beloved, listen to him!”  And “suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.”  And immediately they are on the move again, following this one back into the teeming crowds, the healings and preaching, the impending confrontations with the authorities.\\nJesus would not let them stay there.  Which makes me wonder:  where does Jesus call us out?  Where does he not want us to stay any longer as church?  I’m not suggesting abandoning this building, but are there habitations of traditions, of comfort and reassurance, ways of being together that keep us from this journey with Jesus?  Keep us from more fully comprehending where the spirit of the Living Jesus leads next?  \\nAs the scene changes on the mountaintop, and there is regularly old Jesus in his dingy travel robe and sandals, all radiance disippated.  What do the disciples hear?   Keep an ear open to “my beloved Son.”    “Listen” to him.  The presence of Jesus challenges us to another way of being together.  We are to make decisions together because we are listening to Jesus, not to our preferences.  We are to let his vision transform us and inspire us to do things in different ways because following him leads that way.  This means that when it comes to a church vote about something, members are not being asked what their preference would be.  They are being asked which church practice or activity will more faithfully fulfill the current vision and mission of the church.  \\nI also think this invitation to listen to Jesus may be the most important thing we as s church offer to the world.  Come, we don’t give you all the answers, but we will journey with you as together we listen to Jesus.  As we listen to something that is not just us and our own best ideas.  Join us as we will search the scriptures, pay attention to the needs of the world, and prayerfully discern God’s leading together.  The challenge for any congregation is that our dwelling, our place, our rootedness in our traditions together often become our primary focus.  The tension between church being a safe haven and church being a disciple-ship school will always be there.   Today’s texts invite us down from tendency to “build booths,” to only memorize a beloved past.  As John Ackerman observes, “spiritual formation happens when individuals and congregations together can listen to God, obey God, and be transformed by God.”  \\n\\tAnd so we keep listening together as we enter this season of Lent, spiraling back around to this reflective period in the church year in yet a different place as a congregation.  How blessed we are to be together in a church that is not just “building booths” to memorialize the mountain-top past but is moving bravely into God’s future together.   Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nHere we are, about two weeks before Christmas.  Everyone is busy busy busy.   Putting up Christmas trees, making and shopping for presents, Christmas cards, Christmas baking, rehearsing for the Christmas pageant.  Whew!  Some of us are trying not to be naughty, because Santa knows if “knows we’ve been bad or good so,” we’re working hard on behavior.  Lots to pay attention to and prepare for this time of year.\\nSo everything is a bit hurly swirling in our houses, then we come to church and it seems like we have several stories going on all at once.  We have the pageant story of this character Hamil the Camel who looses track of his caravan on the way to see Jesus, and has lots of adventures.  But we also have this other character who doesn’t often make it into the pageant story.  John the Baptist.  The Bible says he was Jesus’ cousin and that he somehow understood that God was about to come into human history in a new way…..through his cousin Jesus!   JOHN was sort of a weird guy, he lived out in the desert outside the big city Jerusalem, wearing raggedly clothes and only eating honey and grasshopers.  And he kept telling people, including important leaders and people in charge, look God wants to you pay attention to your lives, to say you are sorry for the wrong things you do, repent, and get ready to be part of God’s new big deal!   Last week we heard John say to all who would listen: Prepare the way of the Lord!  This week he has some strong words about what that kind of preparation might look like.  He told people that preparing for God’s new action in our lives has a lot to do with sharing, with giving of ourselves.  He got really specific with different people:  If you had two coats, he said give one away to someone who needs one.  If you worked for the Roman rulers by collecting taxes, he said don’t cheat people and keep more than your fair share.  If you were a Roman soldier he said don’t threaten people and take money from them. \\nHmmmm….I thought to myself.  This is a different kind of preparation, isn’t it?  Prepare the way of the Lord by giving some things away, letting go a bit, loosening my hold on what I have. Now this is a different kind of preparing, than just getting my box of Christmas ornaments out and baking my Christmas cookies.   When I prepare for something, like a trip or a big project, I like to make lists and plan in advance, and get my ducks in a row.  Sometimes I leave some things to the last minute, but I really do like to be prepared for stuff.  It makes me feel….well, how does preparation make you feel?   I guess I feel more responsible, competent, people will think I am a good pastor, a great mom, a responsible citizen.  I think preparation also makes us feel safe, maybe because life seems more predictable or more secure.  Okay, I have everything in order, right here around me.  I can control how things are going to turn out, I keep thinking.  Now I feel safe and even protected.\\nBut John tells the people that preparing is about letting go.  This is pretty weird to hear.  This sounds irresponsible, even dangerous.  Many of us think that if we eat the right food and exercise then we will never get sick.  If we work hard and save, we will have an untroubled retirement.  That if we parent in the right way, our kids will seldom face challenges.  That if we find the perfect permanent pastor, we will never have to deal with conflict again in the church.  \\tJohn is talking about preparation so we can receive God’s transformative work in our lives.  He says our preparation has to involve a loosening of our grip, not tightening, controlling.  This is hard to hear when many of us are worried about our safety in our communities and in our nation.  To counter all this predicted violence, we decide need more stuff, like military force and police protection and personal guns to prepare and protect ourselves.  More stringent laws to keep certain people out of our country because we imagine they might hurt us.   And we get more suspicious, more anxious…..and think our preparations of walls and new legal restrictions and armaments will keep us safe.   John the Baptist was certainly not naïve about malicious powers in the world.  But we might do well to be more thoughtful, less reactionary and fearful, when it comes to preparing for true well-being in our country.\\nMaybe in these few weeks leading up to Christmas, we might think about what “preparing the way of the Lord” might look like for each of us, for us as a church, and even for our nation.  Where do I need to let go of my tight hold on my assumptions, my plans, my stuff?  I love how Hamil the Camel  grapples with this in the pageant story: sometimes it takes giving up something that is of great value to us…but is needed elsewhere.  And in the loosening, the letting go, the sharing…..we don’t cling as tightly to the limited solutions that we imagine, to the narrow future that our anxieties demand.  We ourselves are changed.  We become prepared to welcome God in new ways into our lives.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t ',\n",
       " '\\tSometimes we are offered an odd scrap of scripture, such as this piece from Proverbs, that doesn’t seem to make much sense in our 21st century lives.  Why do we need etiquitte advice about coming into a king’s presence or standing in the place of the great?  When was the last time you bumped into someone really powerful or famous?  As I consider this Proverbs passage, I keep flashing on royal court scenes from “Game of Thrones.” Is this advice about humility, or simply self-survival in the presence of unpredictable leader elite?   And what do we make of this curious dinner table scene from the Gospel of Luke?  Is Jesus continuing the humility advice from Proverbs, or offering a bizarre suggestion on how to assemble a party guest list?  Humility in the face of priviledge and power, decisions about who we are to associate with and why….how do we make sense out of all this?\\n\\tThe Book of Proverbs is collection of practical advice from all over the ancient near East, and was assembled probably around the 6th through 5th century BCE.  This Biblical material is old….but is it durable, relevant for our world where we don’t even have kings and queens, much less have opportunity to be introduced into a royal court?!  Unlike other parts of the Hebrew Bible, Proverbs contains no direct divine speech, no legal codes, no any stories about Jewish history.  It’s just down-to-earth advice on how to live, how our characters are formed so we may make wise descisions and choices in our lives.  Much of it is aimed at the moral development of across the lifespan: like “hear, my child, your father’s instruction, and do not reject your mother’s teaching, for they are a fair garland for your head (Proverbs 1:8).”  “Do not be wise in your own eyes; but fear the LORD and turn away from evil.”  Unfortunately, many of us may associate Proverbs with priggish, uptight moralizing against all things fun and exciting, sort of like our Puritan ancestors on steroids.  And who wants to go around “fearing the LORD” anyway?  Frankly, I’ve never been interested in a God that I must approach with cringing terror.   The “fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,” insists Proverbs.  What?   Jesus would have been steeped in knowledge of Proverbs from his study of Jewish scriptures, and he never seemed to “fear” God.  \\nBut it appears that our English translation for the word “fear” just doesn’t capture the original Hebrew. “Yirat Adonai,” fear of the LORD, in Hebrew, actually means awe, reverence, respect.  Not tremble-in-your-boots.  How does “having awe and reverence for God” connect with this advice about serving in a royal court?  Is our attitude towards God connected to how we are with other people?  There is something about humility in here, perhaps not assuming I have all the answers, or a place of priviledge and status.  For the authors of Proverbs, a sense of awe and reverence for God may have some connection with how I view others, and my behavior around other people.  \\n\\tReturning to Luke.  Once again, Jesus is sitting around having a meal with people.  But Jesus practices a strange sort of table manners.  He seems to be in a habit of offending his hosts, and in today’s passage from Luke he does it again. It’s dinner at the local legal experts’, the Pharisees, home, and on a Sabbath evening.  Jesus has just shocked and annoyed his host by curing some man who has wandered on to the scene.  The host’s consternation is not just about uptight legalism. The Sabbath day of rest was an important and vibrant spiritual practice for 1st century Jews.  Observing Sabbath traditions was a way of showing awe and respect for God.  It reminded them that they were human and not hardier than God, who symbolically “took a break” on the seventh day of Creation. Was Jesus flaunting this tradition? \\n\\tAt tonight’s banquet, Jesus pushes his challenge of the cultural norms..   Lavish dinners worldwide have been part of a social elites’ way of establishing power and maintaining connections with other elites. If you invited a fellow elite, that person would be obligated to repay you with a return invitation.   And, in both Jewish and Greco Roman societies of the time, the poor and the physically disabled or sick were to avoided at such gatherings, because of course, “they are not like us and we certainly don’t want to be like them.”  \\n\\tJesus notices the distinguished guests jockeying for position around the table, and admonishes them to take the lower place.  Well, isn’t that just common courtesy?  And they might even get the self-serving chance to be invited publicly to the table, notes Jesus.  (I can almost see him slyly smirk to himself as he suggests this).  “Oh, of course,” intone the dinner guests, “good suggestion, Jesus.”  Nevertheless, Jesus has suggested a stance of public humility, which was apparently a challenge for this crowd.\\n\\tBut then Jesus launches into this rather bizarre suggestion for his esteemed host:  the people you should really invite to your big party are the town low-life, all these marginalized losers.  And you will you be blessed for doing this!  Because they can’t repay you!   Jesus, has now entertwined humiity with a true hospitality challenge.  We are called to be more than friendly to those who are like you and can return the favor.  Our current immigration debate stirs in my brain.  Who do we welcome to our table?  I can hear this first century dinner  crowd begin to gumble, “I don’t know Jesus, I’m glad to try humility among my own crowd.  But maybe it is not wise to be that hospitable.”   \\n\\tOne of the Biblical commentators I read this week noted that the Book of Proverbs describes how the way to learn humility is all around us.  It’s like we live in a daily “classroom of wisdom” writes the Presbyterian minister and OT scholar , Anne Stewart  \\nHow easy to dismiss this as simply being a “goody two shoes,” a nice, polite person who steps back and doesn’t make waves.  But Stewart suggests that humility is probably the chief character virtue described in Proverbs and that we have ample opportunities to practice it everyday.  In traffic, in grocery store lines, during times of inconvenience and stress.  I find this challenging myself, because my day seems a lot easier if I don’t have to keep reflecting on what is happening inside me!  But again and again, Jesus leans into this Biblical tradition of acquiring wisdom in the daily classroom of life.  We are called to notice:  in a confusing or anxious situation, is it my ego need to be right that rules my responses?  Or do I pause for a moment before responding reactively?  How might I listen more closely to this other person before making a judgement?  What is God seeking to have me know in my moment of consternation?  Like the Pharisee’s dinner table guests, I seem to be invited again and again to humbly face my own priviledge: as an educated person, as a white person, as a person with access to adequate food, shelter and healthcare.  What assumptions and choices do I make out of this priviledge?\\nIt has struck me this week that practicing humility and hospitality isn’t just some self-improvement project.  Perhaps we start to listen to immigration stories differently, recognizing that Jesus would invite people different from us to the table of our lives.  We become humbly curious about people whose world views and experiences sharply contrast with our own.  We begin to stretch our imaginations to think about how the Kingdom of God, this welcome table, has to somehow include everyone.  We start talking together about how our actions, as individuals and as a church, might make an impact on stretching this countries welcome of immigrants and refugees.  And slowly, this kind of pondering changes us.  It enables us to be of even greater service in this audacious task of healing of the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " \"\\t I love this tongue-in-cheek way that the Gospel writer Luke sets the stage for Jesus birth. In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered.  This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria,  Excuse me, but “all the world should be registered?” What imperial grandiosity!  Rome thinks it can register, count, tax, everyone in “all the world.” The hubris of it all!  Such a sly way to contrast thumb your nose at a pompous political leader who insisted that you call “Son of God.”  This blustering and imperious August in the same story with the birth of a little someone with questionable pedigree, little money, powerless peasant parents who birthed their cradled their newborn in a crude food trough meant for animals.  Born into this everyday world of authoritative structures and powers who tell you where to go and when.  “We are the boss,” proclaims the empire,  “we tell you now, Joseph and Mary, to go to Bethlehem and get registered.  Because we are the mighty, prestigious empire which is ruled by the demi-god Augustus, who spreads the Good News of his rule throughout his realm.”   Here is the everyday world that Jesus is born into, and which Fanthorpe describes in her poem BC:AD…\\n\\tThis was the moment when Before\\n\\tTurned into After, and the future’s \\n\\tUninvented timekeepers presented arms.\\n\\n\\tThis was the moment when nothing\\n\\tHappened.  Only dull peace\\n\\tSprawled boringly over the earth.\\n\\n\\tThis was the moment when even energetic Romans \\n\\tCould find nothing better to do\\n\\tThan counting heads in remote provinces.\\n\\nSo what if another baby is born; this is nothing miraculous.  The child’s parents are clearly nobodies, had no place better to stay, are outsiders, strangers traveling from a distant town.  Tiny baby, big empire.  There are always new babies, and the empire churns on, and often grinds up young people through wars or unemployment or despair over their futures.  Empires grind on in all their authoritative glory.   \\t\\n\\tBut Luke wants us to know that things are not always as they seem.  Something else is astir, besides Roman once again flexing its imperial muscles.  Out in the fields, where it is dark and cold, where the shepherds hang out because they are not really welcome in the town, because they are low-life, uneducated, smelly, marginalized….out in these fields something is happening.    “What is that?”  one shepherd asks another.  “Huh?  I think I dozed off…”  “No, look, over there….something glimmers and shakes and whoa what is up with the sky??”   All of a sudden the young men see an angel standing before them.  A glowing light?  A human-like figure in a white robe with wings?  Shimmering, golden energy?  We don’t know.  We only read that the “glory of the Lord shown around them and they were terrified.” \\n\\tLest we get the readers get caught up in this wild epiphany of God’s manifest power in a swirl of celestial angels, Luke gives the shepherds, and us, pause:  “The glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.  But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid.”  Apparently the word for “afraid” also can mean refer to adoration/reverence: “reverencing,” which adds a curious twist to the scene.  The shepherds are probably in a clumsy tangle of awe, stupefied and overwhelmed by this point, falling all over themselves in reverance and devotion at the angel’s feet.  “Do not be reverencing; stop reverencing me!” cries the angel.  “All this fanfare is not the point.  In fact, don’t be looking for fanfare, because God is showing up in something more ordinary than you could ever imagine.”   Stop looking for the visible hoopla, and the power moves and some flashy acpolocalyptic arrival of God’s forces overthrowing those repressive Romans.  Pay attention to the ordinary, the small, the marginalized, the edges.  That’s where God is quietly at work.  “I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord.”  “Okay, shepherds, here is the part that won’t make much sense: this will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.” \\n\\tWell, this would be the last place any observant Jew in the first century would expect to find the Messiah, the in-breaking of God’s kingdom on earth with the one would redeem Israel.  And I daresay, there are many places in our daily world where we no not expect to find the Christ, to find God’s presence, to find God’s reign of mercy and justice unfolding.  Unfortunately, the church universal has been somewhat at fault here.  Through the years, the worldwide church has often limited God’s presence to a certain big-deal belief about Jesus or certain important practices and traditions of particular church bodies.   And somehow our lives got divided up between the sacred and secular, faith and not faith, God-infused and devoid of God.  Church and the rest of our lives.  \\n \\tAnd this was the moment (the poet continues)\\n\\tWhen a few farm workers and three\\n\\tMembers of an obscure Persian sect\\n\\tWalked haphazard by starlight straight\\n\\tInto the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\nOrdinariness suddenly collides with the extraordinary at Christmas.  Our everyday world entered in by the God of the universe.  “And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory,” and “to all who receive him, God gives power to become children of God.”  That’s us, walking somewhat haphazardly each day, right into the kingdom of heaven.  Because it’s here, this kingdom of heaven, this reign of righteousness and peace, in spite of appearances. It’s here in the disappointment following an election, it’s here in the wondering about “what will be next?  where will I intervene in all this apparent falling-apartness, in a way that will make a difference?” The kingdom of heaven, God’s empowering love and acceptance, is sitting among us and within us, in our darkest fears and our brightest hopes.   \\n\\nThis was the moment when Before\\nTurned into After, and the future's\\nUninvented timekeepers presented arms.\\n\\nThis was the moment when nothing\\nHappened. Only dull peace\\nSprawled boringly over the earth.\\n\\nThis was the moment when even energetic Romans\\nCould find nothing better to do\\nThan counting heads in remote provinces.\\n\\nAnd this was the moment\\nWhen a few farm workers and three\\nMembers of an obscure Persian sect\\nWalked haphazard by starlight straight\\nInto the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\nAt Christmas, we say that this everyday world is infused with the living God, light in our darkness even when all looks pretty dim.  And so we live in it, this world impregnated with the kingdom of heaven: we love in it, we vote in it, we get our hands dirty cleaning it up and reaching out to those on the margins, on the edges, those unacknowledged or discredited by the empire of the day.  For God so loved the world, that God sent us the Word made flesh, light in our darkness.  Into this everyday world, enfused with this God in whom we live and move and have our being.   Thanks be to God!  \\nMerry Christmas and Amen.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This tale about a man with two sons is probably familiar to some, but others of you may be hearing it for the first time.   Jesus tells this story after being accused by local religious officials of grossly inappropriate conduct:  why do you welcome sinners and eat with them?!  Now, it appears that Jesus had a rather annoying way of answering questions:  he would go “sideways” and tell a deceptively simple story intended to unsettle or upend the questioners’ assumptions about God.  In answer to “why are you hanging out with sinners, the rejected dregs of our society?” Jesus told several stories about things that are lost and eventually found.  A lost sheep, a lost coin, and now a lost son (or rather two lost sons, but I’m getting ahead of myself here). \\nLots of good family drama here in today’s tale.   Some contemporary listeners find that the all-male cast throws them off.  We might reframe it so we can hear it again:  “once there was a woman who had two daughters.”   Imagine the younger daughter striding across the stage, eager to strike out on her own.  There she goes, with a fat cashier’s check from her mother, headed out to one coast or the other:  New York City?  San Francisco? Her costume: rebellious Goth-style black?  Give her a lot of body piercings, a few tattoos; in the next scene, watch her party and befriend questionable people.  See the money go up her nose, observe the mounting credit card debt.  New friends sense the party is over and start to slip away.  Has an older boyfriend abused her somewhere along this journey? Maybe she gets pregnant.  At some point, everything starts to fall apart for this young woman.  It takes awhile, she does odd jobs, maybe she ends up cleaning public toilets, whatever unskilled job that makes us cringe to hear of it.  Eventually, she comes to her senses, to herself, and heads back to northern Virginia.  Big welcome from Mom, who buys her expensive designer jeans and a new laptop; big resentment from older sister who has stayed close to Mom, helping take care of an elderly family member, working hard at a boring hourly job, night classes at the local community college, helping out with service projects at church.  All that dutifulness and now this??!  Mom wants to throw a big party with expensive food and wine to welcome home this lost #2 daughter; #1 daughter is livid.  We are left having to decide whether or not elder daughter ever talks with her younger sister again, much less joins the party.  Here, echoing down from two thousand years ago, is an unsettlingly contemporary, family drama most of us have played out, as one character or another, at some point in our lives.\\nWhat was Jesus up to with this parable?  As usual, telling the story is the way Jesus was responding to someone else’s question.  Religious leaders were noting that Jesus had taken to publicly relaxing and eating with all kinds of riffraff, sinners: sick people, poor people, foreigners – the “lost” of their society.  Jesus hears the Pharisees and scribes grumbling among themselves about this, and he proceeds to side step into three stories about things that are “lost.” His provocative message would seep into their minds and hearts “side-ways,” as if to avoid the listeners’ natural defensiveness or rationalizations.  \\nJesus’ reputation for spending time with the dregs of society was problematic for the Jewish leaders, Pharisees and scribes, not because they were particularly evil or even hypocritical.  The welfare of their communities was forefront in their minds, especially under Roman occupation, and their religious laws regarding keeping “pure” were important to the well being of the whole community.  Not unlike responsible employers in any business, they had to keep a close eye on the bottom line.  Associating with people who had clearly violated God’s laws was not good for the whole community. It did not fit into the overall “economy” of how to run things.  From their perspective, one must keep track of how each individual contributes to the whole.  To be fair to everyone in a business or a community in difficult times, when the employee’s misdeeds add up, it’s only fair to let that person go. \\nIn response to the religious leaders grumblings about fairness, equity, the bottom line, Jesus introduces a different economic paradigm.  He tells several stories about things that get lost and the prodigal, extravagantly wasteful-seeming measures people take to reinstate the lost.   The returning son is barely repentant before the father perhaps unwisely draws him so dramatically back into the family fold.  Is nobody keeping track of the till here?  This is the older son’s question, and there is truth in it.  Come on Dad, this son of yours has not played by the rules.  It’s just not right!  And yes, the younger son was manipulative when he left and probably even when he returned, especially since his behavior would surely heap communal shame upon his father.  Perhaps we are too quick to simply affirm God’s generosity, and let go of all accountability?   Doesn’t God call us to be diligent and accountable workers in the field of the world?  But the problem for these two sons is that both of them seem to treat Dad like an employer, and only see themselves as workers.   The younger son, hopes to be reinstated at whatever menial position Dad might offer.  The older son, feeling unappreciated for his persistent hard labor, angrily opposes the idea of someone getting rewarded for nothing.   Stuck in their employee roles, they seem to have lost a wider vision of family and being part of God’s family.  \\nThe father is working out of another economic system that is about being part of God’s reconciling family.  Sinners, loosers, the lost are welcomed by God, because God is all about relationship.  Perhaps the Apostle Paul in the passage from 2 Corinthians can provide perspective.  “In Christ, we no longer regard each other from a human, in the flesh, point of view,” writes Paul, to a group of church people with whom he has been having difficulty.  He speaks of all of us being reconciled through Christ, and that it is now our job to be ambassadors of this love, helping reconcile the people of the world.   Both brothers see themselves as laborers in Dad’s field and assume they should be treated accordingly: one penalized, the other rewarded.  But the father doesn’t see them this way, and Jesus seems to suggest that we shouldn’t either.  The larger question may be: do we want to be “right” or do we want to be in relationship?\\nReconciliation, which ironically is an accounting term referring to balance sheets, is our new job says the apostle Paul.  And, at the same time, we are not the ones who make it all balance!  Paul is on to something here:  When we treat each other as new creatures, humans being transformed into the likeness of Christ, we are calling something forth in each other.  This is particularly difficult in families and also hard within the church community.  Past failures, offenses, hurts keep getting counted and recalculated.  But in the middle of those mounting resentments and guilt about the past, God calls us to see each other as new creations.  To reach out to the one another as those reconciled to God.  Just as the father leaps up and runs to the returning son, God moves towards us in reconciliation the very moment we point ourselves towards God, towards our soul’s home.  We each are “new creations” in God’s eyes; this is what the father saw as his younger son approached.  Someone who had been lost was found; someone who was dead was now alive.  \\nThe curtain comes down on this family story before we know how it ends.  I’m sure Jesus’ listeners were antsy with anticipation as he finally fell silent.  What happens next? They demand.  I am left with this image of the older son, who hears the music and revelry of the homecoming party and is just seething.  Maybe this character is a reminder to those of us who have labored long in the church, been faithful in the pews, the church kitchen, the upkeep of the grounds, the outrearch projects.  We hung in there!  We do well, myself included, to watch this older son carefully.  Is that the bile of resentment rising in his throat?    Perhaps he is stuck in his world of equity and fairness.  At some deep level, he too is one of “lost” who needs to be found.   The father speaks to him tenderly, reminding him that he too is family:  you have always been with me; all that I have is yours.  \\nA cautionary tale, this story is.  It’s easy to get stuck in the shame of mistakes, in a far country, and never return home.   We can also exile ourselves to a far country of resentments; we can stay stuck out on the back forty, kicking dirt clods, being “right” but alienated and alone and missing the party.  Ultimately, it is not about our coming or going, leaving or staying, but allowing ourselves to be found by God’s love, to be made new.  And knowing ourselves to be found, we do the work of finding the other “lost” ones.  “We are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making God’s appeal through us.”  What would it look like this week, in our individual lives and in our life as a congregation, to reach out to the “lost?”  Where will we each be called to make God’s appeal of extravagant welcome this week?  May we continue to move into life as part of God’s reconciled family.  Amen.\\n\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " 'Hopefully you have had a chance by now to read my message in the September newsletter that went out this last week.  I wrote about a book I have been reading called Christianity after Religion: The End of the Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening.  A surprising title, perhaps a bit off-putting? Christianity AFTER religion?  It’s written by Dianna Butler Bass, an American church historian who travels the country exploring what is going on in local Protestant churches.  A church-going Christian herself, she loves Jesus and she loves the church…and she believes the church as we know it is going through a time of profound decline…..  She talks a lot in her book about the most rapidly growning category of religious affiliation in the country:  the “nones,” those who when asked their religious affiliation reply “none.”  Most of the “nones” however, describe themselves as believing in God, praying regularly and as being spiritual but not religious.  Butler Bass contends that the church, in order to both survive and flourish, needs to pay close attention to the “nones.” They have much to teach us about what may be wrong with institutional Christianity, with church as most of us know it.   And this, DBB says, is the good news.  With each decline there is opportunity for renewal.  It’s part of our faith as Christians.  Death leading to resurrection.  Death of our old self, as we are forgiven and loved by God, rising and becoming more like Jesus each day.  We know about renewal as Christians.  But how will we church people talk about this renewal to those who say they are “spiritual but not religious?”  Many of them have either been very hurt by religious institutions or simply find them contentious, or boring or simply irrelevant to their lives?  This is the challenge that lies ahead for the church. \\n\\nI think Jesus, along with most people in Biblical times, would have found this distinction between spirituality and religion curious and maybe even amusing.   Their lives were not guided by our predominant culture’s value of rugged individualism, the self-made and independent man or woman.  They would not have understood our persistent striving for autonomy and self-definition that marks adolescent and young adult years in most of the United States.  That often includes rejection of our parents’ traditions. For the Jews of the Hebrew Bible life was all about community, about the community’s connection, covenant, with God, not just the individual’s private experience of God. Doing their religion was not a separate once-a-week part of their lives, but a complex web of actions and meaning that held their very lives together. \\n\\nI have found it helpful to remember that the Latin origins of the word “religion” derive from the word “ligare” meaning to bind or connect.   “Re-ligare” – to reconnect; that is the root of what religion meant.   Since ancient times, the purposes of religious ritual, sacred symbols and texts, have been to reconnect people with the divine, rebind people with one another and with their innermost beings.   I wonder if there isn’t a persistent human tendency to fight against this “rebinding,” this “reconnecting.”   We would rather go it alone, I guess.  I see this as part of human sinfulness: our human tendency to drift away from, to hurt, each other and consequently isolate ourselves from the source of our being.  Being in community is hard work.  It takes honesty, forgiveness, understanding, patience.\\n\\nThis story from Mark tells of some conflict around particular religious customs of the Jesus’ time that were making it hard for people to “rebind” and reconnect.”  These traditions of hand-washing were not written into Jewish law, but had grow up around the Temple worship practices.  Given God’s awesome otherness, holiness, it was assumed that humans must also be holy, undefiled, spiritually and physically clean before God. \\n\\nSo here we see Jesus confronting the religious leaders of his day.  Part of the Pharisees survival strategy in leading their people was to help them stay separate from, distinctive from, what they believed to be the surrounding corrosive aspects of Roman rule and Greek culture.  One of the ways they did this was through new interpretations of Mosaic law.  Here, Jesus  is defending his disciples practice of not ritually washing their hands before they eat.  This is not an argument about hygiene, but about what has become hallowed religious ritual: it’s about “observing the tradition of the elders.” But this washing custom had become a sacred cow of the Judean elite: those who had the time, the money and the water available to them to fulfill a number of complex, group identifying rituals around food.  Jesus will have nothing to do with this purity code that actually serves to disconnect, not reconnect, people.  Blasting these Pharisees and the Judean elite to be “hypocrites,” Jesus condemns them with the prophet Isaiah’s words:  your hearts are far from God; you teach human precepts as doctrines, holding to human tradition and not the commandments of God. \\n\\nThis is hardly a comforting passage for contemporary religious institutions, I must say, including most local churches.   “Human traditions” are a big part of what makes a congregation feel like home; these customs are often the things that seem to define us, identify us as a church, be it a certain style of music or time of Sunday worship or Sunday School.  This can be tricky, because sometimes a legacy that members hope to preserve can be the barrier to the new thing that God hopes to do in our midst.  REPEAT.  It can sometimes be the thing that keeps us connecting with the unchurched and the dechurched who are hungry to experience the Good News and yearn to connect with a vibrant worshipping community.  \\n\\nChurch legacies and traditions we love can sometimes get in the way of the new thing God wants to do among us.  Which leads me to the difficult part of this sermon:  While I have been with you only a little over two years, I know that even an interim pastor such as myself can become part of a church’s legacy and tradition.  While it may not seem so in the moment, my on-going presence at Immanuel is going to get in the way of the new thing God is planning for you as a church.  Your new settled pastor!  We all knew this from the beginning, back when we agreed to journey together through this transition time, that I would not be a candidate for your settled pastor.  We have spent our time together reviewing your history, getting more clear about your values and beliefs and identity as a congregation and renewing your sense of purpose and mission as a church.  Your Pastoral Search Committee was formed, did a huge survey of the congregation and is actively interviewing candidates that will be a good match with you in ministry.  We are nearing the time when the tradition of “Pastor Anne” leading Immanuel must end.  Yesterday I accepted a call to serve as interim pastor at a congregation in the suburban Washington DC area.  This all happened so quickly over this holiday weekend that their search committee has yet to inform their other candidates.  I will have to wait a few days to tell you the church name and town, which I will do in a formal resignation letter sent to our whole congregation.  My final Sunday will be at the end of October.  Through the coming two months, I invite us to talk openly with about this transition time together.  What went well?  What might we have done differently?  It will be difficult to say goodbye to you, as you have both challenged and loved me well.\\n\\nJesus perceived that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  He sensed that clinging to certain human traditions were hindering the incoming of this new reign of God.  Traditions that exclude people, be it hand-washing requirements or ministries that simply do not relate to our 21st century context, will need to change. Traditions that cling to old leadership will need to change.  God’s commandments always point us forward, towards the new thing God is doing in our midst.  And may we be re-connected and re-vitalized by true religion that is life-giving and true. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n ',\n",
       " '\\tPreaching on Mother’s Day would seem to be a no-brainer:  the Sanctuary is fuller than usual and the theme is so Biblical sounding: sacrificial mother love.  Pastors welcome the opportunity to relate such mother love to the generosity and persistence of God’s love for humans.  (In spite of the fact that Mother’s Day as we know it in the USA – dare we admit it - is wildly commercialized, and often cloyingly sentimental.)  But in the church, we jump in and celebrate with gusto, our men rising early once again to cook breakfast, flowers appearing for all the ladies – its wonderful.   \\n\\tBut both mother memories and the experience of mothering are a complicated mix.   On Mother’s Day we remember that while everyone has literally had a mother, some may have never met that person or have become estranged from her.  Most of us lose our mothers in death before we ourselves die.  There are those among us who have mostly happy memories of our mothers.  There are those among us for whom the memories are a shadowy vagueness at best.  At worst they are filled with deep sadness, or sometimes even with error and hate.  For some among us, Mother’s Day is experienced as awkward or downright painful.   We do well not to generalize about thus tender day.\\n\\tTo complicate things even more on Mother’s Day, there are a wide variety of experiences related to being or not being a mother.   Joy and grief, missed opportunities and unwanted responsibilities, accomplishment and failure, sin and forgiveness.  Unforgiveness, regret, surprise, hope.   It’s all intricately connected to human love and relationship: trying to love, failing to love, being loved, feeling loved, feeling unloved.  We claim as Christians, God is love.  Given this context of Mother’s Day, what more might we understand about love?  \\n\\tIn these final words to his followers at the Last Supper in John, Jesus uses the vineyard metaphor to describe the organic unity between God, Jesus and the community of faith.  God’s loving actions, like an attentive gardener, shape us.  As the branches on the vine, our leafy tendrils draw their sustanence from Jesus, the central branch which is grounded in God the creator.  “Abide in me,” says Jesus; and in the following verses, “abide in my love.”   Back and forth the imagery is woven, “abide in me,” “my words abide in you,” “keep my commandments and abide in my love,” all pointing towards the purpose of the vine: the bearing of fruit, the works of love that become the mark of faithful community. “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you,” says Jesus.\\n\\tThis is mysterious language, symbolic of an unseen reality that permeates who we are as followers of Jesus.   God and the spirit of the Risen Jesus, making their home, abiding with us, in us.  They take up residence in us as we love Jesus and obey his commandments.  You and I are the home, homes, essentially, of the Creator of the Universe.  I don’t take this to mean we are God’s only home; what is suggested here is simply that God and the Risen Jesus take up residence in us.  How are we to make sense of this?   \\n\\t A few years ago, my sister-in-law sent out a Mother’s Day email from her home in Pittsburg, to all of us Swallow women.  She urged us to visit a website she had been tracking, which followed the nesting habits of two peregrine falcon females in the tall buildings of downtown Pittsburg, PA where she lives.  Live-streaming web cams had been placed above each of the two nests and were capturing all the mothering action!  “Check this out,” wrote Laura, “I look in on these two Mama birds several times a day and I’m rooting for them.”  Of course, I quickly logged on to the web site, and watched in fascination while a group of 5 tiny chicks were rolling around on top of each other, live, impatiently waiting for the return of their mama bird. Then switching to the Gulf Tower at the U of Pittsburg, I witnessed the second mother hunkered down over her unhatched eggs, visibly shivering in the blustery wind.  Traffic sounds bristled through the microphones.  I checked back in on the five chicks.  Mom had now returned, and they were all making a quite racket as she bustled around the nest stuffing food into their gaping mouths.  After drastic decline in the 1960’s, as a result of  environmental toxins and loss of habitat, these falcons were again making their home among us, were reproducing and mothering.  \\n\\tThinking about these beautiful and powerful peregrine falcons who had almost disappeared, I reflected on how sometimes we get to a point where our sense of connection with the living God almost disappears, even dies.  Perhaps this has happened to you at some time in your life, or maybe even now.  That place, that nest within that held a sense of God seems to have fallen into disrepair, or it has simply shattered in our hearts.  It gets harder to be loving ot others.  We can’t even imagine God finding a home in us anymore, nesting within us.  Or maybe it seems like this has never even really happened.  A home, a nest, in me, for the Creator of the Universe, for the Spirit of the Risen Jesus?   Inspired by the best of mother love, is this the way we might learn how to be more loving with one another.  Might a form of obedience to God be daring to let God find a home in us?\\t\\nOne of my teachers in seminary (Henry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest and theologian), spoke about how we can “slowly build a little nest” of prayer and openness for God inside of us.  It’s as though the words of simple prayer, even a slowly repeated short phrase such as “O God, I need you,” or “Jesus, have mercy on me,” or “Dear Lord, thank-you,” build a nest.  These daily, simple prayers “slowly build a little nest for themselves in our heart and stay there for the rest of our busy day.”  Even while we are talking, working, driving, cooking dinner, these short prayers “can continue in our heart and keep us aware of God’s ever-present guidance” (p. 82, The Way of the Heart).\\nMaybe this is how we learn to love God:  slowly, obediently building this nest inside, stick by twig, fiber by feather, prayer by prayer.  A nest to receive the living presence of God who so wants to make a home within us.  God deeply longs to settle in the nest of our hearts and create the new within us.  And this is how we become more able to love oneanother. God is the loving nesting One in our midst.  That is the Good News for Mother’s Day.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.      \\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t ',\n",
       " 'As we listen to this passage from the Gospel of Mark, we might easily picture Jesus in someone’s home, relaxing with friends after a day of walking through Galilee.  He has just welcomed a small, dark-haired child up into his lap.  A boy or a girl, we are not told.  Does the little one lean into Jesus, calm in his strong, wood-worker arms?  Or does the child seem surprised, even startled, and is now peering quizzically up into Jesus’ face?  We don’t know.  What we can presume is that there are probably other children in the home Jesus is visiting, as part of the extended family of both householders and servants.  Probably the children are on the edge of this scene, crouched in the shadows.  Watching curiously, they might whisper excitedly among themselves.  “Hey, look at that, Benjamin’s little sister is sitting in the Rabbi’s lap!  Oooh, don’t the disciples look surprised?!  Hey, they look kind of mad; we shouldn’t really be in here!”   \\nThese kids would know their place, which was certainly NOT at the foot of a male teacher surrounded by male disciples.  They are children, non-persons, after all, in an ancient world that simply does not acknowledge them as having value or social status.  This may seem strange to us, particularly in the developed Western world where our culture seems overly youth oriented. Things were quite different in Biblical times:  the ancient Greek word for “child” was the same word as “servant,” lowest of the low.  A child’s role was to serve or work for the family, starting at a young age.  A child’s place was out-of-sight, with the other non-persons, the women of the household and the hired servants.   \\nSo what is Jesus doing with a small, non-person on his lap?  As we imagine this scene in our mind’s eye, we might recall another occasion where Jesus encountered young children.  He was teaching before a crowd and a group of kids pressed up against him.  The disciples tried to shoo away this pesky interruption and Jesus reprimanded the adults, saying: “Let the little children come to me, for to such belongs the Kingdom of God.”   The disciples didn’t seem to understand what he was talking about, and I wonder if we really do either.  In fact, this command may seem a bit unsettling for us as adults: was Jesus suggesting we BE like children?  Aren’t children naïve in their innocence, and, well, dependent?  Vulnerable, certainly not street smart.  Is this how we model ourselves as adult Christians?  That doesn’t sound very wise or practical. \\nBut Jesus taught his followers that they would be wise to be like children, if they wanted to be included in God’s reign.  Well, this is very tender and dear, we might say to ourselves, Jesus had a special affinity for young people.  Not unlike how many of us feel as we watch our church children stream forward for the children’s time here at Immanuel.   In spite of their squirmy and sometimes noisey presence in worship, children often bring us sense of lightness, hopefulness about the future for a congregation.  We might even pat ourselves on the collective back, since we live in a predominate culture that so clearly values children, unlike that misguided ancient first century world.  We now have car seat laws and a vast public school system.  We have multiple enrichment opportunities of art and music, organized and adult-directed sports, and an ever expanding landslide of child-specific consumer goods.  In the 21st century we seem to be a nation that pays a lot of loving attention to children.   \\nWE SEEM TO pay them attention, and yet our child poverty statistics indicate a different story.  Of the 21 most affluent nations in the world, the United States has the highest percentage of poor children.  According to Marian Wright Edelman of the Children’s Defense Fund, 1 in 6 children live in poverty in the US, with 40% of those being in extreme poverty.  That’s currently 13 million children who live in families who struggle below the federal poverty level, on the margins of our daily world, no-bodies going no-where.  In spite of our sentimental views toward children in our predominant culture, we may be closer to the first century world than we think.   Something to consider as we make decisions about where to send our outreach and missions funds each year.\\nIn first century reality, Jesus would not be perceived as being sweet and tender, sitting there with a child in his lap.  His action would have been perceived as inappropriate and quite provocative.  Let’s retrace the context, for a moment.  He has just finished talking to his disciples for a second time about the fact that he is going to be “betrayed into human hands” and be killed.  He mentions that he will rise again, which you think might have caught the disciples attention.  But no, the disciples remain silent, apparently afraid to pursue this whole distressing matter further.   And haven’t we all felt far over our heads at times and simply clammed-up?  I recall different times in my life, in a high school math class or seminary seminar or even in a political discussion with friends, when I have been afraid to even ask a question.  I didn’t want to look stupid, or not well-informed, child-like, so I kept quiet.   I can’t blame the disciples, really:  It was probably quite crushing news that Jesus was not going to be the kind of political Messiah everyone hoped for.  Jesus was not to be the one to lead some military effort to crush God’s enemies, the Roman Empire legions occupying their land. \\n The disciples are so frozen in their confusion that they turn on one another, and start bickering among themselves.  How often do we have arguments with our children or spouses, and realize later that THAT really wasn’t what was bothering us.  It was something way bigger, way more overwhelming and we just couldn’t face it in the moment.  Better to bicker about who forgot to buy the milk, which is another version of the disciples debate about “who is the greatest.” Safer to argue about some small stuff than to look at the big worries, the big hurts in our life together.  Like your beloved Teacher heading towards betrayal and death.   \\n “What were you all arguing about?” asks Jesus.  Again, the disciples don’t answer Jesus.   Probably ashamed, they ignore him as they enter the house together.  And at that point Jesus SITS DOWN.  Sitting, instead of standing, was the authoritative teaching position in ancient times.  Jesus sits down and says, “”Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.”   Be like a servant, be a nobody, be like a child.   This seems pretty whimpy.   Yet the Bible repeatedly describes a righteous person not as someone who is perfect, but as someone who sees themselves as “a child of the Lord.” \\nJesus reaches down, takes a child into his arms.  “Whoever welcomes this little one in my name, welcomes me, and the one who sends me.  God.”   And THERE, he does it again.  Jesus challenges and reverses the disciples’ expectations in one swipe.  One leaning down and scooping up of a small child into his arms.   “You want to be great?” Jesus provocatively stares down his followers, “ welcome the ones who aren’t great.”  \\nThis is the paradoxical wisdom of servanthood as Jesus describes it:  welcoming those who are powerless, those who are vulnerable.  How are we to be wise servants?  Might we welcome new and different groups to use this vast and beautiful church building, empty during so much of the week?  Might we spend some time visiting not just with friends during Coffee Hour, but by welcoming and conversing with someone we don’t recognize?  Perhaps we might try to learn the identity of three unfamiliar children in our midst, and welcome them by name next week.   In what ways might we give attention to those who have seemingly no influence or ability to welcome us back?  I would suggest that this is the meaning of the child on Jesus’ lap.   \\nThis is a strange kind of wisdom, I must admit.  But in this one household scene, Jesus drives to the heart of servanthood.  There is nothing sentimental or whimpy about it.   “Welcome the ones who are not great.” I think this is one of the most difficult parts of Jesus message.  The Kingdom of God welcomes the ones that society does not.  This is the counter-cultural and controversial work we are called to do.  God’s gracious wisdom sees value in those on the bottom of the pile.   May we go and do likewise.  Amen.  ',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\n\\tFeeding 5000 people from a young boy’s lunch.  Walking out across the heaving waves on an inland sea in the middle of a wind storm.  Biblical miracles are difficult things to talk about.  They strain our thinking, for one thing.  Our scientific worldview gets challenged when we are confronted with stories of extra-ordinary things happening, in the Bible or in our daily lives.  What we would call a “premodern” mind might be impressed, even convinced of God’s existence and Jesus’ power, by such stories.  But the part of us that wants to see and measure and calculate and prove, is not sure what to do with miracles…if they even exist at all.  The Bible is full of miraculous stories that seem to strain the brain: Red Seas parting to allow a rag-tag group of Jewish slaves to escape the Egyptian army. Women conceiving and bearing children in their 80’s and 90’s, or stranger still, pregnancy without sex. God talking out of a burning bush, a cloud of smoke, a flaming pillar. Jesus of Nazareth turning water into wine, walking on water, healing sick people, bringing the dead back to life, coming back from the dead himself.  I tell you, these events are a puzzlement to many of us.  Events and acts that defy the laws of physics as we know them, and leave us wondering “Do I have to believe these miracles happened to be a Christian.  Is my relationship with God a sham, is my faith, inferior if I don’t’ believe these stories to be literal descriptions of something that happened?  Are these stories in any sense true?”\\n\\tIt is difficult for us to understand how people viewed the world 2000 years ago in Jesus time and further back before him.    Imagine living in a world where “nature” is not a closed system that God has to somehow “interrupt” supernaturally to make anything happen.  Imagine a world that simply functions each day because God wills it to be so and is active within this world every moment.   God’s extraordinary and extravagant actions happening each day, in each interaction with other humans, animals, plants, the whole of creation.  All suffused in the mystery of God’s workings.   Like the moisture laddened thickness we feel on a hot humid summer day, for people in Bible times, the air was thick with God.  Permeated with the spirit world, with forces of good and evil, full of angelic hosts and God’s glory.  Strange for us to imagine.  \\n\\tElizabeth Barrett Browning, the 19th century poet speaks to this intermingled world of the premodern mind.  Dividing things up into distinct, separate, logical pieces may be a mistake, she seems to suggest.   She begins her poem “Aurora Leigh” from which our Time of Centering is taken today:  \\n\\tTruth, so far, in my book; - the truth which draws\\n\\tThrough all things upwards, - that a twofold world \\n\\tmust go to a perfect cosmos.  Natural things \\n\\tAnd spiritual, - who separates those two\\n\\tIn art, in morals, or the social drift\\n\\tTears up the bond of nature and brings death,\\n\\tPaints futile pictures, writes unreal verse,\\n\\tLeads vulgar days, deals ignorantly with men.\\n\\tIs wrong, in short, at all points.\\nDividing up the spiritual and the natural somewhat simplifies the intent of Enlightenment thinking and the scientific revolution, to be sure.  But Barrett Browning is spot-on when she pushes us to consider that “earth is crammed with heaven.”   And I think this is part of what the Gospel writer John is doing as he recounts these two stories.  \\n\\tBut miracles weren’t really surprising to first century people; in Jesus’ time there were lots of healers and wonder workers.    What was new was how Jesus used miracles to help people better understand the heart of God. The Kingdom of God does not work like the Kingdom of the Empire, where power and money, appearance and possessions, strength and violence, rule the day .   This Kingdom of God, God’s reign, is like this….like these happenings in these ordinary parts of life:  wheat, weeds, mustard seeds, yeast, someone’s sack lunch.  Where small things bring big changes; where God’s economy, way of dealing with the world, is one of abundant compassion, not scarcity and judgement.\\n\\tCrowds of people had been following Jesus, records John; there is a yearning, a desperation in how they clamored after him that might be a bit off-putting to us.  They “saw the signs that Jesus was doing for the sick.”  They crowd around him as he teaches, 5000 men, probably twice that many women and children.   Everyone seems to have lost track of the time, but Jesus turns to his disciples and asks:  “what are we going to do about getting these people some food to eat?”  “Yikes,” says one of the disciples, “we just don’t have enough money for a project like that!”  Another disciples, speaks up, maybe even saracastically:  “Hey, this kid has some barley loaves and a few dried fish.  But, what are they among so many people?  This won’t make any difference!\\n\\t(Trygve Johnson is Chaplain at Hope College in Michigan).  One commentator blogging about this story writes:   So often we see a situation of need and we feel like we have nothing.  Nothing of worth to share, or so little that it seems ridiculous.  Other people have more talent, or more money, or more faith than we do.  Ours looks like just a pittance.  Why bother?   Yet God seems bent on giving by multiplying what little we have.  “Bring your nothing to me.  Be part of this. Come on now, get the people to sit down,” says Jesus.\\n\\tWe want to focus on the scarcity, and our worry that there will be even less in the future.  Over and over the Biblical message is that this is a God of abundance, and this God wants to multiply what we have.  “Bring your nothing to me,” says Jesus.  The disciples are asked to participate in the miracle, one where there will be not only enough for all these thousands of people, but there will a dozen huge baskets left over.\\n\\tSometimes we stand on the presence of a miracle unfolding in front of us.  Something starts to shift inside of us.  We start to see “common bushes afire with God,” and while its okay to “sit around and pluck blackberries” as the poet writes, we feel called to something else. Maybe a person starts to change or a situation takes an unexpected turn, new life is happening in front of us…. but we just freeze.  We can’t seem to find the way in….we can’t connect.  “But what are they among so many?” we wonder.  \\n\\tEugene Peterson, long-time local church pastor and author, describes this happening to him when his son announced that his young wife was pregnant with Peterson’s first grandchild.  Eugene and his wife jumped in the car and went to visit the young couple; his wife Jan was brimming with joy and expectation of this miracle of new life.   But Eugene felt oddly out-of-it.  Dull and flat.  As they drove home, he complained to Jan about his lack of emotion;  he even felt a bit irritated at her obvious excess of delight.  “What’s wrong with me:  Why don’t I feel anything? “ he demanded.  His wife answered, “perhaps it’s because you’ve never been pregnant.”  “Well, that’s just great; so what am I going to do about that?”   And his wife replied, “I suggest you build a cradle.”\\n\\tAfter mulling this idea around in his minds for a few days, Eugene trudged down to the public library and found pictures of cradles.  He choose an early American hooded cradle design, sketching the plans, going to a specialty wood shop, choosing some Hondorous mahogany.   In between pastoral calls and sermon writing, he would work on the cradle.  Measuring, cutting the wood, bit by bit.  When it was assembled he sanded over and over with the finest sand paper and steel wool,  inbetween applying coat after coat of tung oil.  And as he held that cradle and shaped and rubbed it, he found himself imagining the little baby growing inside his daughter-in-law. He found himself praying in wonder and gratitude for this developing child.  And he realized his wife’s suggestion had worked:  he himself was pregnant!   It was a miracle in itself!  He went from numb and uninvolved to being pregnant with anticipation and hope.  And by the time the cradle was ready, he was ready to fully receive that miracle of a new life.\\n\\tI suspect that the miracles are strewn at our feet everyday, mostly located in small insignificant things.  We trip over them, unnoticing.  Of we stumble upon them and don’t know how to respond.  God’s miraculous actions fill the air like thick humidity.   “I have nothing to contribute to this,” we groan.  “Bring me your nothing,” says Jesus.  “Get the people to sit down.” “I need you to participate here,” says the God of the Universe.  “Let’s see what we can do with your nothing.  Let’s turn it into a miracle of hope and compassion.”   \\n\\tWatch this week;  this world is thick with the God who invites us to participate in miracles.   Step right up; bring what little you have.  And watch it multiply!  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n(Story cited from: Eugene H. Peterson, Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places, p. 237-238) ',\n",
       " '\\tOur Exodus text and this story from Luke both have an other-worldly feel to them.  They describe mysterious scenes of encounters with the divine that may be, frankly, hard for us to imagine, much less believe. A story set in about 1500 years before Jesus’ time, while the Jewish people wander in the wilderness following escape form slavery in Egypt.  Their leader Moses’ luminous face lit from within after his encounter with God, requiring a veil so as to not frighten the people of Israel.  A story set in the first century of our CE:  Jesus retreats up a mountain with a few disciples for a time of prayer and he whole countenance transforms.  His robes turning a dazzling white; two famous people we know are already dead appear at his side.  My eyes reflexively squint as I try to imagine these unusual scenes.  God is portrayed as an awe-inspiring glory and over-whelming presence, coming through specific people. Even these human messagers take on super-human radiance.  We don’t usually see scenes like this except in B movies; how are we in the 21st century to engage these stories?  \\n\\tLast year on Transifguration Sunday, my sermon introduced you to the work of a contemporary theologian, John Ackerman, who has written about shifts in Christian spirituality in the last 50 years (“Listening to God: Spiritual Formation in Congregations,” by John Ackerman). I’m revisting his insights this morning, a year later into our interim time, because his description of two different types of Christian spirituality can help us understand these stories.  He also suggests some differences among different generations in many congregations, that may help us better understand some obstacles in your moving ahead together as a church community.  He identifies a spiritual shift in how people relate to God. \\n\\tAckerman writes:  “There has been a sea change in the past 50 years in the nature and character of Christian spirituality.  In the 1950’s, spirituality was centered in churches.  That was where one found God.  Churches were organized with top-down authority.  Scholars (and preachers) had more authority than laypeople, and the ordinary person in the pew found comfort in (the traditions and stability) of an institution.  The tectonic shift has moved us from spirituality found in a place of dwelling to spirituality experienced in a group of seekers.”   He calls the first way of finding God as “habitation spirituality.”  He goes on to describe how “habitation spirituality focuses on the God who has a sacred space in heaven and on earth in which humans can dwell (like a church).  Before the 1960’s this belief was the predominate expression of spirituality in America.  A ‘seeking spirituality,’ which arose in the 1960’s, (and the decades following) is characterized by knowing God on the journey rather than in houses of worship alone.…A seeking spirituality is focused not on a place so much as on the activity of search for meaning, journeying through life.  The new pattern accepts a great deal of diversity and choice.  At its worst, it is a shopping-mall mentality; at best, searching acknowledges that one style of spirituality does not fit at all.” \\n\\tIf I am understanding Ackerman correctly, one way of relating to God is encountering God in a place and another way to relating to is connected to encountering God on a journey, on the move. Neither is necessarily “right” or “wrong” way to connect with God; but we do see some breakdown along generational lines in these patterns of connecting with the Holy.  Ackerman notes that “both patterns are ancient,” as both habitation/dwelling spirituality and journey/seeking spirituality “can be found in the Bible.  Traditionally, dwelling spirituality constructs the Temple in Jerusalem and finds God in the Holy of Holies; seeking spirituality is found in the (journey through the) desert, in the words of the prophets.”   \\n\\tGod as “a mighty fortress,” “ the rock of ages,” the refuge to which we can flee:  are Biblical images which, rightfully so, both define and sustain us. \\nWhat Ackerman is suggesting is that this image of church alone, not going to sustain and challenge the enormous complexity, rapid changes and diversity of the 21st century world.\\n\\tConsider the Exodus story and the Israelites struggle’ to face the unknown as they traveled through the wilderness:  So often they longed for their previous lives, for their home in Egypt where life was not great but at least it was stable and predictable.   Jesus discipes, who were Invited to come up to this lonely mountain to pray, may have been in much the same emotional space.  They want to focus on the place. “Jesus, this is truly amazing!  You, Moses, Elijah.  It’s so good to be here; can’t we have a building campaign and just stay here with you?”\\n\\tPerhaps the disciples are getting a hint of what is coming next for Jesus at this point.  Who can blame them for wanting to build a permanent retreat center up there? It is midpoint in Jesus ministry and he has begun to talk with them about the fact that he is going to go to Jerusalem.  Going to the huge capital city even though his religious and political enemies are there.  Even though he will suffer at the hands of these authorities and be killed.   Like Israelites wandering in the wilderness, the disciples don’t really know when or where they will be led, and they are understandably nervous.  And when they get to this mountaintop scene, in all its glory, it will not be surprising that the disciples press for a new habitation, a place to memorialize.  They will yearn for a “dwelling spirituality,” as Ackerman would describe it.  Better to stay and commemorate a glorious past with shelters, booths to commemorate, to institutionalize, what they have seen:  Jesus astounding transfiguration along with the appearance of the Hebrew leader Moses and the prophet Elijah.   Jesus glowing radiant and bright, Moses there representing God’s law to the Jews and Elijah the Jewish prophetic tradition; all are right there with him, symbolizing the whole known Hebrew scripture in Jesus’ time.    “Rabbi,” cries Peter: “it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!”  \\n\\tBut a cloud overcomes them and they hear a voice: “This is my beloved son” – same words as after Jesus is baptized, but with an addition – “This is my Beloved, listen to him!”  And “suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.”  And immediately they are on the move again, following this one back into the teeming crowds, where they will immediately confront the forces of evil that are making a young child sick.  \\n\\tJesus would not let them stay there up on the Mountain.  God’s instructions?  Keep an ear open to “my beloved Son.”    “Listen” to him.  This may be the most important invitation the church offers to the world.   Come, we don’t give you all the answers, or a place to hide from the troubles of the world.  But we will journey with you as together we listen to Jesus.  Join us as we will search the scriptures, pay attention to the needs of the world, and prayerfully discern God’s leading together.  The challenge for any congregation is that our dwelling, our place, our rootedness in traditions together often become our primary focus.  Things like building repair are so tangible, so obvious.  Less obvious might be what our congregation might to about mounting gun violence in our communities, after studying the situation for the last month together as 8 of us did during January!  Where does God want us to move, to journey, as leaders of community safety, public well-being and as supporters of the individual right to responsibily possess and use a firearm?  This kind of out-there, journey-question is often less clear than crucial building maintainance….but is no less important in my view.  The tension between church being a safe haven and church being a disciple-ship school will always be there.   Today’s texts invite us down from tendency to “build booths,” to only memorize a beloved past.  As John Ackerman observes, “spiritual formation happens when individuals and congregations together can listen to God, obey God, and be transformed by God.”  \\n\\tAnd so we keep listening together as we enter this season of Lent, spiraling back around to this reflective period in the church year in yet a different place as a congregation.  Come party with us on Fat Tuesday; we will blow-it-out with fattening foods, music and fun. Then the mood will shift and we will end the evening in a brief ritual of affirming our human mortality with the ritual of receiving ashes on our foreheads or hands.  How blessed we are to be together in a church that is not just “building booths” to memorialize the mountain-top past but is moving bravely into God’s future together.   Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHow oddly fitting to hear these words of goodbye, on this our last Sunday as Interim Pastor and congregation.  I feel a similar sense of tenderness and poignancy as you and I worship together this morning.  I too want to declare, as Jesus did at that final supper with his friends and followers: “I still have many things to say you!”  I want to name all the courageous, hard, creative work we have done together since fall of 2014.  I want to stay and exhort you and push you further to be true seekers of God’s truth, to be brave servants of God’s hurting world, to fight for justice and to let yourselves be changed by God’s transforming, extravagant love for each of you!  But, Jesus was right…you couldn’t bear it in part because the service would go on for hours and hours and we would never get to the brats planned for lunch!  \\n\\tThese last two days I have been attending our MN Conference Annual meeting up at College of St. Benedict, joined by two Executive Board members Lynne Bradbury and Jacob Kenake.  Yesterday morning’s speaker was Rev. Julian DeShazier, a young hip-hop artist and Senior Pastor of University Church, UCC on the South Side of Chicago.  He described how one sign of “priviledge” in our society is “the ability to walk away” from a situation of injustice.  If we are educated, have light skin, are not likely to be killed in our streets, have access to adequate healthcare and jobs, we can walk away from situations that are unjust.  “But,” continued Rev. DeShazier, “again and again, the United Church of Christ is known as the people who have decided to stay.”  As I look over our years together, I have seen you more and more willing to “stay” when it comes to tough church issues and perplexing problems of social injustice in the surrounding community.  You didn’t have to invite the greater metro area, along with the press, into your Sanctuary after Philando Castile was killed, nor hold forums through last fall on community policing and implicit bias.  You didn’t have to gather in small groups to explore the painful reality of white priviledge. You could have walked away when the City of FH asked you to host the open-to-the-public policing task-force meetings.  You could walk away from trying to figure out what kind of Service of Prayer and Recommitment you might hold this July, in recognition of one year of hard work since Mr. Castille’s, as well as continued community brokenness, anger and demands for justice.  You could walk away from reaching out to people different from you, who live in situations radically different than yours.   But God’s Spirit of truth about God’s vision of justice, mercy and abundance for all appears to be leading you to stay.   And oh how I would love to stay with you as you continue to be a strong moral voice in this community, and as you continue to reach across lines that divide and exclude people.  \\n\\tPerhaps the reason Jesus told his disciples, “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear it now,” was because he understood the power of emotion, the overwhelm of impending loss, the stunned sadness that his followers were feeling at the thought of loosing him.   Not that I’m Jesus….but I think we share in some of those feelings this morning. Jesus reassured his people that “the Spirit of truth” would come to them and guide them in all truth. And so for us: Even in the midst of transitions and changes that are unsettling and make us anxious. Once again, we find Jesus grappling with simple words that describe a great mystery:  this aspect of the divine that has been present at the beginning of creation, God’s spirit, God’s breath, that moved over the watery chaos. This Spirit, this Comforter and Advocate as Jesus described it, surrounding and within all of us.  Guiding us, like a conduit for God’s word of truth.  How might we imagine this possibility so that it energizes us, gives us renewed vision and hope for the future?  \\n\\tSometimes I see in my mind’s eye billions of thin filaments like fiber-optic cable, running from God to each of us and between us, weaving a web of sparking connection among all things.  Sometimes I imagine a vast cloud, an ether, filled with particles of insight, flowing between God to humans.  A relational network: humming, vibrating, connecting us.  Crackling energy of a relational community of God, within God the Creator, Jesus the son and the Holy Spirit. \\n\\tAbout 600 years ago, a Russian Orthodox monk named Andrei Rublev tried to visualize this reality of what has come to be called the Holy Trinity.  He created a special kind of painting known as an icon for his fellow monks, during a time of great political unrest, violence and danger in their native land.  Rublev was aware that amidst the turmoil and fear of their times, words were failing him and his fellow monks.  The monks under his charge just could not bear to hear more words. As Richard Rohr describes this icon in his book about the Trinity, The Divine Dance:  If we are visually able, when words fail us and feelings overwhelm us, we can still see.  We can still gaze.   \\n\\tToday amidst the uncertainty in each of our lives, the future of this church, the future of our nation and its leadership, the future of the safety and sanity of this planet, in the midst of all of this, I invite you to gaze with me.  There is a reproduction of Rublev’s icon on the front page of our Order of Service.   Icons are created for us to look through, like a window.  A window through which we can encounter the divine.  As we gaze, we allow our thinking to quiet and our awareness to slowly drop into a deeper heart knowing.  Rublev invited his fellow monks to look through his icon to gaze upon the reality of the Holy Trinity.  \\n\\tLet your eyes wander over these three beings in this icon.  Their long, lean bodies suggest male figures but their faces might be those of identical sisters.   Each figure has wings, robes of differing colors, and is holding a thin staff, as if to suggest they are each on a journey.  Yet they are seated around a table-like structure, with some kind of bowl or chalice between them.   Who are they?  People? Angels?  Rublev knew the story of the early Jewish patriarch and matriarch, Abraham and Sarah.  In the Book of Genesis, we learn that God had led them out of their homeland, with a promise God’s presence, of land and offspring.  But in their old age the couple remained childless.   One day, Abraham notices three strangers – angels? – approaching their tents near the oak of Mamre.  He invites them to table, where the couple feeds them, as one does with the unexpected sojourner in one’s midst.  The mysterious strangers have a message for the couple:  you are going to have a child.  What Rublev noticed in the Biblical story is that at this point Abraham starts to address the three messengers as a single entity – as Lord.  God in three persons?   Rublev paints this scene of the three angelic messengers, gathered around the table sharing a meal, as a symbol of three-in-one: the Holy Trinity of God as Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.   Three divine beings, hanging out with one another.\\n\\tNotice how the three figures incline their heads, almost submissively, to one another.  Their eyes are on oneanother  No imperial attitudes here, but a sense of gentle, attentive, “engagement of the three with each other, the joining of eyes.”  (p. 133)  Tender affection between the different aspects of God.  Relational energy of both love and curiosity moving between them.  For Rublev, the figure on the left represents God the Creator, heavenly parent, dressed in an almost irredescent flowing robe.  In the center is Jesus, with dense colors of blue and red, his two outstretched fingers signifying both his human and divine nature.  And to the right, the Holy Spirit, outfitted in earthy, life-giving green.  In the distance, a house, a tree and a mountain all lending significance to the spiritual journey.  I am drawn in as I gaze on this icon….for a reason.  Art historians note that “the three figures are not part of a disappearing plane, with a vanishing point in the distance, but rather seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  (p. 133).\\n\\tAh, that is it!  There is a fourth figure in this circle of attentive gazing, and that is the viewer.  It is you.  It is me.  The three figures “seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  We are at the table with these three, declared Rublev, we are part of this circle of attentiveness, of quietly animated interaction.  We are part of this exchange of mutual knowing and loving. One of my seminary professors, the Catholic theologian Henry Nouwen, put it this way: he writes that during a difficult period in his life, “in which verbal prayer had become nearly impossible and during which mental and emotional fatigue had made me the easy victim of feelings of despair and fear, a long and quiet presence to this icon became the beginning of my healing.  As I sat in front of Rublev’s Trinity, I noticed how gradually my gaze became a silent prayer….my inner restlessness melted away and lifted me up into the circle of love, a circle that could not be broken by the powers of the world.”  Nouwen called this “living in the house of love.”   (Behold the Beauty of the Lord: Praying with Icons, by Henry Nouwen, p. 21).\\n\\tMay you take your place at this table.  May you know your place in this house of love, filled with the vibrant, crackling energy of God the Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.  This will give you the inspiration, the energy to keep taking risks.  It will allow you to continue to be a church that does not walk away.  May you keep deciding to stay.  May you keep finding community partners who care about working with you to fight social injustice.  Blessings on your unfolding ministries of peace and mercy.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n\\n\\t\\n\\nJohn 16:12-15\\n12“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.13When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.\\xa014He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\\xa015All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\\n \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\\n\\tHow did busy-ness become a badge of honor?  “Hi, how are you?” we ask a friend.  “Oh, wow…I’m so busy!” comes the reply.  Like responsible adults who can run many shows at once, it took me years to recognize how, in my busy-ness, I juggled my attention out of the present moment.  I had a friend who would listen calmly as I bemoaned by packed weekly calendar.  Instead of replying, “oh yes, I know just what you mean…you should see my schedule….” she started talking about toast.  ‘In the morning,” she explained, “I sometimes have to ask myself….am I eating my toast?”  “Or,” she continued more slowly, “Am. I. Eating. My. Toast?”  It took me a few moments to get what she was talking about:  The contrast between inhaling a quick breakfast or paying attention to the crunch and crumbs of this one piece of toasted bread….the miracle of food, sustenance in a world where many people have no breakfast….tactile sensation of the gift of nourishment, in this one precious moment.  \\n\\t\\n\\tI remember feeling a bit annoyed, gently chastised even, as I listened to my friend.  I had to acknowledge that at that point in my life, I seldom was fully present in the present moment.  Not only was I missing things in my distractedness, like the taste and texture of my breakfast.   I was also losing a sense of connectedness with the people and natural world around me.  Even subtler, was the fact that I was losing a sense of God’s presence, of God’s active agency, in my life.  As a pastor, I still talked about God, preached about God; but there was an extended period where I lost track of being a co-partner with God in daily life.   “That’s okay, God, I’ve got things covered!” were my quick prayers,  “I’ll call you if I need you!”  \\n\\t\\n\\tThis is a huge challenge for most of us:  to give God and God’s workings among us the attention God deserves.  I think of my friend’s words about focusing on her morning toast, some three decades later now as I read this wedding banquet story in the Book of Matthew.  What is there in this rather curious and grisly parable for us this morning? \\n\\t\\n\\tContext is important here as we dive into this text.  Jesus tells this strangely exaggerated and provocative story to a group of religious leaders who are debating whether to arrest him.  Jesus has already indirectly criticized them with his parables and teachings about God’s extravagant acceptance of all people.  ‘Here it is again, folks,” I can imagine Jesus saying to his critics, “Here’s another picture of what the Kingdom of God, God’s reign of compassion and justice among us, is all about.”  But these leaders, the scholarly Pharisees and temple priest Sadducees, maintain Jesus is challenging their authority to guide the religious life of the Jewish people.  We could dismiss these leaders as misguided, acting rigid, like conservative “old guard.”  But they are trying to conserve a tradition for which they are responsible.  These leaders are seeking to protect a community, one that is precariously situated under the thumb of the oppressive Roman regime.  \\t\\n\\nWisely or not, Jesus tells them this story:  A King is planning an extravagant wedding feast for his son, and sends his servants out to invite all the important people in town.  One Biblical commentator on this passage compared this to being invited to dinner at the White House, or the wedding of British royalty (Daniel Clendendin, “Journey with Jesus” blog, Sunday 10/2/14). Even if you didn’t vote for our current leader, or you think British royalty is irrelevant, you probably would readily accept an invitation such as this.  But the invited guests in this story refuse the invitation.  The King is astounded and tries again:  “We’ve prepared an extravagant feast, the band is set-up, it’s going to be a great party, please come!”  But now, the guests “make light” of the wedding banquet invitation and head off to focus on their families, their farms, their businesses.  Not only that, but they decide to kill the messengers who came to invite them.  \\n\\nThe King is really ticked-off, murder and mayhem ensures, and his army destroys the town. Given Jesus’ conflict with the religious leaders of his day, one might wonder if this isn’t this a thinly veiled reference to their refusal to welcome his message and ministry.  The invitees in the story are busy with other things.  “Well,” says the King, “I’ll just go ahead and invite anyone who is out there on the streets, the good and the bad!”  But if you are trying to preserve a community, as these leaders were tasked, you need to weed out the bad, corrupting forces.\\n\\t\\n\\tNotice that the first set of guests refuse to come not because they are wicked, but because they “make light” of the invitation.  They are focused on other things.   Not evil things, but they are preoccupied with everyday concerns like their home, their family, their business.  Life can be pretty distracting on a day-to-day basis, that’s for sure.  Our responsibilities at home, health issues, our paid or volunteer work, things going on at church, not to mention rapidly changing news of our wider community and the rest of the world.  Where is our focus most of the time?  In telling the story, Jesus was concerned with how humans get distracted from God’s Kingdom business and miss out on the banquet of life God sets before them.  We miss the invitation to actually partner with that generous spirit of the living God.   \\n\\t\\n\\tCould it be that you and I are being invited, on a daily basis, into an awareness of grace and abundance that seems so overwhelming, that we make light of it?  We focus our attention and our anxieties on the pressing demands of the everyday, and on our fears about the future.    So, one question for us from the text might be:  where is my focus these days?  What do I spend the most time thinking about, mulling over, perhaps grinding over, even obsessing over?  In our private lives, what is our focus?  In your lives together as a congregation, what is your focus?  Past? Present? Future? What does our language focus around?  \\n\\t\\n\\tPaul’s letter to the Philippians throws a challenge to our focusing, to where our attention goes:  “Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice.”  How might our language keep us focused on the negative, on lamenting instead of rejoicing?  “Us” and “Them.”  “Old Guard” and “New People.”   “Pastor X Supporters” and “Pastor Y Supporters.”   “It’s all about rejoicing,” says Paul, “that’s where you need to focus.”\\n\\t\\n\\tIt occurs to me that “rejoicing” may be a choice.  If I wait for a warm, cozy feeling of contentment or happiness to emerge, I may stay stuck.  What invitations to deeper living are coming towards me?  Opportunities for cultivating gratefulness?  I look and see what is around me, and I start to notice…. Restrictive marriage laws are crumbling around the country, even in places like the Commonwealth of Virginia this week, and the State of North Carolina.  Rejoice!  Our family friends Matt and Joss got legally married yesterday afternoon in Maine.  Again, I say rejoice!  People got up early this morning and gathered with our church Treasurer to learn more about the financial well being of this congregation.  Faith formation programs during the hour before worship are being re-shaped and re-vitalitized for all ages, and begin next Sunday at 9:30!  Rejoice and give thanks!\\n\\t\\n\\tJesus does add an extra punch at the end of this story.  One guest shows up at the banquet without proper wedding attire and the host is outraged.  The King tosses the ill-clothed guest out into “outer darkness.”  Well, that seems pretty harsh; are fancy clothes a pre-requisite for being included in God’s reign of welcome and mercy?  I don’t think so.  Again using bizarre exaggeration, Jesus is reminding his listeners that while all are invited into God’s Kingdom, the demands of discipleship are great.  We need to be prepared, to show up in the right clothes for the job of being Christ’s disciples, to give our attention to the choices and actions he calls us to do in this moment.   \\n\\t\\n\\tI have an old work-shirt with paint all over it and some crummy stained work gloves that I put on for yard work and other messy chores.  Some desk-job people put on a snappy suit for tough clients; we wear sensible walking shoes for running a lot of errands or going sightseeing.  Might it also help to properly “dress” our attitudes and our attention as we move through our day as God’s Kingdom partners?   Could an attitude of “rejoicing” be the clothing we should wear as we go about partnering with God?  How might we each pay attention to how we clothe our minds and attitudes this week?\\n\\nWhat invitations to shared understanding and reconciliation might be emerging for us in this congregation?  God’s invitation to a feast of welcome, of hopefulness, has been issued.  How will we each respond? Paul is sitting in jail in Rome as he writes this!   But Paul is suggesting an important strategy here that it is like getting into the right clothes for the day’s project at hand.  He offers this advice: “stand firm in the Lord” and “rejoice in the Lord always.”   Grab on to the deep joy.  Put your attention on rejoicing.  This attention, this choosing, has the power to change us.   Accept the invitation; don’t miss this party.  Watch out for making light of God’s gifts, God’s extravagant generosity, God’s daily invitation.  “Stand firm in the Lord; rejoice, again I say, rejoice.” Amen.  \\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThis last week 57 children joined 36 Immanuel adults in youth in Vacation Bible School.  Songs, Bible readings, craft projects, wild and crazy games.  All centered around the idea that we can soar as high as the sky in our lives, if only we will trust God.  What does it mean to trust God?\\n\\tGod created families and community to help us learn about trusting.  As babies we learn to trust our mom or dad or a helper will come and take care of us even before we have words to ask for help.  Over and over we cry, and someone who loves us shows up to feed us, change us, comfort us.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tStory of learning how to ride a bike:  I’m not sure how old I was when I learned how to ride a bike.  But I remember which house I lived in: a brick house in northern Virginia during one of the times my dad was stationed at the Pentagon.  I remember climbing up on my first two-wheeler with the training wheels.  Didn’t both hit the ground at the same time, wobbly.  I was happy riding around the my suburban block on that bike.  I could stop and I didn’t fall over.  But my friends were on two-wheelers without training wheels and I noticed they could go faster, they could turn corners more sharply.  They were leaving me in the dust.\\n\\tOne Saturday my dad asked if I was ready to take off the training wheels.  “I’ll hold you at your seat, and run along besides you, so you won’t fall over.”  I was pretty wary, but we took off the training wheels.  “I’ll be right here, you can trust me,” said my dad.  And with my dad steadying me I did just fine.  I trusted he would be there.  I could lean into his presence and his hands and pedel like mad.  The next day, Dad said, “let’s see if you can pedel without me holding on.”  Oh!  I was horrified!  Then I realized my dad couldn’t hold my bike and run after me forever.  We started out again, with dad running down the block holding my seat as I pedeled hard and fast.  Wow, I was doing great.  I forgot about him letting go.  Wheeeee!  I was really moving!  I came to a stop at the end of the block, and turned around.  No Dad!  He had let go!  Well, he was there, but he was way down the block smiling and waving.  “Yaaaay!  You did great!  I just couldn’t keep up with you, you were moving so fast!  I had to let-go!”  My dad trusted my ability even before I could trust it.  I had leaned into his help and he leaned into my growing bike competence!\\n\\tLater when I taught my children how to ride a two-wheeler, I found it really hard to let go of that bike seat.  It was tough to trust that they were going to be okay.  I remember some rough crashes, scrapped knees, a few tears.  I had to lean into their growing up, I had to trust them and let-go.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWhen we become grown-ups, these are two of the hardest things to do with other people:  letting ourselves lean on and ask for help from other people. Being able to let-go of control at times.   I love the hint that the apostle Paul gives us in this passage from Ephesians today:\\n\\t\\tBe imitators of God!\\n\\n\\tHow can you and I imitate God?  Live in love, as Christ loved us, says Paul.  And a huge part of living in love is trusting each other.  Leaning into each other; letting go and not always being in control.\\n\\n\\tIt also occurs to me that God trusts us.  God doesn’t control us; go doesn’t hold on to the back of our bicycle seats or manipulate us like puppets.  God leans into us with trusting love, sending us Jesus Christ to teach us how to love.  God lets go, allowing us to do good or evil, trusting/hoping that we will make the right choices with our lives.  That’s the other part isn’t it?  God trusts US.  We are partners in this.  We can trust God, because God trusts us to imitate God, to live in love.\\n\\n\\tThis week, see where you can let someone else help you; lean into them, lean into God’s presence.  See where you can let-go of controlling things, or worrying about control.  Watch how God lets go and lets you make choices.  In all things, we can trust this God who trusts us.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tToday’s scripture reading from Luke raises some perplexing questions about the responsibilities and rights of all of us, the expectations of us as followers of Jesus.  To put it bluntly, are we supposed to be raising people from the dead, like Jesus did?  This is one challenging story we just heard.  When the Wednesday Bible study group and I finished reading it out loud earlier this week, we looked at each other and simply said “wow…..what on earth do we make of this?”  Two different crowds of people approach a city gate in first century Palestine.  A large group of disciples and followers of Jesus, headed into town.  A large assembly of mourners, headed out of town to the place of burial.   Before attempting to believe this story, let’s see if we can first imagine it. \\n\\n\\tTall columns define the city gate and people are trying to push through the narrow opening.  Voices clamoring, hot sun, swirling dust and sweat and animal smells fill the air.  “Hey, what’s the slow-down,” someone yells.  People jostling straining to see what is going on.  And in the silent vortex of all the commotion: a grieving widow who has lost her only son.   That must be her child, the dead man, being carried on a funeral bier.  Can we see the mother’s tear-stained face in our mind’s eye?  Jesus notices her immediately.  A word about widows in this culture:  besides orphans and maybe lepers, there was no group more disenfranchised and marginalized than widows in ancient society and in some parts of the world today.  In a patriarchal culture, if your husband dies, you and your belongings are placed under the “protection” of his brothers.  If your brother-in-law dies, you can keep your land and home only if you have a son who will inherit them.  It’s no wonder that prophets throughout Israel’s history would judge the nation and the King’s leadership based on how well they actually cared for widows and orphans.  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe woman has not only has lost much; she is lost. Jesus apparently reads all of this in a flash and is overwhelmed with compassion.  But his next move is so unexpected that the pallbearers skid to a halt, and stand frozen in disbelief.  Breaking an important purity law of the day, Jesus touches the bier carrying the dead son, calling out: “Young man, I say to you, rise!”   \\n\\n\\tThis is the same Jesus who, weeks before, had enraged his home synagogue congregation with references to the breaking in of God’s reign and justice.  Why were they angry?  He referenced the prophet Elijah resurrecting a dead body some 800 years earlier: a child of a Gentile widow.  Ancient Hebrew prophets spoke truth to power of their day and also healed heal people on the margins of the community.  Jesus’ synagogue listeners felt insulted by his implication that they do not care for the widows and the marginalized.  They tried and run him out of town and off a cliff.  \\n\\n\\tBut provocative Jesus is at it again, enacting in front of this huge crowd the prophetic signs of the in-breaking of God’s reign:  the blind receiving sight, the lame walking, the lepers cleansed, the deaf hearing, the poor hearing good news and the dead being raised.  Suddenly we have an alive formerly dead son, one startled mother and a stunned crowd of on-lookers.  Everyone is pretty freaked-out by this turn of events.  Jesus is proclaimed a prophet and word about him spreads throughout the region.\\n\\n\\t But really?  Dead people coming alive again?  Full disclosure: your pastor does not know how to raise people from the dead.  My pastoral care training in seminary did not include a course on “Raising the Dead 101.”    And believe me, there have been several occasions in the last few months where I sorely wished I possessed this spiritual gift. For many of us here today, we have personal stories of miracles that did not happen, of cures that were not found, of damage that was, in the end, not undone.  Experiencing this disappointment and sorrow in our lives and those of others, how do we make sense of Biblical stories like this? \\n\\n\\tBiblical scholar and United Church of Christ theologian, Walter Bruggemann, has written extensively about the Hebrew prophets.  He describes how the prophets’ essential challenge to those in power was that things could be “otherwise.”  I wonder if this is how new life and renewed hope takes seed in our hearts.  We hear or see, or are pushed towards a new possibility in our lives.  Perhaps it is something that was unimaginable before that moment, and we see that things can be “otherwise,” that something in the mess is being resurrected.   Something might shift in how we picture God.  Perhaps we begin to imagine an alive compassionate God who is more interested in healing than in deadening punishment.  Or, stuck in our despair, and feeling cynical about things ever changing, we may catch a glimpse of a decisively different way that things might turn out.   We engage it.  Resurrection living.\\n\\n\\tI attended a meeting of some local churches and public school principals the other day, sponsored by a group called Sheridan Story.  This nonprofit organization partners with community groups to provide supplemental weekend food for kids with limited family income.  Our church now sponsors three such students each week at Falcon Heights Elementary School down the block, and we’ve been collecting cereal and snacks to also tuck in the weekend backpacks.  At this meeting, the school principal, Beth Benkhe, told us that they had a history at her school of canned food drives to support local food shelves.  Last year, at the end of the food drive, a young student approached her and quietly asked, “may I take a few cans home to my family for the weekend?”  All of a sudden, Principal Beth began to imagine “otherwise.”  How could kids from her neediest families have more food through the weekends?  I would call this resurrection thinking on her part.   She imagined what might be “otherwise.”\\n\\n Bruggemann notes (Testimony to Otherwise: The Witness of Elijah and Elisha), that in healing the widow’s child, the prophet Elijah “enacts otherwise, showing that the world could be and would be different, concretely, decisively different.” A world where marginalized widows and their sick sons are provided for with food and community. He notes that it is no surprise that Jesus reminded his followers of the stories of Elijah:  “When the early church pondered Jesus,” writes Bruggemann, “cadences of Elijah rang in their ears, because they sensed that Jesus was an enactment of a dangerous, healing, liberating otherwise that could not be stopped.”  Bruggemann challenges us “to reconstrue our own lives out beyond the closed definitions we have too long inhaled.”   Don’t “accept the given,” he enjoins us; “seek otherwise.” (p. 27)\\n\\n\\tIn our story from Luke, we see Jesus also taking a huge risk, this time of ritual impurity and rebuke, as he reaches out to touch the body of the dead man. The prophet Elijah healed through fervent prayer and full-body physical touch.  In Luke’s telling, Jesus heals with mere words: the command to rise. The similarity of Elijah’s healing with Jesus’ dramatic act is not lost on these two different crowds colliding at the city gates.  The young man is up and talking.  Awe and fear seizes the on-lookers; “they glorified God, saying, ‘A great prophet has risen among us!’ and ‘God has looked favorably on his people!’”  \\n\\nI suggest we watch for God’s “otherwise” this week.  Be on the alert for that alternate vision of how things might be, close by and far away.  This is resurrection living, where we accept both the right and the responsibility as followers of Jesus to help bring about transformed people and changed communities.  Yes, life alternates between joy and sadness, gain and loss.  But how might we each practice resurrection, new life, together? Our’s is to give testimony to the otherwise:  to God’s saving, healing possibilities. Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIn Jesus view, these leaders taught with the authority of Moses, the great Jewish leader who brought Israel out of Egypt and through the wilderness to the Promised Land.  But some of these leaders would not practice what they preached, and imposed purity laws and ritual requirements that were burdensome for everyday people.  The 5-6th century BCE Jewish prophets railed against abuses of their Temple priests: ornate vestments, privileged places among at the wealthy people’s banquet tables, ignoring the poor and the widows. And down through Christian history we have seen far too many outward signs of religious pomp, privilege and immunity from being held accountable when abusing the trust of the clerical office.  A lot of fancy cowboy “hat” but not much “cattle,” not enough down-to-earth action of helping normal people lift the everyday burdens of their lives.  \\n\\n\\tThere does seem to be something about power in general that has a tenacious capacity to corrupt.  But many everyday people don’t feel real powerful in their lives.  How do this humility language and the call to be a servant impact us if we are not on the top of the heap?   And I wonder what humility is supposed to look like in our predominate culture where we focus on instilling self-esteem and a sense of pride in our children?  We speak publically of taking pride in our community and country.  Where does humility fit for us as Christians?\\n\\n\\tI discovered some reflections on this passage by a man named Richard Beck this week.  He is the head of the psychology department down at Abilene Christian University.  Professor Beck has a special interest in how psychology and Christian theology intersect.  He is particularly intrigued by how people experience personal empowerment but also remain humble in their leadership.  He blogs at “Political Theology Today” about a certain experiment that recently caught his attention: it’s called “the cookie experiment.”  The researchers were exploring how personal power affects our own sense of entitlement, what we think we deserve in a certain situation.\\n\\tDifferent groups of either all-male or all-female participants “were asked to discuss various political issues and make policy recommendations,” writes Beck. “One of the three participants was given the role of “judge” and asked to assign points rating the quality of the recommendations made by the other two participants. This placed the judge in a “high power” position relative to the other two. About thirty minutes into the discussion the experimenter brought the three participants five cookies on a plate. And the number of cookies was carefully chosen. Five cookies. Three people. Someone isn’t getting a second cookie. Who would that be?”\\n\\n\\tAs the researchers watched from behind their one-way mirror, they noticed that the person who had been given the role of “judge” was much more likely to take that last extra cookie!  Those participants, whose policy recommendations were being rated, were less likely to grab a second cookie.  And, I love this part; this “high-power position” participant also was more likely to chew with his or her mouth open and to leave crumbs strewn across the table!\\n\\t“Power affects us,” notes Richard Beck as he discussed these findings.  “Power tempts us to take more cookies for ourselves. And power tempts us to leave messes for others to clean up.”  Jesus was on to something: a position of leadership can distort our sense of accountability.  Besides affecting our relationship with others (we get greedy, loose manners and get a tad sloppy), I have a hunch it also affects how we relate with God.\\n\\tIt’s easy to see how powerful corporations or powerful nations are tempted to take more “cookies” than their share.  More “cookies” of profit, resources, land, money for themselves.  And we see them leaving a lot of messes, including environmental disasters, ethnic cleansing and racial genocide, for others to clean up.  And I am sure among this congregation we could have some interesting debate about how our own nation and the US corporations that exert such power in the world have, or have not, taken too many of the “cookies.”\\n\\tWhat is more difficult for us to look at however, is our own self.  How do we recognize the power that we each wield, perhaps by education or income, by intelligence or life experience, by our gender or age, by our skin color, even by our sexual orientation?  We each may be in more “high places” as Jesus describes, than we know.  What does it mean for Jesus to call us to humility in the “high places” of privilege that we might experience in the church?  From the “high place” of being a long time member of the church?  From the “high place” of having served in various leadership positions, from being a large donor, from having put a lot of hours into the kitchen or repairing the building or teaching in the Sunday School or going on repeated youth trips or singing in the choir for years?   These “high places,” personal ones and ones we experience in the church together, give us a certain power.   And “power affects us,” says Richard Beck. “Power tempts us to take more cookies for ourselves. And power tempts us to leave messes for others to clean up.”   I think it also tempts us to think we are the deciders in our lives, and that we don’t need to bother busy God for insight or direction….as individuals and as a congregation. \\n\\tI don’t think this means we are to step away from positions of power and influence in our lives.  But we may need to watch carefully how we spend the “currency” that we have from being in these positions.  How are we going to share the cookies and not leave a mess?   How do I continue to partner with God in the choices that I make?\\n\\tAfter describing the “cookie experiment” to his students, Professor Beck gave them a challenge.   Of course we each want to think about how to act less entitled, how we each metaphorically might grab fewer “cookies” and clean up after ourselves.  But Professor Beck had something else in mind:  How might we “exalt, lift up and elevate the humblest servants.”  He looked out over his university class and asked:  “who cleans the bathrooms in this building?”   Who takes out the garbage?   No one had an answer.  They began to discuss how every organization has people in the “lowest levels of the power hierarchy, those already working in overlooked roles.”  The class decided to call the custodial company and find out the name of the cleaners, and then they passed the hat to give them thank you gifts at Christmastime.\\n\\tProfessor Beck concluded his blog by noting that before we can care about someone, we have to actually see him or her.  “Here is my hope in all this. After graduation, wherever my students find themselves, I’d like for them to exalt the humble, to lift up the servants. But to do this they have to train themselves to see the humble and to see the servants. Because they are awfully hard to spot, these unseen people.  My hope is that such training causes my students, in some future bathroom in their workplace, to be interrupted by the thought: ‘someone cleans this toilet. Should I not know his or her name?’  That interruption is my hope. Because such questions make the invisible visible. Such questions begin to exalt the humble. Such questions begin to lift up the servants.  And such questions, I hope, begin to give us pause when we want to take another cookie.”\\n\\tPerhaps this is the challenge, and where we are continual students in humility: letting our assumptions be interrupted.  Our assumptions about our own entitlement, our assumptions that we go it alone and don’t need God to be our inner GPS.  Perhaps we can watch for the interruptions this week, those small reminders that the extra cookie isn’t necessarily ours, the reminder to mind our manners, the reminder to clean up the messes we make.  The reminder that other humble people make much of our everyday work-a-day world run smoothly.  May we be students of humility this week, schooled by these interruptions of our assumptions.  Amen.\\n(“” on Richard Beck’s blog - Political Theology Today)\\n',\n",
       " 'Gracious, what iN the world are we to make of this?  Clearly, scripturally speaking, the first Sunday in Advent is not about a run up to the nativity stories.  It’s about a wider, cosmic coming of the Lord, whatever this is supposed to mean.   I suppose we can’t be blamed for wanting to avoid these parts of the Bible and to move on to the tender Birth narratives; it’s the Christmas season, already!  But on the tail end of the Thanksgiving holiday, filled with groaning tables, Black Friday sales pitches and endless football, we are invited to begin the Advent season.  Once again, this incongruous sense of inhabiting two worlds as we run-up to Christmas.  But through the years I have found the themes and practices of Advent to offer a more steady guide to following the Jesus Way than Christmas itself.  When I struggle with how to both live in this chaotic and unpredictable world and how to survive spiritually, I find endless instruction in the Advent season.\\nBut in these apocalyptic readings? This kind of Biblical writing has certainly been misunderstood and misappropriated through the centuries.  One can dismiss apocalyptic talk as the domain of misguided Bible literalists.  We might find ourselves perplexed, even repulsed, by Christian fundamentalists who join ultra-Orthodox Jews at Jerusalem’s Western Wall, anticipating the dramatic return of the Messiah in full battle gear and the rapture, wisking away, of the believers. \\n\\tBut he word “apocalypse” actually means ‘uncovering’ or ‘revealing’ the real truth hidden beneath the surface.  It has a lot less to do with the Hollywood film visions of exploding cities and massive casualties. such writings first appear in Jewish writings around the 2nd century BCE, originating with the Book of Daniel.  Written during times of political upheaval and societal fear, like the Book of Revelations in last first century CE, these kind of writings are filled with visions of cosmic turmoil and earthly destruction.  According to the Biblical scholar Robert Corin Morris (“Apolcalypse Fever: The Perennial Return of the End Times,” p. 40, Weavings, XXI:6) their allegorical, mythical images are meant to reveal God’s mysterious workings that lie beneath troubling current events. The visions are meant to expose “the inadequacy of present structures to deal constructively with human life,” notes Morris.  “Human institutions (that are failing) as the consequences of social and personal sin, now boil over and people suffer.  The threat of turmoil and destruction to come is real” but just as real is God’s “persistent working” behind the scenes to bring God’s domain of righteousness and justice.  (Ibid.)  Jesus appears to have been familiar with this genre, and uses some of its images to point his listeners to that bigger picture of God’s intentions for the world.  \\nBut do we dare hope that God is, as the Bible claims, changing and healing the world?  Is it realistic to say that we are partners with God in this transformation, or are we just flailing along, plagued by our own wishful thinking? \\nThe passage from the apostle Paul in Romans provides some challenging instructions on how to maintain hope in these seeming “in between times.”  “You know what time it is,” Paul enjoins, “how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep, for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near!”  Do we just dismiss Paul’s ramblings because the early church had such a strong expectation of Jesus’ immediate return in physical form?  Again, we remember the multiple layers suggested by the word “salvation.”  Think less, “escape from the firey pits of Hell,” and more about human, political and social transformation here on earth.  On this first Sunday in Advent we encounter readings that seem to suggest: if it looks like all hell is breaking loose, well, the world’s redemption draws near!   \\n\\tThomas Merton, was a Trappist monk and social activist who did so much to open up Christian-Buddhist interfaith dialogue in the early 1960’s before his untimely death.  He wrote of how we might live in such an “inbetween time” when this cosmic transformation is not yet visiable:  “You do not need to know precisely what is happening,” he writes, “or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope.” \\nEugene Peterson’s paraphrase of the Book of Romans, called The Message, puts Paul’s opening words this way:  “Be up and awake to what God is doing!”  Here are some hints on how to embrace “the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment.”  Peterson takes Paul’s curious instruction about “put on the Lord Jesus Christ” and rephrases it with refreshing bluntness:  “get up and get dressed!” Now here is something I can work with, knowing full well how much more hopeful I feel about my day after I have managed to get up and get dressed.  But here’s the catch:  “Dress yourselves in Christ!”  “Christ” – the Greek word for the Hebrew “Messiah.”  Dress yourself in the “Messiah” the one promised one in Jewish tradition who brings about God’s reign of justice, mercy and hope.  “Dress yourselves in Christ?” Don’t just get dressed any old which way, cautions Peterson.  Watch out for those “old garments” that we habitually put on in our lives!  Now there’s  an interesting Advent practice: what are the old clothes of our psyches that just don’t fit anymore, the ways we clothe or present of our persona that just don’t serve us any more?  Cyncisim?  Constant remore? Hopelessness?  Perpetual blaming of others?  Seeming scattered or always in an overwhelmed rush?  Paul has a few dramatic suggestions of what these “old garments” might be, like drunkenness, debauchery and licentiousness, perhaps easily dismissable for most of us.  But then he follows with the more subtle temptations of quarreling and jealously which probably nails most of us.   “Put on the garments of light, not darkness” says Paul.\\nMaybe this is some of how we begin to practice hope in our lives, in a world that is far from redeemed.  We don’t wait to just feel it; we practice it with a way of being in the world.  And the bigger picture of God’s hope-filled intentions slowly begin to take root inside of us.   Even when we “do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going.” (Merton)  We simply affirm that:\\n\\n “Hope is the thing with feathers \\nThat perches in the soul \\nAnd sings the tune without the words \\nAnd never stops at all.”  (Emily Dickinson)\\n\\nAmen.\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tWhat are the disciples thinking at this point?  If they can just stay hidden for awhile maybe things will calm down?  They can slip out of Jerusalem and return to their fishing businesses in the small towns.  But those darn women disciples have not been hiding. They went to the tomb, and they keep saying Jesus is alive!  A disturbing thought; his followers have betrayed and abandoned him.  Then, all of a sudden, in the midst of a hasty evening meal and anxious, conversation, Jesus is standing in the middle of the room!   “Peace be with you,” he announces.  It is hard for us to imagine what this would have been like, all of a sudden seeing your dead teacher and leader standing before you, showing you his wounded hands and side.  Shock, bewilderment, joy….the disciples must have felt a wild mix of emotions.    Perhaps seeing the confusion and fear on their faces, Jesus says to them again: “peace be with you.”  They are expecting condemnation.  They see Jesus; they hear: “peace be with you.”  \\n\\tI hear these words of Jesus, and I am reminded of how we are invited to “pass the peace of Christ” each Sunday at the conclusion of our worship service.   Some churches do it in the middle of the service, some right before Holy Communion is shared.  The words sometimes seem awkward and It’s easy to lapse into a “hi, how are you?’” kind of salutation during this time.  Folks end up chatting about church business or baseball scores or after-worship plans.   I invite us to reconsider these words of Jesus: “peace be with you.”  What is the purpose of saying this?  What are we trying to accomplish in those moments of greeting?  Or,  what might we be extending to one another if we were to look each other directly in the eye and say these words: “peace be with you” - ?   \\n\\tTo extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of Christ, is no casual thing, I believe.  This is not just “being friendly.”  “Peace be with you” one person says; and “and also with you”  the receiver responds.  There is an old-fashion formality to it that may feel strange. I don’t mean to suggest we should greet each other on Sundays with only these four words.  Of course, other words might naturally follow.  But, I am suggesting that the words themselves are a gift we give each other.  I am inviting us to say try on these words and to ask ourselves:  “what am I imagining, what am I hoping for, when I extend the peace of the Risen Lord, the peace of God, to another person?”  \\n\\tThe early Christian communities quickly gained a reputation for some fairly radical lifestyle choices.  We remember that they are living in a middle eastern world of first century Roman occupation.  Military might, carefully engineered roads, magnificent architecture, economic power were all highly valued (Dan Clendenin website).  But we just heard in the Book of Acts that the early followers of the Risen Jesus were known for their being of “one heart and soul,” for a remarkable sense of close community that broke down all kind of social and class barriers.  They were also known for their sharing with one another and with those in need.  “Everything they owned was held in common” and “there was not a needy person among them.”  A remarkable generosity infused their dealings with one another.  This was highly  unusual.  Dan Clendenin, a contemporary Biblical scholar, writes on his web-blog “Journey with Jesus” that these two characteristics of loving community and incredible generosity account for the huge number of converts in Jerusualem.  People wanted to join this “emergent Jesus-community” because it was so different from the rest of their culture.\\n\\t“Peace be with you,” we say to one another.  We don’t really know, on any given Sunday, what a person brings with them to worship.  We don’t really know the full extent of the worries or fears, the sadness or anxiety.  We can barely imagine the difficult memories or painful resentments, or the depth of their material need, or even the stultifying boredom, that lies on the hearts of our fellow worshippers.  Each of us, at one time or another, comes to worship “locked” in something, just like the disciples who were locked behind closed doors.    A newcomer may be in our midst, here for reasons we don’t really know or may not understand.   A longtime member could be sitting next to you filled with all kinds of unpeaceful feelings or thoughts.   I dare say that most of us come to worship on Sunday morning because we are hoping that God’s peace will enter us in a new way when we gather together.  We may come longing for a deeper sense of community; we are hoping that we might know what it is like to be of “one heart and soul” with those who follow Jesus.  Some of us come needing to receive from the material generosity of this community.  Some of us come needing to be on the giving end of that generosity.  “Peace be with you,” we say to stranger and close friend alike.  “Community and generosity is here for you, as it is for me,” we signal one another. \\n\\tWe are not here on Sunday mornings to be entertained; there is plenty of religious entertainment on television and the internet.  Church attendance is no longer a way to gain social status in most communities in this country.  And there are easier and more comfortable ways to visit with your friends than to sit through an hour of worship on a pew! \\n\\tWe come to worship because we want a transformative experience of the living God.  We want in on this radical kind of community where social and class barriers slowly dissolve and we grow together as “one heart and soul.”  We want to be part of a generous congregation which supports the cold-weather homeless shelter, provides disaster relief around the world, helps local people with utility bills and medical costs, gathers school supplies for our needy public schools.  We are here because we long to connect with the God whose peace draws us into community and generosity. \\n\\tWhat a gracious and hopeful thing to say to one another as we conclude our worship time:  “peace be with you.”  Simple words, but they are Jesus’ words.  “Peace be with you” Jesus repeated a second time to the startled disciples.  “As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  And so we are offered God’s peace; and so we are sent.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n(Generosity and community piece from Dan McClendenin)\\n\\nASG email\\t\\nHere at Immanuel, it is our current practice to greet one another by \"passing the peace\" at the end of our Sunday worship service. \\xa0This\\xa0\\nSunday, April 15, our Bible readings invite us to reflect on what we are doing when we extend \"the peace of Christ\" to someone else\\xa0\\n(John 20:19-33 and Acts 4:32-35). \\xa0How is this greeting different from a simple, a \"hi, how are you?\" \\xa0\\n\\nWhen the Resurrected Jesus appeared\\xa0to his disciples after his death, \"peace be with you\" was the first thing he said to them. \\xa0\\nThe disciples were rightfully afraid of Jesus\\' wrath,\\xa0given their mutual betrayal of him. \\xa0Jesus was extending something to the\\xa0\\ndisciples as he said these words. \\xa0It was something they\\xa0do not expect. \\xa0Jesus is extending something to us. \\xa0It is something\\xa0\\nwhich is often difficult for us to accept. \\xa0Join us in worship on Sunday, as we explore this gift together....\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tActually, their tradition was quite clear about what was to happen in the event of their deaths:  it was the firstborn of the two twins, Esau’s, birthright to inherit double what his brother would receive and the elder Esau would also become the leader of the family clan.   But all the early love between their two parents, so sweetly described in last week’s story about the arranged marriage and final meeting of Abraham and Sarah’s heir Jacob, and his wife-to-be,  Rebekah,  seems to have now evaporated.  The story-writer tells us that after waiting almost 20 years to conceive a child, the twins struggled in Rebekah’s womb and understandably drove her nuts.  Then, the twins turn out to be polar opposites: Firstborn Esau is full-on redhead with a lot of body hair, loves hunting and becomes Dad’s favorite.  Jacob is quiet and lives in tents, the women’s world of cooking, sewing, baby-and-elder tending.  Naturally, he becomes Mom’s favorite.  \\n\\tFavoritism: ouch.  Tempting, at times, for many parents and grandparents. Almost always problematic.  A sense of “choseness” can become over-empowerment.  “I get what I want when I want it, because that’s what Mom (or Dad) wants for me!”  Spoiled children grow up into self-focused, self-important, narcissistic adults with little sense of accountability.  And fault lines slowly appear in a loving marriage, where children and turf are constantly defended.  Kids’ loose a sense of the non-favoring parent’s encouragement, loving discipline and blessing.  Parents are now seen as a house divided, people who can be cajoled and played-off one another.  One wonders, in reading such a tale, how God might possibly work through such family dysfunction to bring about God’s purposes of human transformation, societal justice, world peace…..\\n\\tEsau returns from hunting one day, empty-handed, famished and exhausted.  He finds Jacob leaning over a cook-fire, calmly stirring some lentil stew.  “Hey, I’m starving here!  Give me some of that!”  Jacob looks at him slyly; how long has he been planning this move?  Jacob replies:  “Suuuurrrre, my brother.  You’ve had a hard day out there.  Sell me your birthright and the stew is yours!”  Esau quickly responds, “I can’t eat my birthright, can I?  Quick give me some of that before I die!”  Seeing his chance, trickster Jacob intones: “swear to me first.”  “Okay, already.  I swear: my birthright is yours!”  Esau inhales the food.  His birthright is gone.  \\n\\tA few chapters later into the story, we will learn that Dad Issac has grown old and is loosing his eyesight.  Jacob will call his eldest Esau to his side, and admonish him to go out and hunt some game, to bring it home, and prepare him a final meal so that Dad Issac can properly bless Esau before he dies.  In many cultures, such deathbed blessings (or curses) have huge import  and are understood to release a power that could guide the destiny of the one who was blessed.  Rebekah will overhear this conversation, and quickly arrange for Jacob to sneak into Dad’s tent in Esau’s absence.  She will lie to her husband, and help Jacob disquise himself as hairy, game-smelly Esau, and father Issac will be totally confused.  Jacob will tell a serious of bald-faced lies, Issac will end up giving his deathbed blessing to the younger twin.   Talk about family dysfuncion! Clearly, Biblical characters are included in scripture not because they merit God’s loving attention always make right choices or behave well. Repeatedly, they fail God and they fail one another.  What is God doing with these humans? Apparently, God is willing to work with families who are chosen, blessed and a mess.  Somehow I find this rather encouraging.  In what way might I be a mess, but still be chosen and blessed so I may be part of God’s purposes?  \\n\\t    Might there be a few more hints for us about our part in God’s purposes in our other reading? At first glance, this parable about sower, seed and soil may sound like weird and wasteful agricultural practices.  A sower basically who tosses huge amounts of seed willy-nilly all over the place.  Hardly prudent farming, where you let good seed go to the birds, fall on thin rocky soil, and on ground filled with thorny weeds.  And after all this wastefulness, what is this about a harvest from the few seeds that made it to more hospitable soil?  For farming of Jesus’ time and desert-like location, a return of 4-10 fold was considered normal and 15 times what was sown was fantastic.   This harvest brought up to 100 times what was planted?  How could this be? “Let anyone who hears, listen!” Jesus concludes.  Hmmmm….where is he going with this?\\tWhat is this telling us about the ways of God with humans?\\nBy the time Jesus speaks this parable about the sower and the seed, he is running into considerable opposition; people in his home town, religious authorities, local occupying forces.  There was something unsettling, too radically inclusive in his message.  The religious leaders, understandably, were trying their darndest to maintain the traditions, culture and survival of their small nation under a repressive Roman power. Under pressure, most groups “circle the wagons” so to speak.  Questions of who is chosen, who is “in” and who is “out” become more important as the leaders draw the line on who the community can take care of in the uncertain times.  The poor, the sinners (breakers of the Law), the sick, the tax collectors who dealt with those impure Romans, were all seen as unclean and dispensable.  Jesus was, in the leaders mind, carelessness strewing the “seed” of God’s word and God’s redemptive grace, to those marginalized, dispensable people.  Somehow, the “grounds” of these less-than people’s souls were receptive to these “seeds.”  God’s word of invitation, compassion and hope, as they saw and heard it in Jesus, found fertile ground within them.  Many of the religious and community leaders thought Jesus doing more than wasting his time; he made God look much too generous.\\nSermons on this text traditionally focus on the soil:  what kind of soil are each of us?  Is my life filled with distractions, like hungry birds who dive-bomb and gobble up God’s invitations and intentions for me?  Am I like thin, rocky soil: initial enthusiasum for serving God, but then I lose interest?  Is the soil of my life filled with the thorns of temptation, the lure of the fast, high life?   But, think about it, can soil actually change itself?  No it cannot.  I think Jesus was focusing on the sower, and this is where we might get a bit nervous.  Because if God is anything like this sower, God is perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic, one might even say, careless, with spreading around the seed of God’s grace.  If this story is about the sower, a God who is extravagantly generous with the gift of potential fruitfulness, then I’m in trouble.  Because I tell you, there is a part of me that wants God to reward the hard-working virtuous people and to at least ignore the lazy, the tricksters and evil-prone people (like Jacob in the Genesis story).   “People shouldn’t get something for nothing, especially not for cheating” goes the dity in my head.   These are tough times, for our country and our local community. A lot of folks are holding down several jobs to make ends meet, and the ends are barely being met.  And all these people flooding our borders!  We too, may be tempted to “circle the wagons.”\\nBut the sower in this story is strewing seeds all over the place.  “A sower went out to sow,” said Jesus.   “So, what hangs up your generosity,” Jesus seems to imply.  What hangs up our generosity of spirit with others who are a mess?  Or our generosity with the messy, dysfunctional parts of ourselves? God is bound and determined to continue choosing and blessing all kinds of us because God needs us to work out God’s purposes in the world.  God’s extravagant generosity is unsettling.  God choses and works through lying, cheating Jacob to create a people who will be repeatedly called to serve as a light to the nations.   As adults, after much hardship and sadness, Jacob and Esau will finally reconcil, mostly due to the wronged Esau’s extravagant generosity and forgiveness.  “A sower went out to sow,” and seeds went every which way.  “Let anyone with ears, listen!  said Jesus.  Abundantly, extravagantly, God’s grace is being strewn all over the place.   God is choosing us at our best and our worst.  Asking us to be partners in God’s purposes right here, right now.   Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAs I gazed at this greeting card, I thought about how scarey and unpredictable the world, and our nation, feels right now.  I thought about how people act when they don’t feel that their neighborhood, their school, their church, their country is a safe and secure place.  Reflecting on news reports of increased bullying and violence towards people of color and immigrants across our nation, it seems like a lot of people are not feeling that their’s is a “safe and secure time and place.”  In the midst of all this, I can feel this longing for home, places of certainty and safety inside of me, where my adult children and their beloveds join us for celebratory meals, and even relocate to the Twin Cities….especially in light of all that has happened in these last weeks. \\nBut while my insurance company is bringing me homey Thanksgiving greetings, the church calendar does something not quite as comforting.  As our cycle of scripture readings conclude at the end of each November, every year at this time we are pulled back to the tense days of Jesus’ arrest and execution.  Certainly a jarring departure from visions of predictable safety and security, of families and friends gathering for feasting and fellowship!  \\nOur cycle of weekly Bible readings come from the Revised Common Lectionary that we share with Christian churches around the world.  And they often provide an unsettling counterpoint to the current mood around us:  At first glace, there is this cognitive dissonance.  We’re just about ready for Advent and Christmas, and now we are reading about Jesus being mocked as he hangs on the cross?  The timing seems weird.  Many us are struggling to pull it together and move forward with some hopefulness after unsettling days for our nation.  A group of us came down to church yesterday, to be tutored by one of our members in the mysteries of pie crust.  Girls and women from elementary school age to grandmother age.  How soothing to roll pie dough in the company of followers of Jesus who love pie!  Please, can we just bake pies and plan the lovely cycle through the Advent season of choral offerings and pageants and caroling, Christmas décor?  We’re doing our best to sing upbeat Thanksgiving hymns, planning menus and in-gatherings of loved ones.  We’re getting ready to move on to baby Jesus stories!  But the last week of the annual church calendar, right before Advent, always hauls us back to the foreboding texts of Jesus crucifixion, accompanied with strong words of the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah, railing against the corrupt leaders of his 6th century BCE Jewish world.  Again, as we approach scripture, we experience that disorienting disjunction between what seems apparent on the surface, and what else might be going on.  And this encounter between surface appearance and what God has going on is usually met with understandable resistance on our part.  \\nThe texts for today challenge us to consider what we really do believe about safety and security in the world, the Kingdom/Realm of God and the ultimate role of Jesus Christ in our lives today. The texts bring us this:  what kind of King are you Jesus?  What kind of ruler of the universe, of our world, are you God?  \\n\\tIt was Pope Pius in 1925 who initially put out the call to identify the last Sunday in the liturgical year as  “Christ the King Sunday.”  As Protestants, we could certainly ignore this.  But Pope Pius made an oddly prescient decision with this declaration, during a period of both hopefulness and real bleakness in the 1920’s.   It was a time when nations watched the rise of new repressive dictators emerging in Europe over the shambles of World War I that was to end all wars.  Perhaps not a bad idea to invite the church universal to consider some of the wider questions of “who is in charge,” in this chaotic world.  We don’t fancy talking about kings much here in America; we had a revolution in part so we wouldn’t have to endure a monarchy in which we were not represented.   And all that triumphalism in phrases like “Christ the King” that makes Christianity sound like the only viable or true religion on earth.  So, why pay attention to this day, at the end of the church liturgical year? \\n\\tBecause it’s not enough to retreat into safety and security right now.  Today’s texts ask us to take a hard look at the very powers that rule among us that are “destroying and scattering,” in Jeremiah’s words.  “Driving away” and hurting the very community that they are charged to support and protect.  The prophet voices God’s concern and dismay as the people of Israel struggle after returning from exile in Babylon 6th century BCE:  a series of Jewish kings have become corrupt, having sold out to the interests of the wealthy and powerful, they no longer maintain the well-being of the people.  (one Biblical commentator noted about this passage) As Richard Nysse, professor of Old Testament, comments on this passage:  “Hurt caused by poor (human) leadership is a problem for God.”  The text “doesn’t assert specific leadership principles”  - it simply “announces the attention of God and the events that ensue from that attention.”  Or, I would put it a bit more bluntly:  it’s as though God finally says, “damn-it, all of you, Enough!  I’ll do it!  I’m going to gather the remnant, bring them back into the fold, help them be fruitful and multiply, and raise up one in the future who will reign wisely and will rule with justice and righteousness.”  \\n\\tIs it any wonder that, after meeting Jesus and choosing to follow the Jesus Way, first century Christians looked back at this ancient text and said to themselves:  Here we are under oppressive Roman imperialist rule.  Yes, Jesus is the one that God was talking about in this prophetic passage, the righteous one to come.  Early Christians would look back to the crucifixion of Jesus and remember the taunting sign above his head, “King of the Jews.”  Jesus was mocked with the title “Messiah,” which was later translated into the Greek word “Christos,” or Christ.  Filled with a sense that Christ’s spirit continued to live in them and guide them, Christians would compare Jesus’ “kingship” or authority to Roman imperial rule of their day.  And it produced a very counter-intuitive image:  their’s was a crucified king. As the UCC theologian and minister Tony Robinson comments on this passage, whoever Jesus is for us, the New Testament claims that “This King is one who doesn’t rule, but stands with; doesn’t assert but surrenders; is not in the self-interest business.” “Note well,” concludes Robinson, “safety and security are not the result of more security measures or security police or security technology. They are the result of a healthy community characterized by justice and righteousness.”  \\n\\tMy thanksgiving card speaks of “coming home,” ironically celebrating a day when my ancestors took away the home of the local population, killing or dislocating them.  I think about how we celebrate God’s good gifts of abundance in our lives at Thanksgiving, while still priding ourselves in our self-sufficiency.  “Ah, all is right with my self-sufficient world. We take care of our own.  God’s gracious hand is truly upon us.” But if we are paying attention, we are faced with a wider world of great disparity, scarcity of food, shelter, potable water and secure livelihoods, amidst the abundance.  \\t\\n\\tI’ve shared with you before about the huge map of the world that hangs in my husband’s and my dining room.   One of my prayer practices is to bodily lean against the map.  I think about the mystery of God’s reign of justice and righteousness, hope and mercy and how I might be a larger part of that tending and healing.  I wonder about how our home of ultimate safety and security is in God.  Not protection, certainly, but accompaniment.  Staring at the map, I look for a few hot spots on the planet:  places where enmity and fear and hatred continue to boil..  I place my two hands on two different places and lean my head into the map.  I let my prayerful attending imagine God’s restorative attention. \\n\\tThese scripture texts stretch my imagination, just as we want to focus inward on hearth and physical home.  They remind us that the forces of destruction and scattering are not the last word.  The texts call us to action by first calling us to notice and attend to those not feeling safe and secure, accompanying those who struggle in these days.  We give thanks for these provocative texts, and for this time to worship and reflect together.  We give thanks for God’s attention and accompanying of us, even now.   Amen.  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe problem with being told to do something is that we often bristle, feel resistant, perhaps even a bit defensive.  Anyone having ever lived with a toddler knows that this starts at about age 2.  At that age, we are beginning to develop a sense of our self as separate from our parents, and this involves some inevitable challenging of authority.  “No!” the 2 year old delights is saying, with ferocious enthusiasm!  As we become older and start to separate from our parents, we grow as a separate individual who is still connected to a family unit.  And we often define ourselves by who our family is not.  In 8th grade I declared I was an atheist, in part because my parents were not.  As a senior in high school I became strongly evangelical in my Christian faith, in part because my parents were most assuredly not evangelical Christians.  Both of these religious stands had to do in part with my striving to do (what psychologists have come to call) the necessary “separation and individuation” to become an autonomous adult.      \\nAs adolescents and young adults, many of us talk of wanting to be “free” but we are not yet sure just what this might mean.   “Free” for what?  As an adult, I have come to realize that simply being oppositional to authority, without figuring out for myself what I value and believe, was a dead end. I might be against this or that, but what was I ultimately for?   \\n\\tIn the United Church of Christ, we come from what is called a “free church tradition.”  This means that the denominations that came before us, the Evangelical and Reformed, the Congregational and Christian churches, all affirmed three things when it came to congregational governance:  each congregation should have the freedom to call and hire its own pastor, the freedom to order or design its own worship liturgy, and the freedom to own (and pay for) its own building.  That’s a lot of freedom!  But what are we free for?\\n\\tToday’s scripture passage from Matthew gives us some guidance on this.  We have to be careful not to pull Jesus’ words out of their historical and cultural context.  This is often done with this teaching about divorce which we’ll consider in a moment. But what Jesus tells us about human behavior and intention is revealing.  Paradoxically, these ways of living may lead to what can make us the most free: choosing life over death.\\n\\tJesus is being quite clear with his disciples that he has not come to discount or overthrow their Jewish life and Law.  He has come to deepen their connection to the Law, the Torah’s commandments which are life-giving.  His audience would have been steeped in the Law’s teachings and would have immediately recognized today’s Deuteronomy passage from their Hebrew scriptures.  The speaker is Moses, who has led the Jewish people out of slavery in Egypt, through years of wandering in the wilderness, and now stands with them on the edge of the promised land with them. This is his goodbye speech before he dies: “I have set before you life and death.  Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, loving the Lord your God, hearing God’s voice and holding fast to God.”  In the Matthew passage hundreds of years later, Jesus says: “You have heard it said to those of ancient times,” referring to the Law and the Torah.  He might as well have said, “Hang on to your hats, because I am challenging you to take God’s law even deeper!”  \\nJesus had an uncanny way of understanding the perceptions, attitudes and emotions that often come before an act that is contrary to God’s Law.  The behaviors of murder, adultery, divorce or swearing falsely all are preceded by a significant shift in how we are thinking and feeling.  And that shift is what Jesus was concerned about, because they can move us towards choosing death, not life.\\n\\tDr. Amy Oden, professor of Church History at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, has written that Jesus’ challenging people to a ”righteousness in this new Kingdom of God that was more than following rules.”  (WorkingPreacher.org commentary, Epiphany 6A).   In Jesus’ time, simply following the rules meant that in both the patriarchal Jewish and Roman society any married woman could be divorced and discarded quite easily.  Today, laws in this country protect women from automatically loosing their property, children and livelihood when a marriages ends.  First century women lost everything; they were left destitude.  This isn’t right, said Jesus.  Participation in the Kingdom of God entails a different kind of righteousness.  Its about a mutual love and support that brings mercy, justice and compassion to human intention and behavior.  \\n\\tIn considering Jesus’ command about murder, Professor Oden suggests that when we are in disagreement with someone else in our church community, few of us actually consider murdering that person.  But how many times have we been angry over some perceived slight or some unresolved misunderstanding in the church?  In congregation after congregation, I have notice that many find it difficult to approach a person directly about a problem.  In an effort to be polite or keep the peace, we either keep it inside or we go “sideways” and tell someone else about how bothered we are, venting, hoping that word will be “passed along”  It amazes me that Jesus never stayed long in a particular faith community, but he was spot-on about one of the most common problems in congregations:  unresolved conflict which simmers and seeps and moves side-ways.  A new church program is launched, a change is made in worship and inevitable disagreements arise.  Not everyone is pleased, which is natural.  A church with no conflict is actually a dying church.  Thriving churches learn how to handle conflict with honesty and love.   But usually, instead of the disagreement being shared directly, instead of people offering their views directly with staff or lay leaders involved and everyone benefiting from listening compassionately and learning more about our different beliefs and perspectives…. the complaint is never expressed.  Or,  So and so is bothered about such and such, tells a third party and conflict goes unresolved. \\n\\t“First be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come offer your gift” at the altar, says Jesus.  Maybe Passing of the Peace should happen right before the offering!  Part of a successful interim period between pastors often involves some shifting in how a congregation handles disagreements.  Your Church Council has been working hard over this last year on clarifing for how we conduct church business together, and how to openly and creatively handle the disagreements when inevitable conflict arises.  \\n\\tOne thing I find so compelling about Jesus is his ability to see inside me, and to help me see inside me.  His teachings help me be accountable not just for my actions, but also for my perceptions and feelings.  How might these be transformed, I have to ask myself.  God’s indwelling Spirit helps me honestly face the stuff on the inside, my internal orientation.  “This is where the choosing life or death really lies,” implies Jesus.   It’s way before the murderous action; it is in the resentment and grudges we harbor.  It is way before the adulterous affair; it is in the way we pay more attention to work, sports or the Internet instead of our life partner (Amy Oden, IBID).   The choice is way before the actual divorce; it is in the slow breakdown of communication and mutual respect.  It’s way before the swearing falsely, it is in our equivocating.  It is when we refuse to let our “yes” be “yes” and our “no” be “no.”  \\nI am challenged by these teachings to my bones.   For me, they are freedom-filled and life-giving.  They help me choose life.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n I have heard it said that each time we come to worship, we come as a different person.  We come with a slightly changed self-awareness and a somewhat shifted view of the world.  This week, I find I come to worship with a deepened sense of gratefulness for this congregation, and the care and prayers many of you have extended to my family with my husband’s recent surgery and my foot injury.  I come with a stronger belief in free speech and of journalistic freedom, following the murders of French political journalists.  “What does my Christian faith have to say about such darkness,” I find myself asking? But I also bring my struggles about the limits of freed speech, about the appropriateness of hate speech in our multi-cultural world.  How would Jesus talk about those with whom he disagreed?  This is why we need to gather in worship repeatedly, often.  We will have with a new and different need for forgiveness, a surprising occurrence that we need to give thanks for, a closed part of our mind that needs gentle challenging and nudging open.  Again and again, we come to worship needing to experience and know God’s power to re-orient us, heal us, change us, bless us. \\n\\nI wonder if Jesus headed to the River Jordan that day because he sensed something was different in him.  Some new self-awareness bubbling up inside of him after years of working along side his father as a carpenter?  Some fresh realization of the injustices of the misuse of power and wealth?  Perhaps a welling up of compassion for those under the crushing oppression of the Roman occupation and religious practices gone stale? John the Baptist invited fellow Jews of his day to step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized as a sign of God’s forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly pushed Jesus to join the crowd by the Jordan River.  He suddenly emerges from an obscure youth and young adulthood, and aligning himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  \\nLater church doctrine will insist that Jesus was without sin.  But did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own regrets and hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually “dry” himself?   Did he feel a desire to turn his life around, to quench some deeper thirst in those river waters? Jesus was apparently well read in Hebrew scripture; did this watery baptism experience weave with his recollection of the primal waters described in Genesis….God creating something new out of a void, a formless matter and a watery abyss?  Did he sense the Spirit brooding over him, calling forth a new part of him, or a new way of being? “You are my Son, my Beloved; with you I am well pleased?” the words came to him. How would the memory of this event resonate for him in the months and years to come?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  In his baptism, Jesus experienced himself as being worthy, loved and intimately connected to God, as he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”   \\nIt seems only natural that Jesus would spent much of his ministry reminding other people that God found them worthy and beloved.  Yet for all our talk about encouraging high self-esteem and feeling good about ourselves, many of us who seek to follow Jesus have a tough time with this concept.  We seem to fall on one side of the fence of the other:  We either under-estimate our value and worth as a human being, or we over-estimate it.  We might constantly cut ourselves down and feel less-than everyone else.  Or we may move in a grandiose bubble where we are better than others, with little insight into our own fallibility, our limits, of where and how we might need to change.  Oblivious to the fact that we might be dependent on others or on God.  \\nStories down through the ages are filled with characters that see themselves as unworthy, unredeemable and unlovable, contrasted with those who strut their supposedly power and perfection. The fictional character Jean Val Jean has become familiar to many of us through movies and stage productions, even if we haven’t actually waded through Victor Hugo’s 19th century French novel Les Miserables.  Here is someone who felt unredeemable to his core.  I have always found the scene where Jean Val Jean is released from prison to be particularly riveting.  This lowly commoner had spent 19 years in the pre-Revolutionary French “galleys” as the prison colonies were called.  He was ordered to serve 5 years for having broken a pane of storefront glass and stealing a loaf of bread.  Added to this term were 14 more for 4 escape attempts.  He was a tree-pruner who fell on hard times; but by the time he is released from prison, Val Jean (John) has lost his connections with his previous life, and even his name.  Now convict #24,601, he has self-protectively retreated within himself.  “From year to year,” wrote Victor Hugo, “this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal sureness.  When the heart is dry, the eye is dry,” the author continued.  “On his departure from the galleys it had been 19 years since he had shed a tear.”  “When the heart is dry, the eye is dry….”\\n\\tVal Jean’s dry heart is exposed early in the story, through yet another act of thievery just after he gets out of prison.  The act appears congruent with the person he has become; someone possessed by a “dry heart.” Perhaps this sounds familiar: To be stuck with a heart that feels so dry, parched, and rigid that we can’t seem to change our self-perceptions or our actions.  \\n\\tIn Victor Hugo’s story, Jean Val Jean is newly released from prison, wandering in a daze, and finally stumbles upon the home of a kindly Bishop and his sister.  They generously offer him a meal and a place to sleep for the night, but Val Jean decides to steal from them. Taking some silver candlesticks, he escapes over the garden wall.  The next morning he is caught, and dragged back to the Bishop’s home by the police.  When confronted with the thief, the Bishop slyly inquires of his sister: \"was that silver ours?\"  His sister is stupefied by his question.  The Bishop continues: “I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently.\"  Speaking now to the policemen, the Bishop asks innocently: \"And he told you, that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? It is a mistake.\"\\n\\tThe police let him go. Jean Val jean is confused, and wary… \"My friend,\" resumes the Bishop, \"before you go, here are your candlesticks. Take them.”  Jean Val jean is totally bewildered.  \"Now,\" says the Bishop, \"go in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night.\" The Bishop draws near to him, and says in a low voice: \"And do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man.\" Jean Val jean, who has no recollection of ever having promised anything, remains speechless. The Bishop continues in a grave whisper:  \"Jean Val Jean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.\"\\n“You no longer belong to evil, but to good.”  It takes many years for this reality to sink-in for Hugo’s character.  How do we allow this message to really sink into us, as individuals and as a congregation?  Another way to approach this question of self-understanding is to ask:  To what or to whom do we each belong, ultimately?  In early times, after a new follower of the Jesus Way was baptized, he or she would say, “I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.”  This was a seditious statement at the time, and could get your arrested by the Roman authorities.  It meant that your primary allegiance was not to Caesar, not even to your family or tribe.  Followers knew themselves to be raised from their mistakes and false assumptions, their limited worldviews and clannishness, their passive acceptance of injustice.  In the sacrament of baptism, they were raised into a belovedness as God’s sons and daughters. \\n\\n\\tAs your hands immerse in water this week, I invite you to remember your own baptism.  Remember your baptism, even if you were an infant at that time, and that you are claimed as beloved by God.  Try on these words this week:  “I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ” as you go through your daily round, as many other forces seek to claim your allegiance.  If you have never been baptized, perhaps consider this sacrament as an invitation to proclaim just whom you truly belong to.  Let’s talk together how this might be a public sign of where your allegiance truly lies at this point in your life.  Ultimately, do we belong to the world….or to God?  \\n\\tThe Good News is that we are accountable for but we don’t belong to the mistakes of our past.  We do not belong to our failures nor do we belong to the wounds received from others. We belong to good because we belong to God. Besides all of us, who else in the community needs to hear this message?   Absorbing this reality ourselves, and sharing it with others; this is the work of the church. We are God’s beloved sons and daughters, initially created this way as humans and reborn into Christ through baptism.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. ',\n",
       " '\\n“Once to every man and nation.”  And once to every woman and nation, I would add.  In spite of its gender exclusive title, this hymn by James Russell Lowell never fails to stir and challenge me.  This 19th century poet, editor and diplomat was the son of a Congregational minister.  Lowell was also an active abolitionist, working with his wife Maria White in the New England anti-slavery movement.  Our hymn is part of a longer poem called “The Present Crisis,” which Lowell published the poem in Boston in 1845, as a protest against US involvement in the war with Mexico. Lowell was convinced that land added to Texas would only increase the territory of permitted slavery. After a portion of the poem was set to music, it was often sung in many New England Congregational churches which felt called to anti-slavery work. “Once to every man, woman and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side.”  These denominational ancestors of our United Church of Christ believed that the prevailing supposed “truth” of black people’s inherent inferiority to white people was a “falsehood.”  For them, “time (had truly) made ancient good uncouth.”  \\nSING THE SECOND VERSE TOGETHER…..\\nThe tone of the hymn is somber, even gruesome at times: we walk a path “by light of burning martyrs,” tracking “Jesus’ bleeding feet.”  Yet, I experience an odd mixture of feeling both chastened and hopeful as I sing the words, convicted again and again by the phrase, “new occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.” \\nAs a congregation, we are at an interesting confluence of “new occasions.”  Part of our visioning process is figuring out just what are these “new occasions” that surround us in the community.  What is it about this growing disparity between the rich and the poor in our part of Fairfax County?  How can so many working people be struggling to feed their families?  In this continually transient area, how do busy two career families find a sense of community and belonging?  How do all the young single professionals pouring into the Tysons area find an intergenerational tribe that will welcome and help feed their spiritual hunger, especially when they are so understandably leary of organized religion?  In response to these “new occasions” what “new duties” are being revealed to us as disciples of Jesus?  \\nTomorrow, we again have the opportunity to reflect on the prophetic life and ministry of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  As we pause and listen, we may well be challenged to focus again on the realities of poverty, racism and war that Dr. King so boldy preached about in the 1960’s, and that continue to plague our life together.  I learned recently that even though it has been nearly 60 years since the “U.S. Supreme Court overturned a ‘separate but equal’ doctrine that reinformced segregation, almost a quarter of Americans say it is OK for races to be separate as long as they have equal opportunities.”  This and other findings of the recently released Rice University “2012 Portraits of American Life Study” indicate a “growing gap in racial attitudes and experiences in America.”  An article in this week’s Christian Century Magazine (January 22, 2014, p. 15-16), describes how this major six year study explored the impact of religion on everyday life in the US, asking the same questions about ethnic and religious diversity to the same diverse group of people in 2006 and 2012.  What has changed? the researchers asked.  Apparently, we are “a land of two Americas divided by race and less willing than ever to find a common ground of understanding.”  The study reveals that  “perceived racial injustice rose for both whites and blacks in between 2006 and 2012.  The percentage of whites who said they had been treated unfairly because of their race in the last 3 years rose from 8 percent in 06 to 14 percent in ’12.  The percentage of blacks reporting prejudice rose from 36 percent to 46 percent in that same time period.”  45 percent of white respondents in 2006 said “one of the most effective ways to improve race relations was to stop talking about race.  In 2012, that figure rose to 59 percent who wanted to stop talking about race.”    What is the “new occasion” we find ourselves in as celebrate Dr. King’s birthday this year?  It seems that more and more people just want to stop talking about race.   \\n\\tKarl Barth, the 20th century German Protestant theologian, used to say that preachers must write their sermons holding the daily newspaper in one hand and the Bible in the other.  We may receive our news through a different medium today: radio, TV, internet, tweets.  But however we learn about the emerging “new occasions” around us, Barth’s words still hold.  This dialogue between the realities of the present world and the ancient wisdom of our holy text is a good practice for any follower of Jesus.  This dialogue helps us get more clear about Jesus’ invitation to follow him.  So, today I lift up this Portraits of American Life Study in one hand, and in the other - our Epiphany texts from scripture which bring us a epiphany snapshot, a perspective on the revealing of Jesus’ identity.  Let’s turn to this text from the Gospel of John. \\n\\tWhile he does not describe Jesus’ baptism directly, the gospel writer John reports that John the Baptiszer publicly acknowledges Jesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!”   Some Christians interpret this as meaning that Jesus, in his death, will become the divine sacrifice for human sin.  As I studied this text this week, I discovered that in Jesus time, lambs were not regularly used in Jewish Temple sacrifices for individual sins.   Lambs were used solely during the Passover celebration, when the Jewish people would remember the liberation and deliverance of their people from slavery in Egypt.  Is the gospel writer John wanting us to know that Jesus is to be the one to show people how not to be slaves?  Not just slave to their own sins but as slaves to their oppressors and to their living as outcasts in their communities.  In his relationships with people, Jesus will show all kinds of troubled, hurting and marginalized folks how to experience the freedom of forgiveness, to transform both their behavior and lives of those around them.  He will also push communities to welcome these people back from the margins, into full fellowship among them.  Two of the Baptizer’s disciples hear John the Baptist exclaim, “look here is the Lamb of God” and the two men are intrigued; they start to walk after Jesus.  Jesus senses them there, turns and asks:  “What are you looking for?”  Jesus certainly gets right to the point.  “What do you really want? Jesus might ask of each of us: “What are you looking for?”   Such a pointed question.  It’s almost scarey to ask it of ourselves.  What are we looking for? An end to all this discussion about race so we can then truly live in the post-racial society that we dream about?   I don’t think that is how we get there.   After the verdict in the Trayvon Martin murder case, I suggested that we might read together The New Jim Crow:  Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, by Michelle Alexander.  My offer still stands.  Stopping the discussion doesn’t make something change.  \\n\\t“What are you looking for?” Jesus asks the two men who approach him.  It’s a question about change, isn’t it?  What do you want to change?  The men make a curious reply: “Rabbi, teacher, where are you staying?”  They actually ask him “where are you abiding, remaining” – it’s almost like they asked for his address!  “Give us something, someplace, that we can identify you by!” or “who the heck ARE you?!”   And Jesus replies, “come and see.”  Not “come and take a look” ,but come and “see” as in “experience,” or “recognize.”   \\nWhat is Jesus inviting them to?  To experience, recognize, that the Kingdom of God is at hand.  God’s reign, where the first shall be last and the last shall be first, is at hand.  Where the poor will be fed and the captives released and the blind will see and the lame walk.  Where people can be changed, transformed into disciples who share God’s love for the world. \\n\\t “New occasion bring new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth. Standeth God within the shadow keeping watch above his own.”  This God of ours not only keeps watch, but continually tries to get our attention.  This God is calling each of us to new duties, as we become transformed by the presence of the Spirit of the Risen Jesus in our lives.  What new visions and new calls will emerge for each of us in these coming months?  For this congregation?  Let’s be in conversation together.  “Come and see,” says Jesus.  Amen. \\n\\nI invite you to remain seated and to join with me in singing this final verse together, followed by some time of silent reflection.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe Gospel of John tells us that Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb first.  It’s quite remarkable this detail was retained in scripture, given how patriarchal and repressive of women the Christian church will later become.  Other men and women followers of Jesus were reported to have gone to Jesus’ grave that early morning.  But for some reason, Mary Magdalene is the only person mentioned in each of the four different Gospel versions of this empty tomb story.  Why this one piece of consistency in four divergent accounts?  Why was she so important to be repeatedly named?  Remember Dan Brown’s popular mystery-detective story, The Da Vinci Code?  Was it true, as Brown suggests, that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and had a child together?   This idea is offensive, even scandalous to some people, and it’s a rather titillating idea to others.  I wonder if the answer for her prominence doesn’t lie somewhere even more challenging.  Could it be, as an increasing number of Biblical scholars are suggesting, that Mary Magdalene was the follower, the disciple of Jesus, who actually got what he was teaching?  Was she the one who didn’t abandon hm, when the other disciples did, because she fully understood Jesus’ call to human transformation through self-emptying and sacrificial love?    \\n\\tWe follow this grieving and unnerved woman as she stumbles through the early darkness, looking for the body of her beloved Teacher and friend.   The Gospel of John has already described in previous verses that her visit is not about bringing spices and completing the burial preparations.  Nichodemus, the Jewish religious leader sympathetic to Jesus’ cause, had already supplied pounds of myrrh and aloes the night Jesus was buried.  The other followers are apparently in hiding, because surely the Roman soldiers are looking for them too.  So what is Mary Magdalene up to in the dark?  As she approaches, she is stunned to see the closure to the tomb rolled away.  Grave robbers? Proceeding no further, she runs to get several of the other men disciples.  Two of them come back with her, and peer into the cave-like enclosure.  They spot the pile of burial clothes.  Mary is still worried someone has stolen Jesus’ body.  But these bundled pieces of cloth would probably still be on Jesus’ body if someone had moved him to another location.  The men disciples recognize that the body is truly gone, but can’t make heads or tails of this.  They return to their homes.\\tBut Mary stays rooted to the spot, weeping.  She had hope for the cold comfort of seeing and touching Jesus’ dead body; but this has been taken from her.  Through her tears, she peers into the tomb again and sees two angelic beings standing where Jesus’ body should have been.  They seem to know something and begin to question her.  She suddenly senses another presence behind her.  Turning, she sees someone standing there, who repeats the angels’ question: “why are you crying?”  Not recognizing who this man is, she pleads, “Sir, tell me where his body is.” Then suddenly this someone calls her by name: Mary.  In that moment, she recognizes Jesus.  And the unrecognizable all of a sudden becomes incomprehensible: “Teacher, it’s you!”  In astonishment and joy, she naturally reaches for him.  But Jesus sees how her love for him is grasping, still yearning for a tangible corpse.  What she is now confronted with is an intangible aliveness beyond her wildest dreams (Cynthia Bourgeault, p. 130, Wisdom Jesus).  “Don’t hold on to me, don’t cling to me,” he tells her.\\n\\tThe Gospel writers want us to know that Jesus, despite all evidence of his dying, is now alive.  What? This challenging of the power of death itself is the most paradoxical part of the Easter claim for me.   Something dead is now alive.  Not a resuscitated body; this man who embodied God’s radically inclusive, unstoppable love was really dead…but has now been transformed into a living entity that is among us.  All this is less about belief and more about encounter.  And for several millennium, Christians have been saying much the same thing: we testify to this ongoing presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst, and how that presence is making new life, transformation, possible in us. \\n\\tThere is something almost ridiculous about this claim, in part because our best thinking can’t quite comprehend it.  How can it be that dead hopes and dreams, feeling dead inside, declining bodies, is not the final part of each of our stories? It is almost the stuff of dreams, not unlike the one the Spanish poet, Antonio Machado records in his poem “Last Night As I Lay Sleeping.”  The idea of new life busting out of deadness is so fantastical and error-like, it has to come to him under the cover of sleep, when his conscious, linear-thinking brain is no longer in charge.  Hear his words or follow on the front of the worship bulletin:\\t\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a spring was breaking\\nout in my heart.\\nI said: Along which secret aqueduct,\\nOh water, are you coming to me,\\nwater of a new life\\nthat I have never drunk?\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat I had a beehive\\nhere inside my heart.\\nAnd the golden bees\\nwere making white combs\\nand sweet honey\\nfrom my old failures.\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a fiery sun was giving\\nlight inside my heart.\\nIt was fiery because I felt\\nwarmth as from a hearth,\\nand sun because it gave light\\nand brought tears to my eyes.\\n\\nLast night as I slept,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat it was God I had\\nhere inside my heart.\\xa0 \\t\\n\\tMy mistakes, my failures, my deadness being transformed?  This can’t be right.  “Marvelous error,” Machado testifies, over and over.   How can it be that these changes come to me, he wonders.  I dreamt I had a fiery sun giving light inside my heart.  That’s crazy!  “Last night, as I slept I dreamt, marvelous error, that it was God I had here in my heart.”  The spirit of the living God, inside of our hearts.  “Fear not,” said Jesus at his last meal with his followers, “I will be with you always.”\\n\\tSometimes we get so caught up in the calculated logic of the world and what our conscious ego analyzes might be possible.  “I just can’t let go of that resentment, that disappointment, that mistake.”  We miss the possibility of our own inner healing of memories and our own changing of attitudes and habits. \\n\\tI wonder if in that moment of hearing Jesus call her name, Mary Magdalene finally recognizes her transformed self.   She is not just a woman frantically bereaved, torn from the person who embodied Gods’ radically inclusive love.  She is Mary, beloved disciple and forgiven one, a woman who has come to see her own old failures transformed.  One who came to know and accept her own precious self through her relationship with this Teacher and friend.  The crucified Jesus is now present in a new and different way; and his followers are to share his message and minister in his name.  Mary Magdalene gets it.  She will bring the good news of resurrection back to the disciples; her testimony will be the spark.  She will be called by the early, pre-patriarchal church, “the Apostle to the Apostles.” \\n\\tOn this morning, we encounter Jesus again, as he stood before Mary Magdalene on that garden path.  He  addresses us each of us by name, recalling us to our own precious selves.  May our testimonies spark new life and hope.\\n\\tFor Christ has risen.  Christ is risen indeed.  Alleluia and Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tA lot of people grow up with the Bible as a book of do’s and don’t’s; like\\na rule book.  “Do this, don’t do that.”  “You must always….you must never.” \\nThis is unfortunate.  With this limited perspective of scripture, we can loose\\nourselves in debates about individualistic morality.  We can miss the wider perspective of perennial wisdom offered in these ancient texts.  Not unlike other religious traditions around the world, I believe the Bible has the potential to open us to “a Divine Reality underneath and inherent in the world of things.”  As Richard Rohr, contemporary Franciscan and spiritual teacher describes this common thread in all perennial wisdom traditions, there is the understanding that \\n\\t\\tThere is in “the human soul (has) a natural capacity, similarity, and longing for this Divine Reality, and\\n\\t\\tThe final goal of existence is union with this Divine Reality.\\u2028”  (Rohr’s Center website)  \\nBut if the Jewish and Christian scriptures are just a rule book, one may be left wondering if God isn’t  just a big scorekeeper in the sky.  God peers skeptically down over his glasses at us, weighing our actions and passing judgment on our essential worthiness.   God like the vice principal in my middle school, an angry and impatient man who couldn’t wait to slather butch wax on guys whose hair he deemed too long, all the while publically shaming girls with loud harangues about the length of their skirt hems.  If, as a thinking adult, one is able to once finally jettison that view of God….the perverbial baby often goes out with the bathwater.  Whoever God is, we can’t quite figure out rationally how God might be interacting with the world.  God becomes a distant prime mover, a vague spirit-of-something, only marginally involved with the created order.   \\n\\tBut Jesus of Nazareth seemed to have something else in mind when it came to describing God’s nature, even God’s heart and intentions.   We can see it in the things Jesus said to people, in the way he talked with them about their inherent goodness and interacted among them in both a compassionate and challenging manner.  In the way he kept insisting that the Kingdom of God, God’s realm of justice and peace, was essentialy within them.  In today’s passage from the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, we hear Jesus speaking with the crowds during his Sermon on the Mount.  “You are the salt of the earth!” he announces to those gathered around him.  “You are the light of the world!”   “This is who you are.” \\n\\tHis audience, first century Jews, would have immediately heard the insider language here.  We’ve been exploring the image of light in these last few weeks of the Epiphany season; how the ancient Jewish prophets repeatedly reminded people of God’s call to be a light to the world, a beacon of justice and mercy that is so compelling to the other nations that it draws them into an awareness of God’s presence and power.  Here the call to be “salt” is added to Jesus’ challenge.  Salt has served as a ceremonial element in religions around the world, and the ancient Middle East was no exception.  This precious mineral substance had already been mined, produced, tracked for thousands of years by this point.  Besides seasoning and preserving food, salt was ritually used weddings, housewarmings, warding off evil spirits, and legaling sealing certain agreements.  According to Mark Kurlansky’s book Salt: A World History, by Jesus’ time, the human demand for salt had already formed special trade routes, was used as a ceremonial sign of Israel’s covenant with God, was sprinkled on burnt offerings made in the Temple in Jerusalem, and was a commodity controlled and taxed by the occupying Roman Empire.  Even today, Jewish families will dip their Sabbath bread in salt to affirm their on-going covenant with God.  Jesus wasn’t just telling his listeners to become like salt or to become like light and a light to the nations.  Here Jesus used the words: “you ARE.”  You are salt of the earth.  You are the light of the world.  It’s as if he is saying: this is who you are, O Israel, now BE that.  \\n\\tA word of caution, however.  This salt image can lead us into the “do this, do that” trap again.  “Oh, but we might loose our flavor,” I think to myself, worrying about how “I must try and stay salty.”  But I learned this week that it is impossible for the actual chemical of salt to ever get “unsalty.”  It can get mixed up with soil or other impurities or it can melt away and disappear.  But if salt exists, it IS salty.  And Jesus said:  You ARE salt.   And when there is salt, it is salty.  I can almost see Jesus slyly smiling as he says this, almost to imply that we can’t NOT be salt.  Just as we are God’s beloved, we are the salt of the earth.  Here to bring all kinds of enhancement and added taste to life around us.  Here to help preserve life, like salt has been used for ages, all over the world, to preserve vegetables and meats.   Jesus isn’t commanding people to try harder at this; it’s almost like a call to a different self-awareness, a change in consciousness.  Jesus is inviting them to see themselves differently, to take it in, ingest this reality.  Be yourself, he urges them!  Pour yourself out.   Salt, light…parts of the material world that are essential to life….come on, he urges, pour yourself out!\\n\\tBut what makes this “outpouring” happen besides just trying harder to be helpful and nice?  The passage from I Corinthians 2:1-13 can be off-putting, I admit, but it may contain some clues for us.  Admittedly, this is the apostle Paul at some of his more convoluted letter-writing.  He is addressing this church in Corinth where there has been much faithfulness, good work….. and considerable conflict.  He’s doing pastoral trouble-shooting in this letter, based on some feedback he has received from some of the members.  Several weeks ago we read of how he challenged the congregation to stop bickering and join in a unity of mind and purpose.  In today’s portion, he tells them how to get there.  Or how to realize they are there, already.  Paul writes how he decided to “know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.”  He speaks of this in other letters, to other young churches, “preaching only Christ crucified.”  These words can male progressive, even mainline, Christians a tad nervous… especially if it is followed up with allusions to sin being washed in the blood or some other form of blood-price crucifixion theory.  As if this crucifixion talk wasn’t off-putting enough, Paul goes on to contrast human wisdom and God’s wisdom in a way that can almost seem anti-intellectual.  Oh Paul, I find myself complaining, why did you have to make Jesus’ teachings so complicated and off-putting?    \\nI believe Paul is trying to tell us something about God that Jesus knew inherently.  Paul doesn’t say, “I came to preach Jesus Christ triumphant” or even “Jesus resurrected.”  He says:  “I did not com proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words of wisdom” (classical Greek rehetoric).  “I decided to know nothing amoung you expect Christ crucified.”  Is he suggesting that there might be a different way of being in the world….that perhaps God’s power comes to us most clearly in vulnerability, in weakness….not in strength, competitiveness or defensiveness?   Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek, we read in Jesus’ words last week.  “The Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God,” Paul continues in his letter.  “Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.”  Gifts bestowed on us….”you are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world.”  But how do we know this, we ask?  Our very consciousness has changed: and here it is several lines later in verse 16: “we have the mind of Christ.”   \\nCynthia Bourgeault, Episcopal priest, author and contemporary mystic has written this about the “mind of Christ” in her book, Wisdom Jesus:  Paul’s words “call us up short as to what we are actually supposed to be doing on this path (as followers of Jesus): (we are not to be) just admiring Jesus, but acquiring his consciousness….” Seeing with his eyes, learning to respond to the world with that same wholeness and healing love.  Through the practice of prayer and meditation, through soaking in scripture, we are literally taking on the mind of Jesus Christ.  The Spirit thinking with and through us.  Pouring ourselves out as Jesus did, who constantly self-emptied in love, all the way to being crucified.  We are called to that same kind of self-emptying in love, pouring out ourselves as salt and light to the world.   \\nWe might do well to notice the ways we are already salt and light for others, because I’ll bet all of us are.  One of my clergy collegues recently challenged his congregation to keep track for week of all the times they added some flavor or enhancement to someone else’s life.  Keep a salt log, he suggested.  Observe your salty spirit in action;  and perhaps catch others in their acts of “saltiness.”  Keep track of each time someone else adds some enhancement or helps preserve your life. Keep a “salt log” so you can remember who you are:  You are the salt of the earth, says Jesus.\\nAs we watch for ourselves being salt and light, we learn about how God sees us; we come to know our own belovedness as God’s children, as disciples of Jesus.  As this inner “mind of Christ” slowly transforms us, our lives bring into focus the new creation that God is revealing through the Spirit.  We are the salt of the earth; we are the light of the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\nTESTIMONY BY BOB OLSEN\\n\\nIn the winter of 1965 I spent a lot of time outside in the ice and cold. One particular evening I was huddled down in my backyard snow fort, and heard it for the first time – the song in the wind. I lifted my head and shut my eyes, listening, and experienced what I can only describe as the voice of God singing to me. There were no words, just the whooshing of air inside my brown parka hood, through\\xa0my stocking hat.\\n\\nThree years later, I heard it again. I was in the old Northrup Auditorium at the University of Minnesota. I was sitting under the balcony, on the right side of that massive hall, in the next to the last row, back by the pencil-poked acoustical tile rear wall. I was there to hear my teacher, Bob Elworthy who was the principal horn of the Minnesota Orchestra, perform Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony, Symphony 4.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Italian is a great piece of music for the novice music-appreciator like I was. About 17 minutes and 22 seconds into the symphony, the two horns and two bassoons played this exquisite quartet: it sounded far away, over the hill and out of sight; it sounded organic and outdoors-y, it sounded like a place where I wanted to go, where I wanted to be.\\xa0\\n\\nA couple of years later it happened again, only this time it was on the\\xa0stage\\xa0of Northrup Auditorium. My high school choir was asked to perform a work for four orchestras and choirs with the Minnesota Orchestra. The piece, Carre’, was written by the avante-garde composer, Karlheinz Stockhausen. Unlike the Italian Symphony, Carre’ was challenging for any music listener: a piece with no melody, no harmony, and no rhythm. After months of rehearsal, I sat at the concert near the middle of the Northrup stage, behind three sections of horn players and next to a 6’ diameter gong. As our choir performed, the music simultaneously surround me, swirl around me, crash upon me, and suspend me transcendent above the ensemble.\\xa0\\n\\nEach of these moments brought me to be into the presence of God: God the natural force that sings to me in the wind; God that orders the tones of the scale and the harmonies of musical structure; and, God the mystery that swirls around me and takes me to places beyond my imagination. Each of these moments made my hair stand on end and my eyes fill with tears. I was changed. Forever.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTESTIMONY BY PATTI HOLMES\\nWorship in a faith community can take many forms.  While I can find comfort and refreshment from prayer and silent contemplation, my spiritual growth would be lacking if I didn’t have music as part of my Sunday morning worship experience.  Music nourishes my soul and enhances my inner life, and it does so on many levels:\\nFirst, there is the pure beauty of the melodies, rhythmic patterns and harmonies.  These can delight me or sometimes conjure up deep yearnings for divine consolation. As an example of the latter, I think of our Service of Shadows on Maundy Thursday.\\nThen there is the characteristic quality of the sound, be it a solo instrument or voice, or an ensemble or the entire congregation.  The mood and interpretation can inspire me and often give me a recognition of how we are all called to express ourselves, each in our own way, each on our own unique path.\\nAnother aspect of music making in worship is the simple but sublime satisfaction of joining together with other voices and instruments.  To me there is a true merging of souls as we offer up our music to God’s glory.\\nAnd last but definitely not least, there is the meaning behind the lyrics of our hymns and anthems.  My awareness and connection to the lyrics really awakened in me in two separate stages: when I began to teach children’s anthems after coming here in 2004, and also five or so years ago when I began to explore worship music with a social justice message.  That last endeavor has led me to a number of very profound experiences of internalizing the meaning, such as this short verse from a song I found recently:\\nYou know my resting and my rising, You discern my purpose from afar. And with love everlasting you besiege me, in every moment of life or death, you are.\\nAnd, perhaps even more sacred and tender is my recollection of hearing children from our church singing in a mass choir at an ecumenical festival in 2014.  They sang a contemporary setting of the poem, “The Lamb” by William Blake:  I will close with it’s final verse:\\nLittle lamb, I’ll tell thee.\\nLittle lamb, I’ll tell thee.\\nHe is called by thy name,\\nFor he calls himself a Lamb.\\nHe is meek and He is mild,\\nHe became a little child.\\nI a child and thou a lamb,\\nWe are called by his name.\\nLittle lamb, God bless thee.\\nLittle lamb, God bless thee.\\n\\nTESTIMONY BY BRYAN SEYFARTH\\nIn the past few days, the more I have reflected on my relationship between music and faith, the more I have realized the power of that connection for me. Strangely, this was reinforced for me by reflecting on the death this week of Prince, and the incredible outpouring of emotion this has triggered for many people, including myself – I found myself surprisingly affected and moved by his death. \\nFaith is something that I think different people experience, or don’t experience, for many reasons, and one of the reasons that makes it easier for me to have faith is that I am fortunate enough to feel a connection to God, in a deep, intuitive, and completely non-logic-based way. This is not something that I feel all of the time, or even every day, but there are certain places and moments where I intuit a connection to God’s spirit. Two common places come to mind – one is in experiencing moments of nature’s beauty, such as while camping at the Boundary Waters, and another is in experiencing certain moments of music.\\nThe most obvious connection for me is of course singing in the choir each week, as I’ve done now for a couple of years, but it is also in experiencing musical moments from others. One example that sticks out for me is the musical Godspell, the professional production which Susan and I attended years ago, before we even had kids, but still remains vivid in my memory. We were given tickets and went expecting to be entertained, but left feeling touched by God. I was moved there by songs like “Bless the Lord,” which we sang in the choir a few weeks ago, and also a song called “All God’s Gifts,” which I played again this week to prepare for this remarks, and even today it touches me and brings me close to God in a way that I can’t quite articulate. \\nFor me, music is a type of language that can speak to people in ways that aren’t possible with only words. There is an emotional connection possible with music that is sometime like a direct line to the heart, to the emotions, to a sense of wonder or joy about the world, and therefore to my spirituality. \\nIt is easy for me sometimes to get caught up in troubles I may have, or in the troubles I see in the world, but then I come in to church on Wednesday night for choir practice, and nearly every time, in the act of singing with others, there will be some moment where I am reminded of beauty, of hope, and of God’s love. This feeling of being touched, renewed, and even transformed is something I look forward to each week. It binds me to this community, to our church, and helps me as I try to remain focused on those things that truly matter the most in my life. \\n\\nTESTIMONY OF SUE NELSON\\n(see attached file, which is a scan of what she wrote in “Notes” on her Mac)',\n",
       " '\\n\\tToday we are re-imaging what church membership might mean and look like for us in this congregation. Perhaps when we commit to being a member of a local church, we are saying we join with a specific part of the Body of Christ to be part of this reframing of what is at stake in these chaotic times.  We commit to lifting up Biblical values about life together as humans, values that are often contrary to those of the materialism, rugged individualism, marginalization of the weak, domination of the powerful that prevail in our dominant culture.  As members, we join in this prophetic ministry.  As Professor Bruggeman puts it:  “The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us.”\\xa0 (Ibid) This indeed is a tall order.\\n\\n\\tThroughout this disturbing and dispiriting week of national news regarding the US Supreme Court Nomination, I have found myself grieving that we seem unable as a nation to be that beacon of light in the world.  We somehow have become divided into two Americas that, in the recent words of one columnist (Susan B. Glasser), “are growing more enraged by the minute and are not listening to each other.”  Several of you noted in our after-worship discussion last week how important it was for us, as church, to learn how to listen better to one another.  To listen with an open heart, not necessarily in agreement but with the intention to understand what the other person is saying. Listening not with a half ear that is silently preparing a refutation or retort to what has been said.  Perhaps joining a church means, “I’m willing to learn to really listen and share my views respectfully. And in the middle of careful listening, I will lovingly but firmly call out inappropriate behavior when I encounter it.”  Paul describes that for those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.  Which I take to mean we don’t scrutinize, criticize or demean one another’s thoughts or stated beliefs.  But we do hold one another accountable for our behavior. Might this become a part of a membership covenant for us?  \\n\\n\\tIn this context, I think church membership is less about agreeing with certain beliefs about God or Jesus or the Holy Spirit.  It is more about the original meaning of the Greek work belief, credo, which is closer to the verb “to trust.”  Not “do you believe in God as some particular thing, but do you trust in that relationship, in that connection with God?”  Because the work of modeling loving behavior is difficult.   I need to lean into and trust that a power greater than me and my own good brain is informing me, guiding me, transforming me in this work.  I need to trust that my fellow members trust in the power of the living God in their own lives.  As we have witnessed in the recent confirmation hearings, righteous anger, self-protection, shouting and name-calling gets us nowhere except sickened and further divided.  Staying in tough conversations pushes us to trust in discerning a direction broader than our own best thinking.   \\n\\n\\tIn his letters, the Apostle Paul was exploring what it meant to follow the Jesus Way, as it was called in the early first century.  Which was very different from the way of the world, the prevailing Imperial Roman way.  Walter Bruggeman puts it like this:  “In both his teaching and his very presence, Jesus of Nazareth presented the ultimate criticism of the royal consciousness. He has, in fact, dismantled the dominant culture and nullified its claims. The way of his ultimate criticism is his decisive solidarity with marginal people and the accompanying vulnerability required by that solidarity.”\\xa0(Ibid)\\n\\n\\tIf we covenant with a congregation that values justice, peace and compassion, I believe we are saying:  I intend to be in solidarity with those who are marginalized and suffering.  I intend to make myself open to them. Which is not easy, because we have to learn to live with the sense of helplessness and grief that their vulnerability and suffering inevitably brings us.  We join a local church because we know we shouldn’t be doing this work alone.   We sense that something in us has to expand, re-arrange, perhaps even heal within each of our minds to do this work.  We have to grow new capacities for empathy, or as Paul puts it, we have “to be transformed by a renewal of our minds.”  We need to be with other people willing to submit themselves not just to doing good works, but doing the hard inner work of soaking themselves in scripture and immersing themselves in prayer and meditation so this transformation can happen.  Otherwise, our good works can become about our own ego and the need to be seen as helpful.  \\n\\n\\tChurch as a club or cozy community where we get our personal desires addressed and our needs met just is not going to cut it for the 21st century.  I wonder if what we need in our assembly as followers of Jesus are ways to renew our minds so we begin to see the world as Jesus say it. A place where our empathy muscles get nurtured, lovingly challenged and stretched. Not just because we have friends here but also because we encounter people different from us, with different worldviews and life perspectives. \\n\\n\\tI listened to an interview on MPR yesterday with Dr. Michael Thompson, a noted child psychologist who has specialized in researching how boys can be raised to be responsible and caring men.  In the wake of the public testimonies this week, some of us are reflecting on our own adolescent years.  And we are wondering about how, as adults, we might nurture boys to better negotiate the natural risk-taking, sexual exploration and relationship challenges of their teen years.   “It’s about helping teenage boys acquiring empathy,” says Dr.Thompson.  But how does one do that, asked the interviewer.  “We have to actually require empathy,” he replied, “just as a toddler does not naturally share his or her toys, we have to require that they do so when playing with others.”  There need to be consequences for non-empathic behavior!  He went on to describe how the best way to teach empathy to boys is to require that all boys spend some time taking care of young children.  He cited studies done with older teenage boys who had been counselors at sleep-away camps.  Their jobs were to help younger boys through times of homesickness, physical challenges, and learning to be part of a group working together.  The counselors’ empathy rates were much higher than other teens their age that had not spent time taking care of children.  Last Sunday, those working in our Christian Education program put out a call to each of us to help out with the Sunday School program with our children here.  Might one of the commitments as members of a church be the willingness to further develop our own empathy as adults as we take turns working with our children?  Might we be a place where the older boys in our community learn empathy by assisting with these programs?  How do you and I as members of a church actively envision a future where teenage boys learn about other people’s feelings, about consent, about respecting women and girls?  \\n\\n\\t“The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us.”\\xa0 As church members we get to say yes to such prophetic ministry.  We say yes to living into this ministry together.  Let’s keep exploring what this might mean for us as a congregation.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Talking about money is rarely easy.  As a child visiting my proper and Victorian-like grandparents, I learned that it was considered impolite to talk about money at the dinner table.   Fortunately, my parents had other ideas and I grew up in a household that spoke frequently and openly about money.  I also have come to realize I shared in a certain privilege as part of a middle class white family growing up, certainly not of my own doing.  There was always enough money for things like food, seeing the dentist, and repairing our family car.  \\n\\nBut throughout my ministry, I have noticed a hesitancy to talk about money in churches I have served.  Certainly, most of us can dive into budget talk in a business like manner, with facts and figures being common ground from our everyday work world.  But there is a reserve in talking about personal finances, and what that may mean to each of us.  And a decided avoidance of serving on Stewardship committees!   A reluctance to invite people to give more generously. Perhaps in an effort to dissociate ourselves from some of the more crass and invasive money appeals in some congregations.  Everyone seems to have a story about how another Christian denomination harassed a friend or relative to give sacrificially.  Accusations of misuse of funds can start flying in some churches.  Sometimes these are well founded.  Sometimes money conflict is about something else:  different visions of what the church and its leadership should be in the 21st century, mistrust of leadership, fear and despair about where a church is headed, a sense of loss and grief about the church and world of the past that no longer exists.  Money is a tender topic.  We are even less likely to talk about what how our attitudes towards money and how our dealing with money relates to our faith life.  \\n\\nI find this rather curious, because given the Gospel record, Jesus appeared to have talked a lot about money.  His references and stories about money, riches and poverty far exceed his attention to much of what is considered the “family values agenda” of today.  If we are counting, 11 out of 39 parables are about money.  Which is both good news….and sort of bad news, for us.  Good news because Jesus’ teachings on money provide us with some guidance as we navigate our financial lives.  Bad news because the guidance is quite challenging….and might even annoy us.\\n\\nThis Matthew text from our Common Lectionary, scriptures read in Protestant and Catholic churches around the world today, offers one of Jesus more subtle teachings about the meaning and power of money.  Earlier in his ministry, Jesus had spoken frequently about our heart being where our treasure is.  But at this point in his ministry, I see Jesus pushing deeper into how money affects relationships…with God and with other people.  In this particular story, Jesus continues to go head-to-head with the local religious leaders.  Today it is the Pharisees, scholars and teachers of the Jewish law, and the Herodians, who were Jewish members of the ruling class, closely aligned with the Romans, of the royal court of King Herod.  Jesus opponents are not evil people, but pressured leaders, under the thumb of Roman imperial rule.  Both the Pharisees and the Herodians were trying to keep their persecuted Jewish community “under the radar” of the local authorities.  Jesus is a big problem for them; he keeps drawing crowds, keeps championing the poor, the outcasts, the low-life.  \\n\\nThe religious and political leaders approach Jesus again and try to trap him with this tricky question about paying taxes to the emperor.  In reply, Jesus asks them to produce a coin.  For whatever reason, Jesus didn’t have any cash on hand.  But apparently, the Pharisees did.  Since this conversation is happening within the Temple grounds, there is an immediate problem.  Roman money was considered impure and no observant Jew would carry something considered impure, ritually unclean, into their center of worship, the Temple in Jerusalem.  Upon entering the Temple grounds, one would change Roman money for Temple coinage.  You could then move into the area where you could purchase an offering, an animal to be sacrificed or put some of your money in an alms box for the poor. \\n\\nJesus’ challengers are waiting for his answer.  “Anyone have a coin?” Jesus asks casually.  One of the Pharisees pulls out a denarius, a Roman coin embossed with an image of the current emperor.  This coin would have borne the inscription: “Tiberius Caesar, august son of the divine Augustus” on one side and “high priest” on the other.   Already we get a whiff of the dilemma faced by the current religious leaders themselves: they have carried into the Temple court, and are using, coinage that is basically blasphemous in their own faith tradition.  Or, we might add, they are seeking to trick Jesus and now Jesus has called them out.\\n\\nBefore the making of coins in human history, there was simply the trading of goods or the exchange of other goods of value.  But apparently, it was the Egyptian pharaohs who were the ones to first devise something more symbolic: a system of the warehouse receipt.  My family could bring in a bunch of grain to the government warehouse and be paid with a receipt, which could later be exchanged for other goods, all backed up not just by our grain but also by the whole storehouse of grain.  The big deal here was that trust was now being extended from the pile of grain to the organization that watched over all the grain.  From the beginning, money, coinage, has had to do with extending trust to something larger than oneself or one’s resources.   Money.  Trust.\\n\\nI think of how we experienced a huge loss of trust, as a nation, in our financial institutions during this last decade.  I am reminded of the loss of trust in families, or between friends, when a loan is not repaid.  Loss of trust around financial management can become an issue in churches. On a congregational level, stopping the accusations, being careful of assumptions, sorting through the details, maintaining accountability, regaining trust, is not a quick, easy process.  Money talk in churches can be difficult.  We all know how different views about other things can get entangled with our financial discussions:  different values that we hold, different views about the future of the church, different assumptions about the roles of church leadership.  We sometimes argue about money management because it is difficult to talk honestly, and with vulnerability, about our other differences.     \\n\\nEssentially, the Pharisees and the Herodians were trying to ask Jesus an important question:  What has authority, in your life, Jesus?  Who do you really trust and pay homage to?   What, who do you serve?  In a world that idolizes materialism and the accumulating of all the many things that money can buy, this continues to be a question for us.   In this parallel passage from the apostle Paul’s letter to the Thessalonians, we hear the Paul addressing a similar question.  In his letter to this church, he commends the congregation for the way they have shifted their trust, their allegiances.  They no longer worship the various idols offered them in their cosmopolitan, sophisticated urban center of Thessalonica.  Something about their common allegiance to and trust in God, and the mutually trusting way they are with one another as a church, has become an example “to all the believers” in the surrounding regions.  The way members of a congregation are with one another, what they trust and give allegiance to, can be a powerful witness to the wider world. \\n\\n“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and give to God what is God’s,” announced Jesus as he held up the Roman coin. Jesus answer gave the Pharisees and Herodians pause.  But the thing that may have finally silenced them and caused them to depart in shock, was the realization that Jesus has pushed the allegiance question to a whole other level.  Basically, the coin of Jesus’ day stated: In Caesar we trust.  Or, to put it more bluntly, we trust in a powerful, rich human.  What Jesus did in his encounter with the leaders of his day was to challenge the notion that Caesar was Lord.  When early Christians later proclaimed, “Jesus is Lord” they were actually making a dangerous political statement about where they put their trust.  Not Caesar, but Jesus is Lord!  \\n\\nIn this particular encounter with the Pharisees and Herodians, Jesus subtly subverts both the emperor’s authority and our assumptions that our money is just about us.  “Render to God what is God’s.”  His listeners would hear the connection Jesus was making: Ultimately, everything we have is God’s: our property, our family, our job, our church, our money…. Are we idolizing resentment and fear when we deal with money, in our home or in our church?  Or am we serving “the living and true God” who invites our full allegiance?  These are challenging texts today, leaving us much to ponder this week.  As we pull out our wallets and billfolds, fingering the cash and the credit cards this week, we are invited to consider the question:  Am I rendering to God what is God’s?  May all our transactions serve this “living and true God.”   Amen.  \\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tIn Jesus time, it was nothing new to say that God forgives.  Within the Jewish tradition and Hebrew scriptures, God was constantly re-building bridges between Godself and careless, rebellious, sinful humans.   When it came to broken relationships between humans, much was also written in Jewish law about forgiveness between people:  the injured person had an ethical responsibility to forgive the one who committed the offense.  The injured party was even to pray to God that God would forgive the offender, even before the offender acknowledged the offending behavior and repented.  These were high standards indeed.  Jesus intuited that forgiveness is connected with our emotional and spiritual health.  He would needle and provoke people into wrestling with the full implications of their own tradition around forgiveness.  One day, he is approached by one of his closest disciples, Peter.  “Uh, Jesus? Our religious teachers say we should forgive people 7 times….that sure is a lot!  What about that?”  Replies Jesus, “you are to forgive 70 times 7 times!”  I’m sure Peter was sorry he asked.  On another day, Jesus, said Pray like this: “And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us.”  But forgiveness is hard, Jesus!  Yes, he would probably reply.  I think this part of the prayer is a time bomb.\\t\\n\\tForgiveness has to do with how we co-exist with the past where mistakes and injury have been made.  I would say that forgiveness is not the immediate concern when a transgression is still happening:  the battered wife should not be forgiving the husband who keeps beating her; she needs to find a safe way for her and her children to exit the immediate danger.  Stopping the offense is always the first thing that needs to happen.  I think that this part of the Lord’s Prayer deals with the messiness of life when an offense has stopped, because someone died or someone left or others have stepped in to call a halt.  This part of the Lord’s Prayer deals with human fallibility, people’s tendency to miss the mark in ethical behavior, intentionally or unintentionally.  Human sinfulness.  If we chose not to resort to retaliation or retribution, how do we move on?  What do we do with the memories of what has happened, especially since it is impossible to forget?  \\n\\tThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke each recorded this part of the Lord’s Prayer a bit differently, as you can see from the Biblical quotes on the front of your bulletin.  In this congregation, we usually pray Matthew’s version:  And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.  Jesus taught that our sinfulness against God, our resistance to God leading us, puts us in debt to God, in a very real sense.  It is a debt that we just can’t pay back.  We all have to fall on God’s merciful forgiveness. Some Biblical scholars maintain that “debts” may come closest to Jesus’ original words in the prayer.  \\n\\tJesus’ original audience would hear “debt” and remember the stories of their ancestor’s release from debt-slavery in Egypt.  They would remember the teachings from Deuteronomy we just heard:  Within their communities and covenant with God, there was to be a rhythm of every seven years of release from debt, a Sabbath or Sabbatical year.  Just like the rhythm of releasing your land from plantings by letting them lay fallow, debts should be forgiven and slaves were to be released.  The reminder was always this:  Pharaoh’s Egypt was not just.  The Israelites, the people of God, are not to become another Egypt.  Could “forgive us our debts as we forgives our debtors” also have to do with our part in the justice realm of the Kingdom of God, the Household of God?  Are we to make sure there are enough for everyone in God’s House and not too much debt-weighing people down?   Was Jesus implying a double meaning here?  Was he just as concerned about economic inequity as he was about the build-up of unforgiven resentments?  Such a short phrase, “forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.” A simple petition now gets more complicated!\\n “Not seven times, but, I tell you, 77 times” replies Jesus.  And after giving this absurdly high number, Jesus proceeds to tell a story about literal financial debt. And it is a dire story of a harsh king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.  After much pleading, once heavily in-debt slave is finally forgiven his debt (the equivalent of about $25 million – listeners take note of the extreme exaggeration –watch Jesus wink at us) by the relenting king.  But then this slave has the audacity to turn around and imprison a fellow slave who owes him a small amount of money (the equivalent of about $50.….notice the contrast?).  His fellow slaves are understandably distressed by this double standard and inform the king.  Infuriated, the king orders the slave tortured until he presents the money he is concealing and repays his entire debt.  The story ends rather ominously with Jesus suggesting that God will do this to us if we do not forgive our brothers and sisters from our hearts.  Yikes.  This is Jesus at his storytelling best – full of hyperbole and exaggeration to make a point.  \\n\\tSome of you might remember a novel from a few years ago called The Shack, by William P. Young.  It is an unsettling story of a man who, I’m not sure how else to describe this, “meets God.”  His life is miserable, as he is trying to cope with the kidnapping and apparent murder of his young daughter.  Several years after the girl’s disappearance, the distraught and grieving father receives an anonymous summons to travel to an abandoned wilderness cabin related to his daughter’s abduction.  Cautious and curious, there he has an astounding encounter with…..well, as odd as this may sound…..the three persons of the Holy Trinity.  Whether this is in a dream or in an altered state or happens in real time, the reader doesn’t quite know.  But God in three persons shows up as an older woman called Papa, a youngish male carpenter called Jesus and a strangely vibrant, multi-colored and somewhat transparent mostly gender neutral apparition who is the Spirit.  These three beings each talk with the bereaved father, they eat meals together, they sing, they walk around, they talk and eat some more.  Much of their discussion is about forgiveness, which, as you may well imagine, does not sit well with this grieving parent who would happily kill the man who murdered his daughter.  \\n\\tAt one point the Jesus figure says to the angry father:  “Forgiveness is not about forgetting.  It is about letting go of another persons’ throat.”  I was struck by this image.  There have certainly been times when I have had both of my hands around someone’s’ throat, even if it is only in my imagination.  When this happens to us, both hands are busy with hanging on, and not available for much else.  And when we keep verbalizing these unforgiving feelings, telling our grievance story again and again, others experience a sort of second-hand violence.  Still finding yourself complaining about a previous pastor, a certain group in the church or a specific lay leader?   I would say this kind of talk is damaging; it fouls the air around us as a church.  How willing are we to let-go, and in the releasing, open up some clear airspace within us and between us?  And here’s the clincher, according to Jesus: The space and energy taken up by our unforgiveness inhibits our ability to engage in God’s forgiveness of us.  \\n\\tHere is the challenge of Jesus’ vision: if I have a falling out with my fellow human, can I come to see that person as worth-ful, in spite of the wrongdoing?  If not, I have not cleaned up my part of it.  It’s all about connection within a wider threat of creation.  And I am going to have trouble connecting with God. Not because God rejects me; I’m just not in much of a receiving mode.  My own unforgiving attitude blocks the channel of forgiveness.  My hands are still around that person’s throat.  My hands (and heart) are not open and available to join with God’s, nor are they really available to help anyone else.   Perhaps we have difficulty forgiving ourselves for something we did, or didn’t do.  Strange to think of our hands around our own throats isn’t it?  Perhaps we think this gives us some sense of control of the past situation, if we keep punishing ourselves….but, wow, it sure consumes a lot of energy.  And again, my hands and heart are not free.\\n\\tForgiveness not only frees our hands up, it helps us recover our energies and our personal power, our integrity.   “Pray like this,” said Jesus:  “Forgive us our debts, our trespasses, our sins, as we forgive our debtors, those who trespass, sin against us.”  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHow is it that people first start thinking about God?  Some people report that they had some kind of mystical or numinous experience of an Other as a child.  Often out in nature, they had a unitive feeling of deep connection with nature and all that is.  Some people describe having a vision, hearing a voice, or a sensing strong inner feeling of a powerful presence.  Think back to your own childhood.  Did an experience of God’s mystery come first?  Or perhaps, there was someone in your life who spoke about God in a natural, even informal way. Not all of us had this gift early on, of an adult who could speak of a sense of deep connection with a power greater than themselves, and could actually talk about this intimacy.  Maybe you observed this person talking to God, praying, in your presence.  What was your relationship with this person like?  How did this person describe God to you?  \\n\\n\\tThroughout this month-long exploration of our beliefs, I will invite us to consider both our experiences of this mystery we call God, and also our thinking about God.  Our brain is constantly trying to make sense out of what we are intuiting, imagining, feeling or not feeling about God’s presence in our lives and the world around us.  And we are part of a long tradition that values the way our brain can think about God, but our brain is not the only way we actually experience God.  \\n\\n\\tTalking about beliefs always seems to make people nervous, particularly in mainline, liberal congregations.  Many people are drawn to a church like FHCUCC because they are tired of denominations where they were told what they must believe to belong, or worse, were ridiculed, shamed, even rejected for some kind of “false” belief.   Many of us cringe when faced with a “test” about our beliefs.  Some stranger, or family members, asks: “do you know where you spend eternity” or “are you born again?”  We don’t want to push our perspectives on someone else, and most assuredly don’t want to be perceived as proselytizing.  But I have come to see that there is a problem in our reticence to discuss our beliefs and our experiences of God with one another.\\n\\n\\tAnthony B. Robinson is a long-time United Church of Christ pastor and author, who has done a lot of work of figuring out what makes for healthy congregations (see What’s Theology Got to Do with It?).  He has noticed that a lot of the research and writing about re-vitalizing congregations has focused on three areas: first, systems theory and how families, organizations, churches all work as a connected, interactive system.  Research has also come from leadership studies as they relate to organization health.  And finally, on conflict resolution within groups and organizations.  But as Robinson has looked back over his years of ministry in the church, he realized that the way out of most problems he and his churches faced was to focus on “theological teaching and conviction.”  (p. 3)  \\n\\n\\tCareful as you hear this.  Robinson does not mean focusing on some specific “correct” way to talk about God and to believe in God.  He’s concerned that we have simply stopped talking among ourselves about our own experience of and thinking about God.  What would God have our church do next?  Discerning this becomes a very difficult process if folks aren’t already openly talking about their faith!  Your Discovery Team, eight members who are helping me lead the self-exploration part of our interim process together, has invited you all to consider the beliefs that you share as congregation.  They decided to use the UCC Statement of Faith, which is in your church constitution, as a grounding point for those decisions.  The Team is seeking to understand your shared beliefs not so we can police the edges for doctrinal purity. \\xa0If that were so, we could all call up our inner adolescent right now, fold our arms defiantly and say, “no one can tell me what to believe!”  What the Discovery Team is doing is helping you to identify and better embrace the center of who you are as a congregation.   The center, I would say, is essentially theological:  it is language about God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the church and scripture that identify who you are as a unique congregation.  It is language that should provide the center of your life as a church, and your on-going daily round through each week of your life.\\n\\n\\tRobinson writes in his book What’s Theology Got to Do with It?  that  “when we are reasonably clear about our core convictions and their relevance to our life and purpose as a church, chances of vitality are great.  Conversely, where we are fuzzy about our core convictions and unsure of their meaning or value, disarray is likely.  Organizations, including congregations, that lack norms and convictions and the ability to interpret their ongoing significance for their life and mission, are organizations that are likely to be ingrown, conflicted, and driven (often off the road and into a ditch) by personalities of leaders and members.”  \\n\\n\\tHere’s the challenge for us:  it’s not that “anything goes” around here.  Churches like Falcon Heights Church have to get clear about what they proclaim as the “good news” and be able to talk about it openly.  It’s no longer enough to say we are a friendly church, we welcome everyone, and we do lots of good works.  A lot of local community centers and non-profits do the same.  What’s distinctive here?   What are the core theological convictions that mold your life, draw you into the ups and downs of Christian fellowship, guide your relationship with God and deepen your sense of God’s purpose for your life?  The challenge for the church, continues Robinson, is not new techniques or tricks to attract young people.   It’s about what we “believe and confess and the difference it makes” in our lives. (p. 4)\\t\\n\\n\\tThe Discovery Team decided to use the UCC Statement of Faith to lead us into this exploration.  This statement was written right after the two congregations that came together, the Evangelical and Reformed Churches and the Congregational Christian churches, to form the United Church of Christ in 1957.  It’s different from traditional creeds, because it is not intended to be a “test” of faith.  It is more a testimony offered to the local churches, so we might be encouraged to each search our own minds and declare our own convictions.  And, of particular importance to this congregation, it was included in Article II of the Falcon Heights Church Constitution, which reads:  “While granting each member the freedom to interpret God’s Truth as God give each of them light and wisdom, the church recognizes and accepts as the basis of our common purpose, faith and covenant found in the Statement of Faith adopted at the Second General Synod (of the UCC).”   This Statement has been read in worship in unison through the years here, as it is in many UCC churches across the country.\\n\\n\\tI invite us now to read together the front of the bulletin.  I suggest you read all of the words, even if you are not sure if this is what you exactly believe.  Try them out in your mouth; hear the sound of the words.  Perhaps take a pencil and mark the phrases that are particularly meaningful to you.  Mark the lines that raise questions or just don’t feel right to you. \\nWe believe in you, O God, Eternal Spirit,\\nGod of our Savior Jesus Christ and our God,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and to your deeds we testify:\\nYou call the worlds into being,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0create persons in your own image,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and set before each one the ways of life and death.\\nYou seek in holy love to save all people from aimlessness and sin.\\nYou judge people and nations by your righteous will\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0declared through prophets and apostles.\\n \\n\\tYou may notice as we wend our way through this section that the statement doesn’t spend a lot of time saying who God “is.”  It talks a lot about what God “does” – God’s deeds in the world.   God “calls” everything into being, including us, and we are created in God’s image.  We get this choice, each day, between following the ways of life-giving or engaging in things that are deadening.  Everyday, new choices.  God seeks in holy love.  And here’s a line that probably sticks in some of our craws: to save all people from aimlessness and sin.  Now there is nothing wrong in my mind with a bit of non-focused aimlessness, especially on a warm summer day when we are trying to take a break from all our darn productiveness.  This is called Sabbath, and we better be taking it!  But aimlessness also reflects that contemporary sense of emptiness or lack of purpose that is very real.  And I do believe we all make mistakes; we sin.  We hurt people and ourselves and the planet.  Intentionally and by accident.  And it is good to name it, confess it and seeks one anther’s forgiveness.  Then, this final sentence with the word judge usually sends many people off the cliff.  Judgmental, vengeful, fearful and punishing – we want nothing to do with this, or people that do this in God’s name.  Yes.  Of course.  But the judgment declared by the prophets and the apostles was always less about individual sins and more about the sins of nations and ruling elites.  God’s judgment is a restorative judgment, seeking to bring healing and justice and hope to our communal experience.  \\n\\n\\tLot’s to think about and explore here.  I invite you to join us in the Gathering Room for some discussion on this section about God.  Take the bulletin home and mull over these words this week.  Where do you experience God calling you, creating, seeking, saving and judging with loving discernment?   To be continued…. Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'I find that this slow journey toward Christmas, filled with otherworldly and mysterious scripture readings, candlelight and haunting Advent hymns, gives me a place to pause if I let it.   I am invited to step back in the midst of hectic preparations to ask myself: “What is God preparing in me?”  “What am I noticing about my inner self this season?” In what ways are we each being delved, purified and widened in order that we might “grasp a far larger understanding of God’s truth?” (p. 15, Proclamation, Year C, Advent-Christmas).   \\nThe prophetic song of Zechariah, gives us a context in which we can begin to understand and live into Advent more fully.  This hymn of prophecy and praise comes from the lips of John the Baptist’s father, who was a priest in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem before Jesus was born.  In his advanced age, Zechariah has been visited by the angel Gabriel and told that he and his childless wife Elizabeth will bear a son.  This son will “be called the prophet of the Most High” and “will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.”  After Zechariah’s initial shock and skepticism, these joyous words explode out of his mouth at John’s birth.  Zechariah speaks of God’s tender mercies which will be poured out over the people:  “Dawn from on high will break upon us.”  “Light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.”  Guidance for “our feet in the way of peace.”\\nThis “way of peace” becomes clear as we move further into Luke’s gospel. Here we are faced with the challenging words of adult John the Baptist and his call to repentance.  Moving outside Jerusalem to the River Jordan, he demands that the his curious on-lookers move outside of their traditional religious practices and “prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”  He is relentless, demanding both individual and communal self-examination.  “In what ways do I have to repent,” I found myself wondering.  “In what ways do I need to turn away from something, to ask forgiveness about, this season?”  John the Baptist preached that we repent for the forgiveness of our sins.  Sin.  That is a loaded word, no?  Perhaps one that has faded from our discussions and worship language in many more liberal leaning congregations.  We understandably want to lean into the radical acceptance and love of God, and avoid the shaming, demeaning manner of condemning people for their behavior.  We hope that talking about love and being polite is enough to guide our life together in the church.  And yet in this reduction of sin to a list of polite “do’s and don’t’s” we may have lost a sense of sin’s complexity.  We neglect looking at the way sin becomes embedded in wider systems of our communal life together.  If repentance is truly “turning around,” I wonder how a congregation might think about sin and repenting together as a body? \\nThis might be something to explore in our interim time together.   Anthony B. Robinson, author and minister in the United Church of Christ, has written about healthy churches and the role of sin in congregational life.  In his book, What’s Theology Got to do with it? Convictions, Vitality and the Church, he bluntly names “the three particular ways sin disfigures congregational life today:  leadership failure, abuse of power and bullying, and the adoption of a victim mentality.” (p. 101).   Robinson is a strong advocate for congregational healing, calling for us to take “sin more seriously, name it accurately and speak of it truthfully.”  Not finger-pointing or name calling….but perhaps a prayerful and compassionate consideration of the parts we each play in systems that are hurting.  And not just congregations, but also the systems of our work places, families, marriages, friendships.   “Sin is not the same as ‘messing up,’” or making a mistake, writes Robinson, and “reflecting theologically (on these realities) does not always bring agreement.” (p. xi)  But as we soak in scripture, and explore the Biblical narratives, we can better see how “God’s story is revealed through specific activities of the faith community.”  What is “church”? What does Biblical authority mean to you?  What about the Trinity? Sin? The sacraments of baptism and communion?  What does it mean to be saved?  We might do well to read Robinson’s book together in this interim time.  \\n             The Biblical truth is that Advent is both a somber and joyfilled time, and I thank God for that.  Amid the gaiety and indulgences of the season, we are reminded of God’s purpose for humanity:  we are to be reflective of our own lives and actions.  This Advent, God is preparing us for a deeper understanding of the mysteries and the possibilities of our life together as people of faith.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'There once was a United Methodist pastor who was discussing Palm Sunday palm branches with his congregation’s worship committee.  “Our budget is tight this year, and you know those leafy palm fronds cost us about a dollar apiece…” cautiously began one committee member.  “That’s right,” someone else quickly chimed in, “Is there any way we can avoid paying a buck a branch this year?”  Their pastor reluctantly admitted that of all four gospels in the New Testament, only the Gospel of John talks about palms during Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  Mark and Matthew speak only of cloaks and branches being strewn, and this reading from Luke only mentions the cloaks covering Jesus’ path.  Someone suggested waving native pussy willow branches that year.  “The heck with the branches,” said another, “let’s just toss our overcoats into the aisles and call it “Cloak Sunday!”  What was so special about palm branches, anyway, the committee wondered?    \\nFor those of us living in the land of hardwood and evergreen trees, the symbolic significance of palm trees may be a bit obscure.   There had been other palm-branch waving parades in the life of the Middle Eastern Jewish people, but they usually marked a significant military success.  For the crowds in Jerusalem on this particular Passover feast week, memories would have been fresh of the Jewish Maccabean revolt against the brutal Hellenistic ruler of Israel, Antiochus Epiphanies, about 150 years before.  When the Maccabees returned triumphant into Jerusalem, re-taking the city, people threw palm branches in their path.  But here we have Jesus, in about 33 CE, performing his own bit of street theater with a non-military and even ridiculous looking entry on a scrappy donkey.  Do the crowds think he will be a militant Messiah, bringing down the Romans with violence?  Or, are they joining in on the political satire, throwing palms of victory down on the ground before him and thumbing their collective noses at the Roman soldiers.   \\nThese people are living in their own land, visiting their own holy city of Jerusalem, but it is now dominated by an oppressive power.  We might think of the original native inhabitants of our own country felt or those in the “conquered” American South at the end of the Civil War.  There are people in our nation today who experience themselves as living in an alienated land. They remain convinced that their government and major institutions seek to insidiously thwart their religious practices and destroy their way of life.  They hunger for an end to their oppressed state and even hint at re-claiming their country by force if necessary.   \\nThe crowds who watched Jesus enter Jerusalem were straining against the increasing tax burden and offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Roman rule.  Statues of Roman leaders had been installed in their house of worship, the rebuilt Temple, which was particularly repugnant to the local population.  Caesar was to be addressed as “the Son of God.”  What may be difficult for us to appreciate is how very closely their political situation was of deep religious concern to Jesus’ contemporaries.  It is within this complex, first century historical context, that we need to hear the Biblical narratives of Holy Week.  \\nNow, the Jews knew about exile:  they had returned to their country Israel after the crushing period of exile under Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE.  The writings of the prophets grappled with the people’s sense of abandonment by God by calling for repentance, spiritual renewal and social justice.  For several hundred years, the Jews were again sovereign people, had rebuilt their Temple and reorganized their lives around the guidance of God’s holy Law described in the Torah.   But by the time of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE and through Roman occupation of Jesus’ time, “the Jews faced a new and different trauma,” that had both political and religious ramifications.  The Maccabean revolt around 150 BCE was only a short-lived blip.  \\nThe Biblical scholar Paula Fredriksen describes this dilemma in her book, From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus.  She writes: “nothing in their tradition prepared them to cope with the crisis of continuing occupation.  Instead of an exile in an idolatrous kingdom, Jews now faced the situation of living in an alienated land.  Their land was now ruled by idolaters whose policies could at any time affect the operation of the Temple itself and the populace’s ability to observe the ordinances of the Torah” (p. 77-78).  It is within this context of popular unrest, explains Fredriksen, that the public ministry of Jesus unfolds (p. 82). There was a growing expectation that God was going to intervene, militarily, make things right again and re-install the Davidic monarchy.\\nWe can begin to get a sense of how Jesus’ audiences resonated with his preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  They would have understood him primarily through the lens and the longings of this very prevalent theology of restoration. It had evolved into a hope for universal renewal; restored Israel and a world filled with morally transformed, non-idol worshipping Gentiles.  Prophetic visioning began to happen all over the place, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare.  They believed they were living in the last days, preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists, rainmakers, performing signs and wonders that were a signal both of their intimacy with God and as pointing to the End Times, all were common in this period.  \\nBut Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  This restoration was not going to happen through military might, or excluding certain people, or fencing people out.  This restoration involved the transformation of the human heart and soul, a change of perception and behavior that gets at the very root of our yearning for power over others.  Jesus’ vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that found his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation.\\nJesus heads to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish Passover.  It was the commemoration of Jews challenging and escaping from dictatorial rule and oppression in ancient Egypt, many years before.  This was a festival drenched with political meaning, allusions to challenging power and facing down Empire.  Scholars say that the city population would swell from 5000 to 200,000 during Passover; no repressive regime likes to see such crowds anytime and particularly not when there are celebrating release from slavery.  No wonder Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, leaves his seaside villa and makes the trek to inland Jerusalem for this week.  He has to keep a close eye on things to assure stability.  Suddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he raises the dead, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   Heads turn and the crowd cheers.  People are now singing hosannas and throwing their cloaks on the road, waving palm branches in the air, and welcoming Jesus like royalty.  \\nIf we are paying attention, off in the distance we might spot a group of people for whom this is not just a happy holiday, pilgrim parade.  The men and women who have been traveling with Jesus as his disciples know he is in danger; his message is subversive and it challenges those in power.  His followers have an inkling that this may not end well.  And we know it doesn’t.  All the ugly detail starts to roll through our collective memories again:  Jesus humbling himself, not resisting arrest, submitting to questioning, trial, torture; 3 crosses on the hill, and the darkening sky.  Seemingly powerless.\\n How very tempting it is to quickly move to the “new life” messages of Easter and miss the depths of restoration to which Jesus will call us.  It is an ongoing challenge for us to find meaning in present suffering and powerlessness, to find hope for a changed future.  Our lives do sometimes feel like an “alienated land” and we long for restoration.  There are those among us these days who promise that restoration for our land will come through repressive, exclusionary, even violent means.  Humbling, pouring ourselves out, including the marginalized seems almost counter-intuitive in this clash of current voices.  \\nAt the conclusion of today’s passage, Jesus moves into the heart of Jerusalem; he takes a closer look at the city and weeps over it.   “If you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace,” he moans.  The ambiguity and turbulence of Holy Week will bring complicated themes of life and death.  It will confront us again with the question of God’s awesome and restorative presence in the midst of human suffering. Always the realist, Jesus knew it is not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  There he is, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death….even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us; we follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tAs part of my study leave last week, I participated in a youth ministry conference up in CT at at Yale Divinity School.  The large hall was filled with a racially diverse group of young and older youth leaders and senior ministers, Christian educators and a mix of lay leaders; people from wealthy communities such as Darien and Greenwich, as well the struggling inner city poverty found in Bridgeport, inner city Hartford and New Haven.  Researchers and theologians from across the country talked with us about how kids today are paradoxically portrayed as the most spoiled, entitled, even narcissistic generation ever….but who also have an increasing decline in their mental and emotional health.  Each of the speakers, and countless stories around our discussion tables, spoke of our “systemic abandonment” of our young, and what the church needs to do about it.  If growing into adulthood is in part learning “who I am” and figuring out how I am a unique, gifted person connected with society, then we are in massive trouble, says Chap Clark, an adolescent and family scholar who has listened to kids for 3 decades.  “We train them to define themselves by how they contribute; we have connected their identity primarily to performance, even in the church,” he insisted, “and every human longs to be something deeper than being just a performer.”  The diagnosis was both spot-on and painful to hear; I’m looking forward to the months ahead when we, as a congregation, explore how this relates to life in northern VA suburbs and what to do about it.  How do we help our young people thrive, and in doing so, learn more creatively how to thrive ourselves?   And what does Christian thriving look like?\\nThe apostle Paul, in his letter to the churches in Galatia, is working with this new identity reality in the passage we just heard from chapter 3.  Paul and the growing number of non-Jews and Gentiles drawn to the Christian faith was debating: Do non-Jewish Christians need to follow Jewish law? do the new believers have to be circumcised if they are men?  Do they have to follow Jewish dietary rules?  Paul insists that through our welcoming of the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ into our hearts, by confessing Christ, we are in Paul’s words, “all children of God through faith.”  This is how we are forgiven, justified, received into God’s presence as children who are welcomed by a loving Parent.  This is how we thrive as followers of Jesus Christ; tot by adhering to certain rules of conduct. That is who we are, insists Paul: God’s children, God’s kin. \\n\\tAnd divisions of culture, status and gender are dissolved in this common kinship with one another, says the Paul.   “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.” But notice that right before launching into this much quoted inclusive vision, Paul writes a curious thing:  “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”  \\n\\tThis image probably sounds a bit odd to us.  “Clothed with Christ?” Apparently, in the region of Galatia, power and prestige came from being a Roman citizen, specifically a male Roman citizen.  All young men born of Roman citizens throughout the Empire were given a new garment at age 16 in a special public coming of age ceremony.  The Roman “toga virilis” was some 20 yards of fine white wool cloth.   It was wrapped around the young man and worn throughout his life as an outer garment that signified to all his citizenship and elite social status.   We may be more empowering of our 16 year old girls today, but besides getting your drivers’ license or ability to drink alcohol, I believe we have lost compelling communal signs of adulthood.  The Roman toga gave the young man a sense of identity, autonomy and power, as well as belonging, all crucial developmental tasks in attaining adulthood.  \\n\\tFamiliar with this Roman tradition, Paul uses this clothing metaphor to speak of our life with Christ.  To the church at Colossae, another Asia Minor city, he had written:  “you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourself with the new self which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator” (Colossians 3:10).   As Christians, we come to one another with distinctions of status, wealth, skin color, background now cloaked, clothed, by our new identity in Christ.  And our very selves are now subject to a transformative power within this being clothed in Christ.  Parts of our old self, habits and attitudes that no longer serve God’s purposes, slowly being stripped away as our new self in constantly renewed “according to the image of” the Risen Jesus Christ.  How might this empower young people, and us, to be more creative and bold in our actions in the world?\\n\\tWe could each imagine in our mind’s eye what were we clothed with before we began to encounter God’s transformative power in our life.  Are there some past “cloaks” we have each been able to shed?  Can you see a cloak of your old life?  Is it ragged and torn?  Stinky, heavy or dark?  Perhaps it is gaudy flashy bright, perhaps hard and armor-like?  Can you picture it?  It may not have fully disappeared.  Transformation is an evolving process.  Do you find yourself taking the old cloak back on occasionally?    Perhaps you are at a point where you have yet to welcome the spirit of the living God into your heart, and have yet to know yourself “clothed with Christ.”  Maybe today is a beginning for you.    \\n\\tLet’s return to this story we just heard, about a man doesn’t have any clothes on at all.  In this strange tale Jesus encounters a man suffering from demon possession.  Or mental illness.  We don’t know.  Whatever, he is out of his mind, filthy and naked, shackled by his community and then banished out into the tombs of the local graveyard.  He is estranged from his very self, unable to remember his own name and cognizant only of the legions, the thousands of demons, clamoring within him.  Chap Clark describes that one of the major problems for teens today is that they have to maintain so many alternative identities to navigate their world:  perform as one person with their teachers, be another person to please their sports coach, another to mollify their parents and a bunch of other selves depending on which friends they are texting.  Talk about “legion!”  Might we see we see some of our kids exhaustion in this beleaguered first century man? \\nLegion, the demons in the story, bargain with Jesus in whiney voices; it’s almost comical: “oh please don’t send us to the abyss, as we will surely perish in its watery depths.  Send us into those harmless pigs over there, and we won’t bother this guy anymore.”  Jesus consents, only to have the herd of pigs panic and rush off a cliff and drown.  This throws the whole town into understandable upheaval.  Swineherds have lost their livelihood and now this man who has been ostracized and imprisoned as unclean, impure and dangerous is looking oddly normal.  They find him sitting at Jesus feet, a position common to students of a great teacher.  He is clothed.  He is “in his right mind.”  Do they celebrate that their neighbor has been restored to them?  No.  Everyone is so terrified at this sign of Jesus’ power and authority that they beg Jesus to leave.   The transformed man implores Jesus to let him join up as a follower, but oddly Jesus tells him to go home and “declare how much God has done for you.”  And the man does just that; he goes about “proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.”  \\nThis story reminds me that when God does things in our lives, it does not always make life easier or smoother.  In many ways, the man formerly possessed by demons had to return to a wary community who had paid a great cost (through lost livestock) for his healing. It would take a long time for people to understand and accept his transformation.  There is something truly disruptive about God’s power among us, which challenges social assumptions and unsettles social order.  Clothed in Christ we may start looking at the world from God’s perspective; we start describing what God has done for us to each other and suggesting controversial alternatives to the way life is.  These are the stories that our young people need to hear from us.  Each of us, not just one youth worker or Sunday School teacher.  If anything, the presenters said last week, know that youth ministry is the ministry of the WHOLE congregation!  The consumer culture will tell them that outer acquisition defines them: college admission and well-paying jobs, accumulation of cars and homes and travel experiences.  These things are not evil, but they are clearly not all there is to thriving and a well-lived life.   This quaint term, “clothed in Christ,” might be a starting point: we start consider and begin to share how we our mind has changed; how we came to a “right mind” like the man possessed; to share how God’s power is changing us.  We might explore together how these changes are opening us up to the needs of others in new ways, and how we are called to new actions of compassion and service. \\n\\tAs you and I face the inevitable challenges of the week ahead, we might try this as a spiritual practice:  inwardly say with Paul, “I am clothed in Christ.”   We might imagine ourselves sitting quietly at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in our right mind, healed and whole; ready to hear where he will send us.  We might notice what is beginning to quietly transform within us.  And so we practice.  We pay attention.  And we give thanks to God.  Amen',\n",
       " '\\tWhen was the last time any of us ventured into the Old Testament book of Leviticus?  Probably not recently, ever.  It seldom shows up in the Common Lectionary texts, the three-year cycle of scripture readings that we share with other Protestant and Catholic churches. This book from Jewish scriptures is the middle book in the ancient Torah, the five books of Jewish law.  If we are spending any time at all considering what we Christians call the Old Testament, we might more naturally be drawn to the poetic creation stories, all those those different colorful characters and suspenseful tales of the early Jewish community in Genesis.  Or to the book of Exodus with all that Hollywood drama about plagues, escape from captivity in Egypt, trials and tribulations of a long journey in the wilderness.   But Leviticus?  It’s a detailed, meticulous, tedious list of rules, to be blunt. First section: numberous details about the role of priests and the rituals for temple.  Little of this is observed in the Jewish community today because the ritual of temple sacrifice stopped in 70 AD with the final destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.  After this somewhat mind-numbing section, there are many verses about purity and uncleanliness.  And some of it is really strange to our modern sensibilities:  food laws about what is clean and unclean, purification rituals after childbirth and disease.  Then comes the section from which our text is taken today: the Holiness code.  Included are all sorts of teachings about practical, everyday holiness that sound really strange to us: don’t sacrifice your child to Molech.  And don’t have sex with animals. What is a contemporary Christian, or Jew for that matter, to do with all this?  Why might the compilers of the Christian Common Lectionary includes this passage to go along with today’s New Testament piece from Jesus’ sermon on the mount ?  I think there is something in both these passages that is less about individual piety and morality.  It’s about about our everyday living in community that is both provocative and encouraging.  But it doesn’t seem so at first glance.\\n\\tIn an effort to take scripture seriously, even as we do not take it literally, let’s consider this Leviticus portion:  It’s purportedly coming from the mouth of the great Jewish leader Moses, who brought them out of Egypt and through the wilderness wanderings to the promised land.  But it is most likely complied much later, after the return from Exile in Babylon and the re-building of the destroyed Temple – mid 6th century BCE.  It’s to be viewed “in the tradition” of this great leader. “You shall be holy,” Moses quotes God as proclaiming,  “for I the Lord your God am holy.”  We can be easily thrown off by this call to be “holy.”  Perhaps we might avoid this challenge to be a model of holy perfection by simply turning to the words of an easy-going Jesus, but watch out.  Apparently, Jesus was well-versed in this Leviticus passage, because here he is saying much the same darn thing in his sermon on the mount: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”\\n\\tBe holy.  Be perfect.  Well, that’s impossible.  And who wants to come to church to be shamed about their imperfections and mistakes and fallibilities?  Not me, and I don’t suppose you do either.  Shall we just go home now, back to our clearly unholy and imperfect lives?  Who wants to be considered “holier than thou” anyway.   Funny how sometimes this holiness business gets projected onto ministers.  I had a friend once who loved catching me in “unholy” or “imperfect” seeming behavior, especially if I voiced a particularly racey opinion about something or let fly with an occasional curse word.  “REVEREND!!!!”  He would exclaim in a seemingly shocked tone.   It was almost as if I was supposed to be holy for everyone else.  \\n\\tAs we look to forming a pastoral search committee to find a new called minister for this church community, it may be worth thinking about your own, and the congregations, expectations of a minister.  I have been reflecting on the promises I made in my ordination to Christian ministry service, which was 35 years ago this week.  I promised to be diligent in my private prayers and in reading the scriptures, as well as the public duties of my office; I promised to regard all people with equal love and concern, ministering impartially to the needs of all.   It was years later that I read the words of Anthony B. Robinson, UCC minister and author, who described how ministers are asked not to be holy for the congregation.  We are not the FT Christians with our church members being the part-time Christians.  Robinson writes that our job as ministers is to be holy with you, equipping and empowering you to do your ministries in the world of the everyday (What’s Theology Got to do with it, p. 187); to be holy with you.  \\n\\tThis holiness of which the Book of Leviticus speaks is less about uptight moral correctness. It’s more about us being transformed as people, and community, as we practice imitating the character of God within community.  This is less specific; more like “nailing Jello to the wall.”  The word holy in Hebrew actually means “separate.”  There is always this sense of God’s distinct difference form humans, AND Israel’s call to be separate from the other nations.  They were to be a light to the nations, an example of God’s loving and merciful character.  “Be holy, for I am holy,” says God.   Not holier-than-thous, but as in “You are made in my image.  Live it!”  What might this look like?  Levitius gave some direction for people in those times.  Unlike other nations, you are to leave some of your crops unpicked out on the edges of the field for the poor and the alien.  I wonder what that might look like for us today, to leave some of our extra bounty out for others.  Unlike other communities, you are to pay your workers before they go home at night; don’t give the deaf and the blind a hard time.  These admonitions are about how a whole society lives justly and in harmony with one another; how they govern themselves, how they care for the marginalized – the work of the polis, or dare we say in church: politics!  What might holiness look like in the public square?  What role might an inclusive, diverse, open faith community like Emmaus play in that public holiness?\\n\\tAs I read through my ordination vows this last week, I was also struck by this particular question:  Will you be zealous in maintaining both the truth of the gospel and the peace of the church, speaking the truth in love?   I realized what a difficult task this often is, to let the truth of the gospel challenge us to action and also somehow keep the peace in a church….especially where everyone has different ideas about what both the “truth of the gospel” and the actions should might be.   I thought of how tempting it is in congregations, especially where there has been conflict over certain social justice issues, to lean more into maintaining a peace but not dealing with the truth of the gospel…mostly by just not talking about difficult issues anymore.  To think that our feeding the poor by collecting food and money for packaging emergency meals lets us off the hook from exploring the reasons behind world hunger, income disparity and homelessness, particularly in this country.  We worry that if we talk about public policies and practices, we will offend someone.  Especially in a church where the peace has been repeatedly broken and heated arguments and personal attacks have prevailed, and people have left….isn’t it best just to send food or money and not try to talk about these political-seeming issues?  In our reticence, I believe we miss a chance to know and love our neighbors more deeply.  We not only miss the chance to advocate for changes that might bring about greater food and income justice in our society. We miss the chance to change the tone of the rhetoric in our communities, to build empathy and understanding across differences.  \\n\\tWhen Jesus taught, “love your neighbor as yourself,” he wasn’t teaching something new.  But he is putting our everyday living in a radically new context.  “You have heard it was said….”  and then he describes a different kind of strategy for dealing with the mistakes, the fallibilities, the rampant imperfections of other people.  Here you go, he says:  be perfect as God is perfect.  The word perfect is telos in Greek, which refers to something’s purpose or goal.  Perfection may be less about moral fastidiousness, and simply about becoming what we are intended to be as God’s creatures.  This is life in the Kingdom of God, in this realm of hope and justice that is breaking into the world through me, he claimed.  “Be perfect – be who you are created to be!”  is perhaps a better way to describe what Jesus is saying.  And his directives about what this might look like may seem impractical and naïve, even dangerous in our modern world.  But I hear him questioning the rules of this world.  Be holy, be separate, be different from the rules that run the rest of the world:  The rules that say be strong, don’t be vulnerable; you must convince others with your forceful arguments, you must be right.   Jesus won’t play by these rules.   He understood that concentrated, passive resistance to power can have a deeply undermining effect.  That sustained, respectful sharing of different opinions, in an atmosphere of curiosity and openness, can do much to soften people’s hearts, and change the nature of our public discourse.   \\n\\tIt sounds counter-intuitive what Jesus is describing. This is how you are to live, everyday, as part of God’s realm, he says:  Be a separate example of what true loving community looks like.  How often we read Jesus word’s and think he wants us to be wimps.  Far from it.  We are called to be an alternative community, where hopefulness and compassion rule.  Where holiness and perfection is a joy.  Because this is who we are created to be.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.  ',\n",
       " 'Saying goodbye….on the eve of an impending hurricane!   As if saying farewell after two years together as interim pastor and congregation wasn’t unsettling enough, and the new settled pastor hasn’t even been chosen yet…..now we have all the uncertainty and potential damage and danger, inconvenience, expense, of a huge wind and rain storm!   We channel our anxiety into a flurry of necessary preparations, which is certainly prudent.  But a part of us may just want to hold our breath and screw our eyes shut until this is over.  Gracious.  \\nThe question for the Church, in times like this, is not “where is God” or “why is this happening to us?”   God is right here, surrounding and within each of us and all of us together, as always.   And if we want answers to the “why” we best go to the weather channel and consult the meterologists for the latest on this “perfect storm.” (I hear Jim Cantori has already checked into the Cambridge Hyatt, which is never a good sign!)  But I do not believe that God “sends” storms upon us or make beloved pastors leave, to punish or even to teach us lessons.   Being subject to chaotic weather is part of what it means to live on a planet that is still being created, still evolving.  You and I agree to being part of the weather simply by being human and living on the Earth!  Having an interim pastor leave is part of an agreement that we made when I first arrived over two years ago.  The members of this church and I agreed that we wouldn’t be wooing each other during this interim time, in hopes of a future permanent match.  We would do ministry together and be honest with one another about the state of this congregation and what we sensed God was calling you all to next, learning about what kind of new leadership you would need to take you into that envisioned future.  \\nSo, if we affirm God is in the midst of all that is happening this morning and we aren’t going to dwell on “why is God doing this to me?” then where do we turn?  Where do we find hope and encouragement?  I suggest we ask ourselves:  What might God be saying to us, revealing to us, in the middle of all this unsettling turmoil?  I suppose we can either get really sad about endings like my leaving or uptight and anxious about unknowns like hurricanes barreling down on top of us.  OR .….we can get curious and consider our circumstances in the light of today’s Biblical text, from the perspective of our faith in God’s goodness and constancy.   I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears, says the Psalm portion we just read.  That’s what we do in worship, we seek the Lord together, through singing, praying and considering our sacred texts from the Bible.   Let’s turn to this reading from the Gospel of Mark and see what is there for us….because apparently our hope is in just that….in a spiritual eyesight that is able to see, envision, what God is up to…\\n\\tOur text from the Gospel of Mark draws us deeper into this vision metaphor:  what do we see right now; what can we not see yet, what are we reluctant to really see in our church, our families, the world around us?  As this story begins, Jesus and his disciples are on the way to Jerusalem, passing through the town of Jericho. Suddenly, a man sitting by the side of the road calls out to Jesus.  The man is said to be blind and he is a beggar.  Bottom of the pile economically, with no means taking care of himself other than asking for hand-outs.  But unlike many of the healing stories, he has a name and a lineage:  Bartimaeus, son of Timaus.  What future does he “see” for himself, we might wonder.  Where does he get his gumption, is what I want to know.  “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” now he is shouting.  Many people in Jesus’ group, and those who have gathered along the road, sternly rebuke the man.  “Pipe down already, you are making a scene.”  “Son of David,” bellows the man, “have mercy on me!”  “Son of David” is a Messianic title in Judaism;  Bartimaeus was linking Jesus to a long lineage, going back to Israel’s most famous King during the height of its prestige and power of the united monarchy in the 900’s before Christ.   The man without economic means, status or sight, “sees” something in Jesus that even his disciples have been missing: this is the Messiah, this is the one ushering in God’s reign of justice and compassion.  \\nIn the midst of difficult times, God wants our spiritual sight to be healed.  What a challenge:  to perceive and really hold on to God’s promises, to let these be a bedrock in our lives, and to move forward at the same time.  The novelist and theologian, Frederick Buechner describes this visualizing of God’s presence and promises in his book, Secrets in the Dark.  \\xa0\"By faith,” Buechner writes, “we understand, if we are to understand it at all, that the madness and lostness we see all around us and within us are not the last truth about the world but only the next to the last truth….Faith is the eye of the heart, and by faith we see deep down beneath the face of things – by faith we struggle against all odds to be able to see – that the world is God\\'s creation even so.\\xa0 It is (God) who made us and not we ourselves, made us out of God’s peace to live in peace, out of God’s light to dwell in light, out of God’s love to be above all things loved and loving.\\xa0That is the last truth about the world.\"  “Your faith has made you well, whole, renewed,” Jesus says to the Bartimeus.  The eyes of Bartimeus’ heart saw and recognized Jesus as the one ushering in God’s kingdom of justice and mercy.  The eyes of his heart knew that the “madness and lostness” all around him were not the last truth about the world.\\xa0\\nWe are in the middle of circumstances this weekend and in the next few days over which we do not have a lot of control.  We can buy bottled water, batteries and sandbags and pull boats out of the water, and the forces of nature will move as they will.   But whatever happens, these things will not be the “last truth.”  In the middle of all this, the Psalmist suggests we Look to God and be radiant.  Wow…our faces do get ashen when we are sad or worried.  Look to God and be radiant….what a powerful phrase to carry with us through the upcoming days.  We are made “out of God’s light to dwell in light,” wrote Buechener.   Be a light filled vision to those around you, helping them envision a future where God is working in all things for good.   Because we don’t know what the storm will bring, and we don’t know what your time with your future pastor will be like.   But we do know that our fears can bring on a certain spiritual blindness.  “What do you want from me,”  Jesus asks blind Bartimeus.  “Teacher, let me see again,” he says.  We too need to ask God over and over, “let me see again.”\\nFor two years we have been thinking, praying and discussing together about your unseen future, what God might be calling you to do as a congregation.   Like our Protestant ancestors during the Reformation, we have sought to be bold in maintaining the best of the past but always re-forming ourselves in light of  God’s emerging future.\\nAnd now, other pastors will work with you in that task.  First Pastor Rob for a spell, as the Pastoral Search Committee finishes it’s work and presents you with a candidate for the settled position.  Then, this yet unseen Pastor will come to help you discover your own gifts and talents, help equip you for different types of ministries here in this beautiful church and out into the wider community.  A blind man was able to “see” Jesus for who he was.  The Protestant Reformers called people to see the possibilities of God’s re-vitalizing and re-forming movement among them, in the middle of institutional corruption and individual disempowerment.   We too each move into God’s uncertain but good future. With radiant faces we hold onto this vision that “It is (God) who made us and not we ourselves, made us out of God’s light to dwell in light,… out of God’s love to be above all things loved and loving.\\xa0That is the last truth about the world.\"\\xa0 I will always treasure these brief two years together, this time when you faithfully, courageously have envisioned:  “What is God calling us to next?”  Let us each continue to look to God and be radiant, now and in the days to come.   Amen.\\n\\t \\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThe Gospel writer John often used nighttime settings as he described Jesus’ own struggle with his mission, and also people’s perplexed reactions to Jesus.  In John’s Gospel, darkness becomes a symbol of confusion, unbelief, and temptation.  And also of choices and possibility.  I think of the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus speaks urgently to God right before his arrest, while his disciples doze-off.   The predawn darkness in which the empty tomb is discovered.  Contrasting images of light and darkness, John will unfold the compelling metaphor of Jesus the “Light of the world” that “shines in the darkness.”  \\n\\n\\tToday, we hear a story of a man who journeys out into the darkness of night, wending his way through the labyrinth of unlit streets that was first century Jerusalem.   Jesus and his disciples had arrived in the Holy City for the Jewish Passover celebrations at the great Temple.  Still ahead of them are the confusing and frightening events of Jesus’ final confrontation with the religious and political authorities.  But this night, all is quiet.\\n\\n\\tThe Pharisee Nicodemus of this nighttime encounter was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders.  Clearly a respected and important community leader.  But one might wonder, why was he sneaking around in the dark?  Was he worried what his Jerusalem colleagues would think if he talked with Jesus?  Many of the Pharisees were increasingly concerned that Jesus’ teachings and rabble rousing would bring down the wrath of the Romans on the whole Jewish community.  But there was also an ancient tradition that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the complexities and marvel of the text.  Some Biblical commentators suggest that Nicodemus was a true seeker, had been paying attention to Jesus teaching and healing work, and now came to “study” him, in the still of the night (Patricia Farris, Christian Century, Jan. 30-Feb. 6, 2002).\\n\\n\\tNicodemus begins by respectfully addressing Jesus as “rabbi,” meaning revered teacher.   We hear the caution in his words; he politely acknowledges Jesus is from God, (not divine, from God) because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  Jesus seems to ignore Nicodemus’ respectful opening words, and makes this curt and unexpected pronouncement:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  “Excuse me? What?” Nicodemus may well have responded.  \\n\\n\\tAnd this is where the warning lights start to flash for many of us in the 21st century and we mentally screech to a halt.  This language of being born again, and also the following verse about believing so you can have eternal life, has been incredibly divisive in the Christian church.  And it has made for a lot of stereotypes and bad press about purportedly exclusive Christian claims.  I am talking about the assumption that you are either in or you are out, depending on what you believe.  This has had disastrous historical consequences, of course, as anyone considered out has, at various times in church history, been shamed, excluded, persecuted and/or killed.  \\n\\n\\tBut notice that Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God, like it is a locality, or, as many assume, a place we might arrive when we die.  He talks about “seeing,” or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, reign of justice and compassion among us.  Jesus speaks as if it is already here, all around and even within us.  Our problem seems to be with a deeper perception of the eyes of the heart.  “No one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew” says Jesus.  Other translations read “born from above.”  The word anaothen for “born” has double meaning in Greek:  anaothen means both “from above” and it means “again or anew.”  Unfortunately, most Bible translators, moving from Greek to English, chose one meaning or the other and we lose this intentionally ambiguous reply of Jesus.  It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  Great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us! \\n\\nBut is Jesus asking for a type of “blind faith?”  I don’t think so.  For Jesus, “The Kingdom of God” covers a lot of ground:  it is an environment (of justice, peace and healing) and a time (bursting into this present moment).  Clearly, new birth is going to enable a new kind of relating to God’s reality among us; this is where Jesus is going.   But another way to comprehend this is to play with the idea of consciousness, our intuitive awareness that goes beyond our 5 senses.  Perhaps the Kingdom of God is a place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Was Jesus talking about a different state of consciousness? This is where the contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault goes in her book some of us have bee reading during Lent: Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind. ( p. 30.)  It’s as though Jesus is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension.  This can sound a tad new-agey, or “theology lite,” for some of us, but is worth exploring.\\n\\nBourgeault suggests that the Kingdom of God is actually a “whole new way of looking at the world.  A transformed awareness that literally turns the world into a different place….a world that doesn’t make separations between God and humans, between humans and humans, between humans and creation…”  She calls it a “ world of mutual abiding” where God dwells in us and we dwell in God.”  A complete mutual indwelling of different entities, an indwelling that already is that we begin to experience through spiritual practices of prayer and meditation.  Practices that begin to change our consciousness so we begin to see our neighbor’s being as a continuation of our own.  We start to see our neighbor’s well being as a continuation of our own well being.  I think Bourgeault is on to some of the more revolutionary aspects of Jesus’ teachings.  Come join us on Thursday nights if you want to dig deeper!\\n\\n Nicodemus can’t see or imagine himself being born again or anew or from above. That process looks too unknown, too problematic, too risky. He gets stuck in a literal interpretation:  “how in the world can you go back into your mother’s womb?” The man just can’t grasp that Jesus is talking about a transformative experience of the living God through knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to the Jesus in front of him.  \\n\\t\\n\\t“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have everlasting life,” Jesus continues.  What was he really saying here?  “You have to get your thinking straightened out?  Your theological concepts need to be correct?”  But in story after story of encounters with Jesus, people are not grilled about their theological beliefs about him before he will talk with them, heal them, help them.   The Greek word for \"belief\" used here is less about an intellectual concept and more about an action. \\xa0The Greek work\\xa0credo,\\xa0\"I believe,\" is more accurately translated as \"I give my heart to\" or \"I trust in.\" \\xa0What is Jesus asking Nicodemus to give his heart to, to trust in? \\xa0The key here seems to be what is meant by “eternal life.”  All too often we immediately think of some heavenly, blissful existence where we live forever after we die.  But “eternal life” is always connected to Jesus’ promise that he has come to bring “life, and life abundantly.”  It’s all about a deeper living, a fuller connection with God in this moment, a wider sense of relationship with and responsibility for other humans.\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what happened to Nicodemus as he left Jesus that night.  As Nicodemus walked back to his home through the quiet city streets, perhaps he recalled the steady, glowing brightness of Jesus’ presence, his intensity of being.  Something must have started to work in Nicodemus that night, something began to “re-wire” inside of him and he perceived something anew.  Because later, when the chief priests and Pharisees want to have Jesus arrested, Nicodemus will insist that Jesus have a hearing before them first.   And perhaps most significant, it will be Nicodemus who joins Joseph of Arimathea to remove Jesus body from the cross after he is executed.   As the crowds disperse on that sad and awful late Good Friday afternoon, Nicodemus will bring pounds of spices with which to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.\\n\\t\\n\\tWe don’t just want theological information; we yearn for a way in, to be reborn and made new, again and again.  The spirit of the Living Jesus provides both context and illumination for this way into God.  Jesus waits for us in the quiet shadows of our hearts, ready to listen and to guide us.  May we meet him there.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBefore I attended seminary in my early twenties, I had little idea of what Lent was really about.  I wasn’t sure about why I, as a Protestant, should care one way or the other.   At that point in my life, Lent was a strange, gloomy season before Easter celebrated by Catholics.  I remember childhood friends unexpectedly showing up at school with ashy smudges on their foreheads.  And how they would speak in hushed tones about going to confession and what they were “giving up” for Lent.  Over at my house, all eyes were happily on the arrival of spring and Easter!  My sister and I eagerly anticipated new dresses for church, savoring chocolate rabbits and hunting for cheery, colored eggs.  But my perspective changed early in my ministry; maybe it was from hanging out with those southern, bourbon-drinking Episcopalians in seminary.  They were big on the seasons of the church liturgical year.  I began to appreciate the reflective and penitential “purple times” of Advent and Lent.  Of the value of a time-set-apart, of the power of silence and contemplative prayer, of my own need for self-reflection.  In Lenten practices of receiving ashes, self-reflection, consistent prayer, scripture study, I began to recognize my deeper hunger to experience God.  It was no longer enough for me to simply think about God.   \\nThrough the years of my ministry, I have grown aware of how contrary these somber, quiet seasons of Advent and Lent are to our frenzied, constantly upbeat American mainstream.   Even as a church community, we feel that pressure to be continually relevant; to have influence, voice, power in the public square.  We want to seem daring and even spectacular in our ministries.  Gracious, it can be exhausting!  I have come to appreciate the pause that these seasons of preparation offer us, and the spiritual formation they make possible.  As the church, we step back in these Advent and Lent times, and contemplate the meaning of the “big events”, the mysteries of Jesus’ birth and death.  This is in part why I am offering a time to explore different ways of praying on Tuesday nights through Lent.  And why I am inviting us to immerse ourselves in the upcoming lectionary texts on Sunday mornings with a Wednesday morning Bible study.  How are we each experiencing God; how do we come to understand who Jesus was and is, through prayer and soaking in the Biblical message?  Good Lenten questions, as we prepare to face what I consider to be the most profound mystery of the Christian story:  the arrest, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. \\n\\tBut we are not there yet.  Our reading on this First Sunday in Lent from Luke’s Gospel offers a the starter-story to Jesus public ministry.  And it is a rather strange tale.  It is filled with words that may grate against our modern sensibilities: Devil, tests and temptation.  Our mind might conjure up visions of demonic figures from the middle Ages, complete with horns, red-face and a forked tail.  Did this encounter really happen?  Did Jesus actually meet and converse with someone, or was this all happening in his head?  According to Luke, as Jesus came up out of the River Jordan at his baptism, water streaming down his face, he heard God say, “this is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.” We are not told if he is surprised by this curious news or it confirms something he already knows about himself.  What we do know is that event propells him to disappear into the desert.  A scruffy isolated wilderness area, dry, hot; the dusty ground strewn with rocks.  \\n\\tWe can well imagine Jesus might need some kind of personal time after hearing those words: “This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.” Now what did THAT mean?    Filled with the Spirit, he spends “Forty days and forty nights” alone fasting in the wilderness.  Luke’s first century readers would recall Moses’ 40 days of fasting on Mt. Sinai as he talks with God, the Jews 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, hungry and often confused, searching for the promised land as they become God’s called people.  Here, Jesus too is exhausted and famished…. and then the one called “the tempter,” “the devil,” or the “evil one” appears.   Jesus encounters some entity, which is actually better translated as “the adversary.” This being taunts him with what seem to be various temptations.\\n\\tNot your run-of-the-mill temptations:  have another piece of cake; don’t mention the cashier over-paid you.  Whoever this “devil” figure is, he/she/it is actually pushing Jesus to face the implications of the baptismal voice.  “If you are the Son of God,” how about this, taunts the adversary?  What’s your vocation about, Jesus? What kind of Son of God are you, really?  And the first test is pretty tempting, and I don’t think it’s just because Jesus is weak with hunger at this point at this point. The tests are tempting because they contain partial truths:  Come on Jesus, I know you are going to be concerned about those in need!  Let’s get started here, by turning these stones into bread! There’s the partial truth.  Don’t you want to seem relevant and popular in this world where so many are hungry?  There is the insidious invitation to be someone he is not.  God is not a vending machine, replies Jesus.  My ministry is not just about physical bread or satisfying the public; it’s about feeding body and soul.\\n\\tThe adversary regroups: Hey Jesus, God’s reign of justice and peace is a real challenge to earthly corrupt powers.  (There is truth in this.)  Don’t you want to have influence over the kingdoms of the earth so you can get this Kingdom of God thing started in the right way?!   (Of course he does!) Just give me some credit here and worship me, says the adversary.  I am about worshipping and serving God.  Period.\\n\\tFinally, the adversary turns to the Book of Psalms:  God’s protection is promised to the righteous ones who call on God’s name!  In an ironic twist, the adversary suggests Jesus try this out in the center of Israel’s holy city Jerusalem and sacred Temple.   I can just hear the sly sneer: So Jesus, you certainly are righteous; how about you just fling yourself off this Temple balcony?  Make a spectacle of it!  Go ahead, lean into those promises of the ever gracious and saving God!   I am not about putting God to the test.  \\nIt’s one thing to say no to something that we know is really wrong. Saying “no” to speeding at 90 miles an hour, or physically assaulting the dithering person in line at the grocery store, or cheating on a spouse at least has some “right and wrong” clarity.   But what about the places in our lives that seem less clear?  How about the day-to-day ethical choices that are awash with grey and ambiguity: a simple statement that borders on a tiny lie, a misrepresentation about ourselves or someone else.  Flying around the Beltway at….hmmmm….70 miles an hour or shaving 20 pounds off our current weight when we renew our driver’s license?  Saying we think or feel something when we really don’t?   Leaving parts out of a certain story when we talk with our wondering spouse; refraining from telling a friend how we really feel about a recent interaction?   Thinking that problem solving is only up to our intellect and ignoring the slow, patient discernment of God’s will? There are plenty of small, grey-area part-truths that ask for our allegiance.  The real temptation in all this is to be someone we are not.  To be less than the beloved son or daughter of God who is called to speak the truth in love, to act with compassion, to trust in God’s guidance. \\nThe question before us during Lent is always:  who is this Jesus?  What kind of Son of God is this?  And we also ask ourselves:  who am I?  What kind of child of God am I called to be?  Jesus is the one who will not live with half-truth; he will not use God as a magic trick waiting to fulfill his desire to be relevant or powerful or spectacular.  By choosing to live out the full truth of who he is, Jesus will face enormous consequences.  His teaching and healing will invite many into God’s saving grace, and it will also begin to incur the wrath of public authorities.  On this first Sunday in Lent, we might well wonder to ourselves:  what would it mean for me to more fully live into God’s will for me, as God’s beloved child? The weeks of Lent are an invitation to explore these questions.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " 'a transformation of both nature and human affairs could ever be possible.\\n\\n\\t“A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.”  This is how Isaiah begins this vision of a new age.  Picture a tree stump in your mind’s eye.  Stumps usually look pretty inert, basically dead.  The upper part of the tree has been sawed off, or maybe burnt and split by lighting.  A pain in the neck to remove.  Good for sitting on, if nothing else.  What’s going to grow out of this?  One of my seminary classmates blogged recently on this Isaiah passage, saying that this passage reminder her of “the stump of utter despair.”  Barbara Lundblad, now professor at Union Seminary in New York City, writes, “who can imagine anything growing as they sit on the stump of utter despair? “I’ve sat there myself,” she says, “perhaps you have too.”   \\n\\n\\tIn the time Isaiah writes, 7th century BCE, it looks like the nation of Israel will never rise again after repeated foreign invasion and corrupt internal leadership.  The “stump of Jesse” here refers to the beloved King David’s father; but all around them, the royal house of David is falling.   The nation sits collectively on the stump in despair.   Barbara Lundblad suggests that Isaiah boldly offers the vision of a shoot coming forth that will be different from what people expected.  Of a type of leadership that was to come that will bring a spirit of wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and might, a spirit of knowledge and the awesomeness of God.  Is it any wonder that the early followers of Jesus came to associate this leadership way described in the Hebrew scriptures with their teacher and Lord?\\n\\n\\tAs I heard about the death of Nelson Mandela this last week, I thought about the swirl of despair that threatened to engulf much of his life.  Imprisoned for so many years, fighting against the unjust system of apartheid, struggling with black leaders who cried for revenge and white leaders who angrily watched their world crumble.  His push for the long, slow, meticulous “truth and reconciliation” hearings seeking, with some measure of success, to uncover the truth from all sides about human rights abuses, restore victims dignity, assist with rehabilitation and, where appropriate, granting amnesty. Practicing peace at one of its most difficult levels: at the place where two people have to look each other in the eyes and tell and hear their stories.\\n\\n\\tWhat makes for peace in a world such as ours?  Through my pastoral counseling training and working with conflicted couples, I learned that you could predict the potential longevity of a marriage by how people fight with one another.  Not, if they fight or don’t fight.  Researches in this field have figured out what is obvious to those in healthy relationships:  it is both the level of honesty in communication, combined with the level of vulnerability that we are able to reveal to the other, that is the primary factor in conflict resolution that deepens connection between two people, and I would say, within communities.\\n\\n\\tHonesty and vulnerability as the core to peace-making, as a way of getting off that “stump” of despair when we feel immobilized.  The practice of peace being a daily recommitment to being honest and vulnerable, first with ourselves, and then with the other.  Sounds risky, even dangerous.  Where do we get the vision, courage, and the gumption for such a practice?   I suggest that it is our Matthew text, which gives us clues to engaging in the practice of peace.  And these clues are going to come from what really is the gruffest, harshest sounding character in our Advent texts: John the Baptist.  John the Baptist, the adult. will eventually usher Jesus into his public ministry through Jesus’ baptism in the river Jordan.  Their mother’s were cousins, according to the ancient tale.  When newly pregnant Mary travels to visit hugely pregnant Elizabeth, the in-uterio John leaps at Jesus’ in-uterio presence.   John grows up to become a spiritual teacher, possible zealot seeking to overthrow Roman rule, but certainly prophetic voice about God’s coming reign of justice and mercy.   Think desert monasticism to the extreme, complete with dusty sandals, dark tattered robe and maybe even dreadlocks. The older cousin who was apparently a spiritual mentor for Jesus. \\n\\nJohn was possibly part of the aesthetic, self-denying Essene movement that had given up on what they saw to be corrupt worship practices and pandering to the Roman occupiers by the Jewish priests in the Jerusalem temple.  John the Baptist sets up camp on the outside of the city, in the wilderness of Judea, and begins preaching prophetically about the age to come:  “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near….prepare the way of the Lord!”  He foretells of a leveling out/making straight process where those on the margins will be drawn into God’s kingdom of extravagant welcome and generosity. \\nHe preaches a message of repentance for the forgiveness of sins and baptism as a ritual sign of that reorientation, that change in perspective that repentance can bring.  That change in life direction that such self-honesty and open vulnerability can make possible. City people from Jerusalem flocked to him, drawn away from the complicated temple rituals repentance, compelled by the raw simplicity of committing themselves to self-reflection, accountability and living their lives differently.\\n\\nThese are the Advent voices offered to us this morning.  An unlikely call to a wider vision of peace, involving dangerous animals and little children hanging out in mutual vulnerability.  An unsettling call to preparing ourselves, our inner life, by self-honesty and accountability to both God and one another.  This is the reflective brooding Advent world; perhaps understood best in bare winter woods, surrounded by silent and frigid air, light snowfall.  The Biblical truth is that Advent is both a somber and joy filled time, and I thank God for that.  Amidst the glitter-spin and frenetic pace of the holiday season, here is this call to reflection, self-honesty, and repentance.  Not to shame us, not to punish us, but simply to re-orient us.  The call to repentance is an invitation into the personal transformation God envisions for each us.  And so renewed by our honesty, we are paradoxically empowered by our vulnerability.  In our private and public places, we practice and the ways of peace in a distracted and violent world.   We claim Isaiah’s vision of new green shoots growing up out of barren stumps:  “They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.”  And so may it be.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '. I have often thought of the Sunday after Easter as the big “Now What?” in the Christian Church.  The trumpet fanfare of Easter is over and the lilies have disappeared.  Jesus has risen from the dead, we boldly proclaim!  Yet, as I look around, humanity does not appear very resurrected.  It has been a difficult week on national scene, as we watched in disbelief as tornados tore through the South, communities and lives destroyed.  Easter has passed and we are still engaged in three wars in different parts of the world.  People among us still struggle with illness and unemployment and silent burdens. \\n\\nSo, the “now what” after Easter finds us in a sobering context on this beautiful spring day.  We are reminded of this essential paradox of the Easter message:  Christ has risen and the world continues to struggle with evil and human violence.  Keeping in mind the provocative question of “now what” or even “so what, Christ is risen…” we turn to see what God might say to us in today’s scripture readings.   \\n\\n\\n\\tAt this point in the Easter story, the followers of Jesus have basically gone into hiding.  In the Gospel of John reading, we hear that is the “evening on that day,” meaning the night after the day Mary Magdalene and several male disciples found the empty tomb.   Jesus has been executed as a troublesome teacher and prophet who threatened the well-being of the whole Jewish community.  The Jewish leaders of the time maintained a fragile peace with the occupying Roman legions.  Deciding that Jesus needed to be stopped for the good of the whole, the religious leaders dragged him before the Roman executioners.  Now, Jesus’ disciples are terrified that the authorities will come after them too, as them have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.  And there is this strange news from the women followers that the tomb is empty.  Mary says she has actually seen Jesus.  What. Is. Going. On….?\\nThat evening, in the midst of a hasty evening meal and anxious, conversation, Jesus is standing in the middle of the room!   “Peace be with you,” he announces.  It is hard for us to imagine what this would have been like, all of a sudden seeing your dead teacher and leader standing before you, showing you his wounded hands and side.  Shock, bewilderment, joy….the disciples must have felt a wild mix of emotions.    Perhaps seeing the confusion and fear on their faces, Jesus says to them again: “peace be with you, as God has sent me, so I send you.”   Most of them have denied him, they have run away.  And there he is greeting them openly, lovingly, forgivingly.  That Jesus greets them without judgement, without accusation or even disappointment, may be the true miracle of Easter.  This is the “so what” that fascinates me in the resurrection accounts.\\n\\tAs I read Jesus’ words of greeting, “peace be with you,” I am reminded of how we “pass the peace of Christ” each Sunday at the conclusion of our worship service.   It’s easy to lapse into a “hi, how are you?’” kind of salutation during this time, and end up chatting about church business or after-worship plans.   What might we be extending to one another if we were to look each other directly in the eye and say these words: “peace be with you.”   This is no casual thing, I believe.  This is not just “being friendly.”  These are the words of our Lord.  This simple practice is extending the “peace of Christ” to someone else.  \\nOf course, other words might naturally follow.  I don’t mean to suggest we should  greet each other on Sundays with only these four words.  But, I am suggesting that we bring an expanded awareness in our moment of “Passing the Peace.”   I am inviting us to say those words and to ask ourselves:  what am I imagining, what am I hoping for, when I extend the peace of the Risen Lord, the peace of God, to another person?  \\n\\tWe don’t really know, on any given Sunday, what a person brings with them to worship.  We don’t really know the full extent of the worries or fears, the sadness or anxiety, the memories or resentments, that lie on the hearts of our fellow worshippers, do we?  Each of us, at one time or another, comes to worship “locked” in something, just like the disciples were locked behind closed doors.    A newcomer may be in our midst, here for reasons we don’t really know or may not understand.   A longtime member could be sitting next to you filled with all kinds of unpeaceful feelings or thoughts.   I dare say that most of us come to worship on Sunday morning because we are hoping that God’s peace will enter us in a new way when we gather together.  We are not here to just be entertained; there is plenty of religious entertainment on television and the internet.  Church attendance is no longer a way to gain social status in most communities in this country.  And there are easier and more comfortable ways to visit with your friends than to sit through an hour of worship in a pew.   And here is the strange irony: we come to worship both because we need something and we need to give something.\\n\\tWe participate in worship because we want a transformative experience of the living God; to know God’s power, to feel empowered to go back out into our world with new perspectives, new energy.  And we also come because the rest of the Body of Christ, which is Immanuel church, needs our presence.  This is how we are nurtured and grow as Jesus’ disciples.  Both receiving and giving.  Sometimes just hearing “peace be with you” , in the middle of our life’s problems, is enough to keep us going.   What a gracious and hopeful thing to say to one another as we join in worship:  “peace be with you.”  Simple words, and yes they are “just words.”   But as we share them with compassionate intent and full eye contact, with long-time friend, family or a total stranger, we deepen our mutual experience of God’s loving peace in our midst.  No matter who that person is, where that other person is on their faith journey.\\n\\tJesus repeats this phrase, “peace be with you,” and then says “as the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  God’s peace is not something we hold close just for ourselves.  The church is not a spiritual Seven 11 or WAWA, where we duck in for a loaf of inspiration and a quart of good feelings.  The Christian faith is not a private experience.  The gospel writer describes that “when Jesus had said this, he breathed on them and said to them ‘receive the Holy Spirit.’”  This is the gospel writer John’s understanding of Pentecost.  This is the commissioning of the disciples to go out in his name, to forgive people of their sins, to be peace to others.  They are not to keep the gift of the Holy Spirit, of God’s peace, to themselves. \\n\\tIf this is our job description as Christians, to go out and spread the peace of God among people, how do will do this in the 21st century?   The mission field “out there” among the unchurched has changed considerably.  Congregations assume that simply being “friendly” is enough to draw new people, that Sunday morning church school is still the only way to do Christian Education, that organ music naturally draws people under age 50 and that it’s best not to talk too much about money.   Surprisingly, the churches that are reaching out to welcome new people are learning that none of these statements are true any more.  They are learning that focusing on making disciples, not preserving a building, is what will grow a congregation.   \\n\\t.  If the Risen Christ sent his disciples out to pass on God’s peace and forgiveness, in what ways will God call Immanuel to do this in the future?  \\n\\t“Peace be with you,” said the risen Jesus.  How do we be peace to this community, to this new environment in which the church finds itself today?  That is the post-Easter challenge, as I see it.  That is the call and the invitation set out before us.  “Receive the Holy Spirit,” says Jesus.  “Move out in my name and share this peace.”  Amen.   ',\n",
       " '\\tAncient Jewish poetry about light comes down to us in the Book of Genesis, oral stories finally recorded in writing long before the prophets or Jesus’ time.  “In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.”  The language is similar to Creation stories from various traditions around the world.  It begins with images of a great darkness, an embryonic shadow place devoid of light.  “Then God said, let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.”  Over the centuries, new visionaries have described emerging pictures of Creation, ones “swimming in stories about fireballs and photons and light.”  Since the early 1980’s, I have been drawn to the writings of Matthew Fox, Catholic priest and author who was eventually silenced by the Vatican for his revolutionary views of the nature and purpose of Creation.  He claimed that the Biblical creation stories are about an “original blessing” and not, as some early Christian church fathers had decided, about “original curse of original sin.”  But it was his conversations with physicists that first fascinated me.  From his dialogue with these scientists, he described his vision of creation in his book One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths:  \\n\\tFifteen billion years ago, in a great flash, the universe flared forth into being.  In each drop of existence a primordial energy blazed with an intensity never to be equaled again…In the beginning the universe is a great shining that expands rapidly and then explodes into hundreds of billions of swirling dark clouds…\\nLater, a hundred billion galaxies light up with a splendor new to the universe.  The beginning of the universe is a smooth, intense flame.  A few billion years later the large-scale structure of the universe glows in great sheets of galaxies and in their intersections in long, spidery filaments of sparkling worlds.  \\n\\t “I am the light of the world….and you are the light of the world,” Jesus will go on to teach.   Scientists now tell us that all matter is actually slow-moving light; we exist at all because of the light.    Matthew Fox describes how “light drives all energy systems.  Plants eat light, you and I eat light, breathe light, drink light and transform light into energy.”  During the middle ages, Jewish mystics writing in the Kabbalah, described that human beings were created when sparks gathered together: “some sparks of light adhering (together) and some remaining hidden throughout the world, sparks of holiness (suffusing) and intermingling with everything in the world.”  Is it any wonder that Albert Einstein admitted in the early part of the last century that “all I want to do is study light.”\\n\\tAs I consider the light metaphors for the divine and for illumined understanding throughout the world religions, I am struck by this paradox of our lives as followers of Jesus.  If, as matter, you and I are already light, Jesus was actually calling us to be who we are!  Be the light!  But, in choosing to follow the Jesus way, among all the religious choices in the world, we are somehow called to two things: “to both share the light that we can see and feel; and we are also to share the light that we can only imagine.”  Maybe that is part of our job as a church in the 21st century.  Could we be called to share a light, shine out a perspective, a way of being together, that we cannot yet even imagine?  \\n\\tThe more I think about where we are as a congregation in this transition time, in this time between decline and renewal, I realized that it’s doing this prayerful imagining together that is the starting point for the change we seek.  The starting point is not new programs, it’s not being an open and affirming congregation or a Just Peace church, it’s not refurbished rooms, it’s not about new study groups or even new outreach projects, it’s not some surprise donor giving a huge gift, it’s not even hiring a wonderful new pastor.  All these, of course, matter….but they are not where you start if you want to renew the ministries of a congregation.  The starting point is within you.  It’s within each of us, as we seek to be more truly who we are, the light to the world.   The starting point for the renewal of the ministries of this church is in each of us as we seek to follow the Word of God as outlined in the scriptures, and as we seek to follow the Living Word of God in the person of Jesus.   As we pledge to support a future church reality that we can not yet fully imagine.  At the start, it’s not about church growth, or returning to the church you once were. It’s about the deepening of your relationship with the Light that is Jesus.  Experiencing the light of God’s transformative love and sharing it with others. \\n\\tIn everything we do in the life of our congregation, we have to ask ourselves this question:  will others see the light of God’s love and compassion in us?  In this way, will they see Jesus?  Will people see the light of Jesus in the way we shine a light on places of darkness and suffering in this community and world around us?  The medieval Jewish mystics spoke of “raising the sparks of the potent energy of the divine.”  What will get “sparked” around here, in the months and years ahead?\\n\\tJesus invites us to follow him into the unknown places of our lives, illumined by the light of his teachings and continued presence.  He promises that we will be changed, “sparked;” we will be transformed and better able to draw others to experience his power and love. “You are the light of the world,” says Jesus.   Be the light.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tA man died and was standing in line up at the Pearly Gates.  When St. Peter finally got to him, the man was getting nervous about being allowed to enter Heaven.  St. Peter started quizzing him:  “Hmmmm…it is commonly assumed that up here we have a point system for admission: So, let’s try it the human way.  Tell me what you did during your life and I’ll see how it adds up.”  “Well, said the man, “I was married for 55 years to the same woman and never strayed.”  “Hmmm, let’s see, that’s 2 points.”  “And I went to church every Sunday!”  “Okaaaay…That’s 1 point.”  “Well, I also volunteered at a soup kitchen in our town and served homeless veterans each weekend!”  “Oh much better, that’s 3 points.”  “Wow, at this rate I’ll only get into Heaven by the grace of God!” exclaimed the frustrated man.   “COME ON IN!” replied a joyful St. Peter. \\n\\tAt first glance, the Luke passage today seems to be about what happens to us when we die.  It is really quite amazing how many different pictures Christians have of the existence and nature of an afterlife, the immortaility of the soul, if indeed they consider there to any afterlife at all. Some believe if you claim certain beliefs about Jesus, only then do you go to heaven when you die; if you claim the wrong belief or nothing at all you head for hell.  Some believe it’s a combination of how you live you life and what you say about Jesus.  Some believe they will be bodily resurrected at the second coming of Jesus.  And some, those called universalists, believe God’s love never leaves anyone behind and everyone’s soul or essence ends up eternally with God, and it’s a mystery what that is going to be.  Personally, I lean in the universalist direction as this view seems consistent with Jesus’ radical welcome and acceptance of all kinds of people.  \\n\\tReligious historians have noted that, in the United States, popular beliefs about heaven exploded during and following the Civil War. So many of our nations families were grieving the abrupt and early loss of their young men.  How could a loving and just God let the youth of the nation kill each other in such unimaginable numbers?   Historian Drew Gilpin Faust has written in her book about the This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War, that “the presence and fear of death touched Civil War American’s most fundamental sense of who they were, for in its threat of termination and transformation, death inevitably inspired self-scrutiny and self-definition.” (p. XV).  She suggests that this unexplained carnage and suffering visited on almost every home in the mid-19th century is one reason why there has been such an emphasis on the afterlife in American religious history.  \\n\\tWondering about the afterlife is always a component of our reflecting on this life.  When faced with the deplorable way we treat other human beings, warfare being a prime example, maybe it’s easier to think about heaven than to try and figure out “now what did all those years of war and soldier’s deaths really mean for us?”  I wonder if today’s scripture text from Luke has the Sadducees revealing less about what they think about the inhabitants of heaven and more what they think about living in community in the present.  Last Sunday, on All Saints Day, we celebrated what the Apostle Paul called a palpable “this cloud of witnesses” that surrounds us,  those who have died and gone on before us.  Approaching Veterans Day once again, we remember those who died by violence in war.  There is a poignant human yearning in all this.  As the theologian Marcus Borg has written that in all our different perspectives about what happens when we die, there runs a yearning for “moreness” (Marcus Borg, p 182, The Heart of Christianity).   Most of us have a deep sense that there is more than this life here on earth.  Drew Gilpin Faust suggests that the ghastly conundrum of Civil War deaths became the basis for our embracing a new notion of “the Good Death.”  And a new blurring the of lines between “duty to God and duty to county.”  When it comes to our everyday reality, I suspect we have a dream, a hope, of something wider, wilder, more just and good.  And some times it seems overwhelming to see that dream of goodness and justice and mercy happening in this life, within our conflict-ridden communities and nations.    \\n\\tWhat does this passage from Luke suggest about life after death?  At this point in Luke’s gospel Jesus has finally arrived in Jerusalem, where he will be arrested, questioned by his own people and then tried and murdered by the Romans.   The tension mounts in Luke’s narrative as first the Pharisees question him about his credentials: by what authority do you teach and heal, Jesus?  Then they challenge him with a political question about whether or not it is lawful for Jews to pay taxes to the Roman Emperor.  But in today’s passage, the Sadducees pull out all the stops and slam him with this strange provocation about remarriage and the after-life.  They have already decided for themselves, as it is well-known that the priestly class of Sadduces who oversee all Temple rituals do not believe in the immortality of the soul. \\n\\tWhen the Sadduces start to tell this complicated story about the woman with the seven husbands and who does she end up in afterlife with…well we just might think they are telling another heaven joke.   Is this about sex in heaven as one contemporary commentator slyly suggests (Don Clendenin)?  In heaven, which of the brothers will finally get the poor widow pregnant?  It’s such a convoluted story that there ought to be some funny punch-line about St. Peter setting them all up in some wife-swapping commune on a cloud. But the Sadduces were not going for laughs.  They are drop-dead serious religious leaders who sense their authority is being threatened.  They are looking to entrap Jesus with their wiley story about marital law and bodily resurrection.  And the Torah has specific instructions about how a man’s family name and lineage was to be sustained.  Everlasting life is in your ancestors before you and your descendents after you.  Period.  No where in the Torah, first five books of Hebrew scriptures, does it mention life after death.  The Saduccess rejected the later teachings of the prophets and any speculation that there might be life after death that appears in later apocalyptic literature, such as the Book of Daniel.  Humans live on through their children, in their view.  But it’s a trick question: they don’t believe in an afterlife and they are needling Jesus to weigh-in on this ridiculous baby-making-in-heaven scenario.\\n\\tAt this point, both the legal experts-Pharisees and the temple priest-Sadducees are concerned that Jesus teachings are too provocative and edgy..  Jesus is riling up the crowds of the common folk and making them all possible targets for increased Roman oppression.  These religious leaders are starting to feel threatened and scared.  Fear often gets us cranky and leads us to asking bad questions.   We start demanding things in irritated tones like: “what on earth are you doing?”  or “now what was it I said?” Or we begin to worry and fret, asking ourselves bad questions like: “how can protect myself in this situation; how can I keep everything the same and not make any changes in my life, my job, my church?  Or, how can I keep these strange and different people away from me?  \\nIn response to the Saducess bad question, Jesus simply shifts the focus.  God is with us even in death, is his point.  He doesn’t describe what this will be like, but it is clear that whatever happens, it includes saints and sinners alike.  We are “in” God now, we inhabit, swim in, breathe in, God’s transformative presence now and always; all of us.  Look back at your own Mosaic Law of the Torah, he challenges the Sadducees.  Moses said that his dead ancestor Abraham is with God.  God has a relationship with us in life and death, and that fact should permeate each moment we are conscious.  Jesus used the phrase “children of the resurrection” which is who we are.  This is how we remember to put God first, he says, its by remembering who you are.  Children of God, always in God.  All those things that occupy our lives while we are living, marriage and procreation, creating and producing; that’s not what life after death is about.  AND it’s not even the center point of THIS life.  This is the new vision Jesus gave his listeners; this is something to get out of bed in the morning for.  I have always believed that Gospel writers references to eternal life means right now.  Abundant life, life transformed as we live and move and have our very being in God.  Amen.  \\n',\n",
       " '\\tAs we approach Veteran’s Day again this year, I remember that my own father was only a small cog in a big wheel of a huge battle.  As I described in my Children’s Message just now, he played a small part in a very big war.  Yet for anyone who has worked on a combat mission, sports team or factory division or office workgroup, you know it takes all the little pieces working together.  Families know this, churches know this.  It takes everyone contributing his or her small piece.  \\n\\nOn this Veterans Day weekend, I imagine some of you are thinking of your own military service, of the men and maybe even women, who served with you.  All the small and seemingly insignificant pieces you or they contributed to war and peacetime efforts together.   Some of us think about family and friends who are connected intimately to us on this day; we might think of those who currently serve in Afghanistan or the Middle East, or are stationed anywhere around the globe, doing/giving their small parts of a huge effort by our nation to keep the peace, insure justice.  They do their part to, yes, enable the continuance of a certain way of life that we Americans have come to expect, with all the freedoms and the privileges that this way of life entails.   We might recall that there is not, at present, a draft and compulsory service in this country.  A very small percentage of our country actually fights our wars for us now, smaller than any time in our history.  Acknowledging of national observances like Veterans Day can get complicated!  While my dad’s generation experienced a general, although not full, agreement about “who is our enemy” and the need for our countries fight in both Europe and the Pacific, we really haven’t shared that kind of consensus about going to war as a nation since then.  We’ve seen debates about the Viet Nam War, Desert Storm, and more recent wars/invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq divide families and congregations.  Many of us want to honor veterans and support of current troops, yet few churches have on-going programs addressing the often nightmarish needs of our most recently returned veterans.  How do we acknowledge that Veterans Day is both a happy and sad day, as I described to the children.  How might we to respond to the enormous needs of the current group of returning veterans, as we look ahead to Veterans Day on this Wednesday?  What are we called to give?\\n\\nWe remember that it was 97 years ago, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month that the armistice with Imperial Germany and the Allied nations went into effect and the killing in Europe stopped.  Both my grandfathers, young men in their early 20’s, served in the trenches in northern France.  When I peppered my surviving Grampy with questions about life in the trenches however, he would only say with a solemn smile:  “well…the trenches of France were where I learned to drink black coffee.”  Answering my puzzled look, he continued, “because we couldn’t get cream and sugar in the trenches.”  And that was all he would say.   I remember pondering over this small detail, really the only child-appropriate detail concerning the hellish conditions of trench warfare, and a whole new world opened up to me.  Into my safe, bountiful, post WW II childhood experience of the world came a new awareness about not just wartime, but about less, having little….and learning to appreciate what you had. \\n\\n\\tJesus of Nazareth seemed to have a preference for little, insignificant things. In his teaching stories he would talk about little lost sheep, small coins misplaced in a house, tiny mustard seeds.  And today in Mark, this story of the widow dropping a miniscule gift, roughly equivalent to two pennies, in the Temple offering box.  The New Testament Gospel accounts record that Jesus spent a lot of time with the little, insignificant people of his time, the lowly street people, the reviled sex workers of his day, the resented tax collectors, the repulsive folks with leprosy, and all those scrappy bothersome poor people.  \\n\\nWe say in the Christian faith that Jesus is the visible sign of “God’s character and passion” (Marcus Borg, Heart of Christianity, p. 81).  I would guess that God must be pretty interested in little things and insignificant people too.  As I read through today’s story from Mark, I would dare say that God has a real passion for the small:  God is concerned about the underdog and the weak in our society, those without title or status or education or property, the people who seem “little” to us. \\n\\n\\tWe learn about God’s attention and concern as Jesus points out the widow in the temple, in today’s reading.  Jesus has been doing some people watching on the outskirts of the huge Temple in Jerusalem.  He notes this sharp contrast between the pompous giving of the scribes and the generosity of the woman with little money.  Scribes were not Jewish priests in the temple; they were actually a rich class of educated land owners, found in the urban centers and at that time, were often known for their manipulation of the poor, including powerless widows.  Lest we think of ourselves as too different from the scribes, we remember that most of us probably live well or even adequately in part from our own efforts, and also in large part, for many of us, because of the accident of our birth into particular skin color, families and communities.  We live well in part because others around the world live poorly.  This was the case of the first century scribes.  They lived well because of others’ poverty.  It is difficult for me to remember, as I marvel at some inexpensive item at my local big box store, that imported cheap goods are mostly made by people in factories who are brutally underpaid.  So small daily choices I make even in my shopping connects me with the rest of the world. \\n\\n\\tJesus wants us to consider the scribes disregard for and even misuse of the poor.  The also wants his listeners to notice the widow’s confidence, this woman with just a few coins.  She boldly walks up to the Temple offering boxes and gives everything she had.  She doesn’t hold back, paralyzed by thinking she is too old, too weak, or poor or insignificant to accomplish anything for God.  Small things done with faithfulness, with consistency.  This is the work of God’s kingdom, says Jesus.  \\n\\n\\tIt is important to remember in this interim time, this period between one settled pastor and your next settled pastor, that God can do much with small things.  Maybe you have never pledged before to a church, or haven’t pledged your financial support here in a long time.  For starters, it may help to remember that the size of a pledge is not the most important issue here.  I believe it is the intention, it is the claiming of a hopefulness, a willingness to engage in the unfolding future of this congregation, even if the pledge is for only a few dollars a week.  It’s the consistency in fulfilling that intention that begins to shape us through the year, as we commit ourselves to God’s work in and through this church.  Some would say it’s a discipline, that when practiced regularly, helps put a lot of things into perspective for us.  Our giving makes us more conscious about how we spend our money in general; we watch and are aware of each piece of spending that we do and each intention and value that this spending reflects.  Small daily activities, that add up over time and shape us into who God calls us to be.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps this Veterans Day weekend, it can be the daily small acts of bravery and compassion performed by our service men and women that inspires us.  What do we do here on the home front that furthers God’s hope for peace and justice in our world?  How might this church reach out to both active duty servicemen and women, and to our local veterans?   How might our church contribute to peacekeeping in our community?  Perhaps we might explore how this church could provide a forum for civil, respectful and peace-filled conversation about the controversial sidewalk issue emerging in Falcon Heights!  There are new small things that we have yet, with God’s guidance, to imagine. \\n \\nLet us not underestimate what God is doing now, and dreaming of doing in the future, through this church.  Size doesn’t seem to be an issue to our creative and transforming God.  God is simply looking for partners who will side with the vulnerable, the poor, the returning veteran who is struggling, the disenfranchised in our world.  Who will do these little but self-sacrificing things on their behalf, like the woman with the few coins?  God is asking us to be co-creators in taking little and creating much.  And how blessed we are to be invited into this partnership. Amen. ',\n",
       " 'In the pre-Christian northern Europe, late fall celebrations would focus on harvest, but also on dying: The dying season of autumn, the lurking presence of evil, and the thin veil between life and death itself.  In Christianized regions by the early 16th century, the old Celtic tradition of Samhain (saw-wain) had become All Hallows Eve, the special “hallowed” or holy day before all Saint’s Day.  We come to the year 1517, and a young German priest and university professor, Martin Luther, had become increasingly concerned about corrupt religious practices in the Church.  He knew that the Cathedral at Wittenberg would be packed with worshippers on All Saints, honoring those who had died for their faith. So the night before, on All Hallow’s Eve, Luther posted his 95 theses, his challenges to the Church, on the huge Cathedral door.   The statements condemned the Church’s selling of indulgences.  Local clergy, and the church hierarchy, all made money of off this system, which funded huge pubic building projects in far-away Rome.  You could buy a certificate which would eliminate your need for repentance of a particular sin you had committed, or a loved one’s soul could be sprung from purgatory.  Luther even claimed that the Bible, not just church tradition or the Pope’s rulings, was to be our sole guide in the Christian faith, and that it must be available in people’s own languages.  Lay people must be empowered to discern the movement of the Spirit, of the God who is still speaking, through the written scriptures and their own spiritual experiences.  \\nLuther’s provocative document was like a bomb, and would soon lead to a painful split in the Christian church.  Years of conflict followed, with hatred and spilled blood as Protestants also challenged repressive political structures and  envisioned the church of the future.  As the United Church of Christ, Protestants in the reformed tradition, we come from a long line of people who have looked into the future to see new things and spoken out honestly about what they saw.\\nThis story from Luke is the quintessential teaching of Jesus on prideful boasting and humility.  Perhaps the preacher should say: “Just Be Humble.  Amen!” and sit down.  But humility is problematic.  Was Luther being humble by claiming to see things differently than the Church of his day?  If we claim to be  humility, we aren’t really being humble anymore.  \\nWe are not sure just who was the target for this teaching parable that seems to be about humility.  The Gospel writer Luke records that “Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves,” but no one is named.  But isn’t it a good thing to be able to trust yourself?  To be able to have confidence in how we will act in public, and not fall prey to whim or sudden urgings?  “To some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous,” says the text.  But, what is the problem with this?  It doesn’t say self-righteous.  To be “righteous” for a first century Jew (Jesus’ primary audience) was a good thing: it meant that you were acting with integrity in your relationship with God and with others, doing justice and walking humbly before your God.  So, what is the problem with these “some” Jesus is talking to?  Here it comes:  “they were righteous and regarded others with contempt.\\nAnd….. who among us hasn’t quietly held someone in contempt this week?  I sometimes catch myself moving into silent distain as I see or hear of someone else acting pompous or lazy or irrational or wasteful or too evangelical.  Dear God, thank you that I am not like…..fill in the blank.  This can be an especially tempting thing to do on Reformation Sunday:  Dear God, thank you that I am part of a Protestant tradition that celebrates individual freedom and autonomy, diversity of belief…….not like those other churches!  There is even a lack of humility and a sense of distain on the tongue-in-check bulletin cover for today!  Is it really our job to try and “fix” someone else’s theology?  Hmmmmm.\\n       “They were righteous and regarded others with contempt,” notes Jesus.  And he has his listeners’ attention now.  He proceeds to tell a tale of a respected religious leader, a Pharisee.  In the story, the Pharisee simply offers thanks to God that he is not like certain other people.  Unlike us, Jesus’ 1st century listeners would be rooting for the Pharisee at this point.  Pharisees were highly respected as thoughtful religious reformers of their time.  Their goal was to relate the Law more liberally and more closely to everyday spirituality and people’s circumstances.  It was only later in the first century, when the relationships between the Jewish synagogues and new Christian communities were getting tense over different interpretation of the Law and the meaning of Jesus, that “Pharisee” starts being seen in a negative way. \\nThe Pharisee is doing all the right and righteous things, and is sharing these with God in a private prayer “standing by himself.”  “I fast, I give a large portion of my income to the needy.”   “Wow, what an admirable person,” Jesus’ audience is probably saying to themselves.  Jesus then introduces the tax collector, and everyone assumes this will be the villain in the story.  In that time, tax collectors were despised collaborators with the occupying Roman rulers.  “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” the tax collector cries.  And surprise, surprise, it is this man, speaking in dejected humility, who Jesus says is truly justified and accepted by God.   \\nAgain, Jesus surprises his listeners out of their everyday way of valuing behavior and worth.   If I’m not careful, I tend to lean into my own capacities, my productiveness, well….my upstandingness.  Perhaps we measure ourselves against others’ accomplishments.  We can become wary and even contemptuous of those unable to fend for themselves in our current economy.  Reassured by our capabilities, we might insist we don’t have much need for God’s help.  “It’s okay God, I’ve got it covered,” we may find ourselves praying; ever more trusting in our own self-sufficiency.   Not unlike the Pharisee, we get it about what kind of righteous life to lead….and we all become forgetful about the source of that righteous life.  The Pharisee prays to God, but has lost sight of his dependence on God, his source and sustainer.\\nYou may have noticed that the tax collector never actually repents in the story.  He doesn’t confess he has been excessive in his taxation of the locals, so he can profit.  But he starts in a place that most of us would like to avoid:  he acknowledges his total dependence on God.  And I think this idea makes most of us capable folks squirm.\\nMartin Luther’s challenge to the corrupt religious practices of the 16th century was this:  to assume God’s love for us does not rest on the merits of our behavior, or our abilities or our beliefs.  It’s all grace; it’s all God’s initiative, said Luther. We are held in this grace, we soak in it daily, and it’s our loss when we ignore it.  The tax collector gets it: he simply presents himself humbly to God’s merciful presence, which is there always.  Like most of Jesus’ stories, it’s about God’s persistent insistence that we are loveable and reformable all at the same time.  We can change, a congregation can be re-formed.  We can be transformed so we can better serve God’s healing purposes here on this broken and needy planet.\\nJesus “told this parable to some who trusted in themselves.”   So, perhaps we are each left with this question:  what do I trust beyond myself and my own capacities?  And any kind of trusting implies that I must humbly admit that I am not the center of my own small universe.  What do we trust beyond ourselves, our own perceptions, our own ego’s hunger to be right, to be secure, to be esteemed?   Questions to ponder in the week ahead.  Amen.\\n \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThis text from Deuteronomy, seems pretty straightforward: it’s better to chose life over death.  When we hear it starkly like that, there seems to be little more to say:  Of course…chose life over death!  That’s obvious, I can be down with that….wow, a 15 second sermon! Time for Coffee Hour!   But if “chose life over death” is so obvious, why is it so difficult to do?  Because it is so challenging, this may be why Moses spoke these words as his “last-will-and-testament” before he died.  Moses had led the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt, and helped them form into a community of justice and mercy under God’s guidance as they wandered for 40 years in the Exodus wilderness.  Now, finally looking out over the promised land of Canaan, the dying Moses gives the fledgling Jewish community these this final message:  Here is the deal, folks.  I won’t be going with you on this next part of your journey.  “I set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity.”    Walk in God’s ways, follow God’s commandments and don’t chase after idols.  You choose, life or death, blessings of land and plenty and loving God, or curses of no land and perishing.   But is life ever this black and white?  This is starting to sound pretty autocratic and harsh.   We might be inclined to simply dismiss this reading; it’s the Old Testament, right, that’s all about God’s law and judgment and the New Testament is all about God’s love!    \\n\\n\\tOn to the New Testament reading from the Gospel of Matthew, for something a little more….. palatable? Cheery?  More loving?  And here is Jesus, appearing to double-down on teachings “of ancient times” and making everything way harsher.  These are not casual behavior suggestions. These words of Jesus are clearly directive: they exhort; they tell us in no uncertain term what to do and what not to do.  More hackle-raising scripture texts, we may mutter to ourselves.  We could have everyone stand up and go to one of four corners in the Sanctuary, depending on what offends us most in this Matthew passage:  Everyone bugged by Jesus’ view on resentment and anger being worse than murder, go to the far corner on that side?  Don’t like Jesus saying that lust and leering are worse than adultery?  Repulsed by the injunctions to cut off offending parts of our bodies?  Go to the far corner on the other side.  Offended to hear that remarrying is connected to adultery?  Hang out up here with me, because as someone went through a divorce in her mid-30’s, I’m really annoyed about that one.  And this final whopper, don’t swear by anything!  Gather up here on the other side of the chancel if you think swearing by God, the Bible or your mother’s grave is better than lying.   Which one of these four commandments bug you the most?  And you thought the ancient Torah teachings of the Law were tough? says Jesus.  Check out what I’m going to ask you to do if you want to follow me, if you want to actually live compassionately and harmoniously in community.  Choosing life over death has now become more complicated.\\n\\tThe problem with being told to do or not do something is that we often bristle, feel resistant, perhaps even a bit defensive.  Anyone having ever been around a toddler knows that this starts at about age 2.  At that age, we are beginning to develop a sense of our self as separate from our parents/caregivers, and this involves some inevitable challenging of authority.  “No!” the 2 year old delights is saying, with ferocious enthusiasm!  As we become older and start to separate from our parents, we grow as a separate individual who is still connected to a family unit.  And we often define ourselves by who our family is not.  In 8th grade I declared I was an atheist, in part because my parents were not.  As a senior in high school I became strongly evangelical in my Christian faith, in part because my progressive church-going parents were most assuredly not evangelical Christians.  Both of these religious stands had to do in part with my striving to do (what psychologists have come to call) the necessary “separation and individuation” to become an autonomous adult.      \\nAs adolescents and young adults, many of us talk of wanting to be “free” but we are not yet sure just what this might mean.   This happens often in more progressive church.  But “free” for what?  As an adult, I have come to realize that simply being oppositional to authority, without figuring out for myself what I value and believe, was a dead end. I might be against this or that, but what was I ultimately for?   \\n\\tI think this passage from Matthew gives us guidance on that really “ups the ante” when it comes to living in community….To figuring out what we are free for…. Paradoxically, these ways of living may lead to what can make us the most free: choosing life over death on a daily basis, in our every-day choices. \\nBut we have to be careful not to pull Jesus’ words out of their historical and cultural context.  Take care not to get diverted by today’s translation that has Jesus saying you’ll “be liable to the hell of fire.”  The actual word is not hell, but Gehanna.  In Jewish tradition, this word referenced an actual valley where long ago people used to sacrifice children to the Canaanite god Moloch.  Like saying to naughty children, “you hit your brother again and we will send you to Gehanna”…or fill in the blank for whatever scarey institution like a prison or mental hospital was down the road.  \\t \\nJesus had an uncanny way of understanding the perceptions, attitudes and emotions that often come before an act that is contrary to God’s Law.  Before there is murder, adultery, divorce or swearing falsely, there is a subtle but significant shift in how we are thinking and feeling.  And that shift is what Jesus was concerned about, because these shifts can move us towards deadening spiral in our lives.  We loose vitality and we begin to hurt ourselves and other people.   We start to choose death, not life.\\n\\t(Dr. Amy Oden, professor of Church History at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, WorkingPreacher.org commentary, Epiphany 6A).   In Jesus’ time, simply following the rules meant that in both the patriarchal Jewish and Roman society any married woman could be divorced and discarded quite easily.  It took us until the 20th century to pass laws in this country that protect women from automatically loosing their property, children and livelihood when a marriages ends.  First century women lost everything; they were left destitude. This isn’t right, said Jesus.  Participation in the Kingdom of God entails a different kind of righteousness.  It’s about a mutual compassion and support that brings mercy and justice to human intention and behavior.  \\n\\tIn considering Jesus’ command about murder, Professor Oden admits that when we are in disagreement with someone else in our church community, few of us actually consider killing that person.  But how many times have we been angry over some perceived slight or some unresolved misunderstanding in the church? In an effort to be polite or keep the peace, we choose a small death: we either keep it inside or we go “sideways” and tell someone else about how bothered we are, venting, hoping that word will be “passed along”  It amazes me that while Jesus never founded a church like we know it today, he was spot-on about one of the most common problems in congregations:  unresolved conflict which simmers and seeps and moves side-ways, and sucks the life and trust out of a congregation. Thriving churches learn that everyone should be heard, but everyone doesn’t always get their way.  Churches increasing in vitality such as ours are exploring how to handle inevitable disagreements with honesty and compassion.  Thanks be to God.\\n\\tOne thing I find so compelling about Jesus is his ability to see inside people.  In following the Spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, I am helped to see inside myself.  I’m become more aware as I am faced with choices between life-giving attitudes and actions, and between death-giving attitudes and actions.  \\nThis indwelling Spirit helps me honestly face the stuff on the inside, my internal orientation that initiates my actions.  “This is where the choosing life or death really lies,” implies Jesus.   It’s way before the murderous action; it is in the resentment and grudges we harbor.  It is way before the adulterous affair; it is in the way we pay more attention to work, sports or the Internet instead of our life partner (Amy Oden, IBID).   The choice is way before the actual divorce; it is in the slow breakdown of communication and mutual respect.  It’s way before the swearing falsely, it is in our equivocating.  It is when we refuse to let our “yes” be “yes” and our “no” be “no.”   Choosing life or death.\\nMay we be challenged to our bones by these words from both Moses and Jesus.   For these teachings are freedom-filled and life-giving.  They help us choose life.  Amen. \\n',\n",
       " '\\t\\tA group of us gathered this past week for our wrap-up meeting for the Emergency Cold Weather Shelter.  A few were from social services, the rest of us from different local congregations.   Immanuel Church has been involved since the shelter started about 7 years ago.  Open from December through the end of March, the shelter provides a clean bed, hot food and connection to local services for those who are homeless.  It’s an amazing outreach to DC”s most vulnerable people during the cold winter months.  I’ve been working with the fundraising committee:  inviting people and groups to help pay for the overnight monitors who staff the shelter, utilities, rent, supplies, laundry, equipment.  Some of you participated in our By-a-Bed campaign this fall and we were able to buy 22 new portable beds, blankets and pillows.  It’s not a huge operation, and homelessness is a growing and complex problem across the nation.  But up to 20 men, women and children can be sheltered a night, and more importantly, can be connected with resources to turn their lives around.  The community supports this program really well: local congregations, individuals, businesses, foundations and other non-profits.  And I was delighted and so proud of Immanuel when I looked at the figures.  Of the 17 churches that sent funding, Immanuel provided over 1/3 of the total amount this year coming that came from the local religious community!   What a witness!  \\n\\tThe other amazing thing about the shelter program is how many congregations and civic groups want to prepare and bring hot meals for the guests.   Immanuel has been lucky to get to provide meals for two Thursday a month; the competition is hot!   It has intrigued me why this is so popular….\\n\\tThere is something so powerful in being able to provide food, isn’t there. A lot of us feel perplexed and frustration about poverty and homeliness.  We are confused as to why people are chronically unable to support themselves.  We know the reasons are numerous, from mental illness to addiction to few jobs to chronic illness to racial inequality to lack of training…… to hopelessness, disempowerment, stuckness.   This may be why providing meals, going down and serving this vulnerable people, strikes such a chord in many of us.  It is so concrete.  When we lack the explanations, the words, the solutions to big problems, we bring food.  It’s true when someone is sick, when someone is hurt, when someone dies, when someone is in need.  Bring a casserole, a piece of coconut cake, hot soup.  And the food itself breaks the ice for us.  “Here’s a little something if you feel like eating.”  “I’m here for you” – the food says.  I bring you myself and my caring.  We are bringing God’s love and compassion to that person, in our presence and our covered dish.   It isn’t called comfort food for nothing.  \\n\\t\\tThese resurrections appearances of Jesus:  it’s always with the food already!  Here we are again.  Another resurrection appearance of Jesus, complete with the same greeting we heard in last week’s passage: “Peace be with you.”  And he shows them his wounds: “hey look, a ghost doesn’t have flesh and bones like this.”  Same initial reaction by the frightened disciples who are in hiding, certain the authorities will arrest them for being a follower of Jesus.  And pretty darn certain that if what the women said was true, that Jesus has risen from the dead, this Jesus will NOT be pleased to see them.  And here is Jesus, calmly, lovingly, greeting them again.  And again, he asks for something to eat!   No big showy display of lights and power.  “Peace be with you,” he says again.  “Oh, and can I have something to eat?”  What?  I can see them all scurrying around, looking for dinner leftovers.  Oh here!  Some broiled fish!  They settle back in awe and watch Jesus eat.\\n\\tIt’s funny with these resurrection appearances; noting big or flashy really happens.  Jesus does the same stuff he always did with people.  He extended God’s peace to them:  Peace be with you.   He ate with them.  No wonder some of the religious leaders called Jesus a glutton and a winebibber when he was ministering among their communities.  Jesus was always hanging out around this or that table, eating with all kinds of riff-raff and unacceptable people, like poor folks and women and tax collectors and lepers.  Divisions between what is sacred and what is secular seemed to disappear.  Apparently, as far as Jesus was concerned, it was all God’s world and all redeemable and all precious.  And while they ate and laughed and talked together, Jesus would open up the meaning of the scriptures and talk about how God was working in their midst, right now.  All while he munched on bread and broiled fish, took a gulp of the local wine, talked and taught, laughed and continued eating.  So. Very. Ordinary.  \\n\\tIs it true, that wherever food shows up, we find God in action?   Apparently God of the ancient Hebrew people intended that there be enough manna for everyone.  God taught them that hoarding stinks and that they were to take just what they needed for each day.   We all have to eat.  Extending hospitality to the stranger in your midst was also a central part of their culture.  One never knew if one was entertaining angels.  \\n\\tWe live in a world where some people have way more than they need and a lot of people go to bed hungry each night.  Where food shows up, I do think that is God in action.   Think about this as you sit down to lunch today.  The miracle of putting food into our bodies and it transferring into energy for our lives.  Ponder this as shop for food, as you cook food, as someone serves you food in the next few days.  As you break bread or broiled fish with people you love, as you do it with strangers you don’t know or understand. \\n\\tOver and over in the resurrection appearances, the disciples don’t recognize Jesus until he starts eating.  Then they get it that Jesus is still with them in the concrete, everydayness of their lives.  We too are hungry for divine companionship and shared community with others.  Can we recognize the spirit of the Risen Jesus among us as we break bread and fish together, as we share bread and fish with those in need?  We too are eager to extend this open hospitality to others, even when we don’t really understand the whys and hows of their needs.  We want to give witness to the generosity we have been shown.   Jesus is at the table with us.  Where food shows up, God is at work.  Thanks be to God.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThis passage from Luke contains a one of Jesus’ stranger stories: a wiley estate manager gets called out and canned…… but not before giving us a peak into the local practices for transacting goods and services.  And having the supposedly dishonest steward praised for making friends by means of dishonest wealth!  I was pleased to learn this parable has confounded Biblical scholars down through the ages.  As I wrestled with the text, I kept getting snagged on this last part about the impossibility of serving both God and wealth.  Who and what we are willing to serve and follow in the normal transactions of our lives?  I found myself humming a snippet of a tune, repeating a refrain I couldn’t quite place:  “you gotta serve somebody” round and round in my head. Thank you God for Internet search engines; there it was:\\nYou may be an ambassador to England or France,\\n\\nYou may like to gamble, you might like to dance,\\n\\nYou may be the heavyweight champion of the world,\\n\\nYou may be a socialite with a long string of pearls\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\\n                     \\nYou're gonna have to serve somebody,\\n      \\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody.\\n\\nBob Dylan in the late 1970’s, echoing, probably unintentionally, this ancient story Biblical theme about ultimate allegiance which guides daily decisions.   Uncannily, Dylan hits the issue spot-on:  Whoever you are, you end up sometimes unwittingly serving evil or good.  You don’t think you have to chose? Dylan taunts.  Think again. \\n\\tWhat do our daily choices say about whom or what we serve?  What would my life really look like, or your life, if we could say “I serve God.”  ?  Or put in specifically Christian terms: “I follow Jesus, that is how I serve God.” ?  Where we put our attention, our dollars, our time, our daydreams, our appetites, our energies, even our hopes>   It’s so everyday, this choice-making; it is easy to loose track of how “who we serve” is played out in our daily lives, choice by choice. \\n\\tIf we are to listen to a certain vocal portion of Christian America, we might think that Jesus spent most of his time talking about marriage and sexual orientation.  But the four Gospel narratives each have Jesus repeatedly talking about money and things connected to money, like riches, status and poverty. Encounters with and stories about rich people, poor people, treasuries and investments, wages and debts; so many references to money.   From shear volume alone, we know that Jesus believed money mattered and that our use of money speaks very clearly about our spiritual health, our relationship with God and with our fellow humans.\\n\\t  Within the Hebrew language scriptures of Jesus’ time, there were various messages about money, wealth and poverty.  Faithfulness meant being generous.  The whole society was to take care of those living in poverty among them, the orphans, the widows, the needy in their midst.  It was considered a “mitzvah” or a blessing to do so.  Money was never evil per se; but its use was seen as morally complicated.  Not just individuals were to be generous and just; this was the job of the whole society.  The Jewish prophets were continually railing against their leaders and members of the establishment of their day:  their people’s wider purpose was to create a society of fairness and justice, where slaves were eventually released, huge debts were routinely forgiven, and the extreme gaps between wealth and poverty were reduced.  Uncomfortable reminders for us, in a time when our nation’s supplemental food programs and health care opportunities for the poor continue to be undercut.\\n\\tLast week, we considered Jesus’ stories about God who is searching out those we might consider “lost” or unfit for society’s inclusion.  Without skipping a beat, Jesus now turns to his followers and tells today’s odd story:  “There was a rich man,” he begins and everyone in the vicinity perks up.  Apparently, fascination with the lives of the rich and famous is as old as the hills.  \\nBut if we are looking for guidance on how to deal with our finances, today’s story seems to careen off into an unexpected affirmation of shrewdness and dishonesty.  I can just picture the disciples looking at each other in confusion.  The previous stories about the lost were Jesus’ response to the charge that he consorted with sinners.  This story appears to be about sin that involves money, and the ongoing challenge of serving two masters, having both God and money in your life.  But what is Jesus doing here?  \\n\\tJesus never implied that people of wealth were inherently evil.  But Jesus did have an uncanny way of revealing that, as one Biblical commentator has noted, “how we relate to money is a barometer of how we relate to God.”  (Don Clendenin, 17C Blog)  This starts to hit close to home, doesn’t it?  The way I relate to money, the way I think about money and the way I handle my finances is a kind of measure of the mood, the atmospheric pressure we could say, between me and God.  “Jesus doesn’t hesitate to use money as a yardstick to measure our spiritual health,” writes the contemporary theologian, Don Clendenin.  Yikes.  Maybe it would be less provocative if we talked about sex…\\n\\tBut what about this parable?  A certain rich man’s manager is abruptly brought up on charges of mismanagement (squandering, just like the Prodigal son wasting his inheritance) and immediately loses his job.  The wealthy owner demands an accounting of his work before he leaves.  The manager is thrown into a panic  and scrambles to figure out he can stay afloat, and still be welcome in his neighbor’s homes.  He proceeds to collect from several of his boss’s debtors, probably by reducing the interest money he as manager could receive and thereby remaining friends with his neighbors.  He is praised by the rich boss because of his ability to wisely read the situation he finds himself in and do something about it, and make his master look generous at the same time.\\n\\tIf there is any teaching edge to this perplexing parable, we are coming close here.  Notice Jesus’ comment at the end of the story:  “make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest (actually worldly) wealth so that when it is gone, the children of this age may welcome you into their eternal tents” (is the actual translation).  Tents, not home; life on the move in God’s Kingdom, where one’s treasured position and possessions can change in a flash.  Maybe Jesus is pushing us to see that our security lies elsewhere.  Could it be that the dishonest manager is praised because, in a crisis, he reaches out below himself, to those in debt to his boss?  In what way might connections between us and those on other rungs of the financial ladder be shrewd or wise?  Is Jesus reminding us that the rich and the poor are more connected then they know?  That our financial status can be fleeting, and we need to be careful not to cling to it?  Jesus speaks of life in a tent rather than a building like a home; unpredictable, ready to pick up and move as the Spirit leads.  Lots of questions to consider this week.  \\n\\tEach of our financial situations is different, but I invite us to keep re-visiting this text and see where it leads us this week.  As we handle our money, write a check, take out a debit or credit card, let’s wonder about security and just who we actually serve. Jesus is pretty blunt at the end of this passage.  We cannot serve God and wealth.   Most of us have not taken monastic vows of poverty; most of us are not extraordinarily wealthy.  We’re muddling through all this along some kind of middle way.  Jesus invites us to wonder and question about money, the possibilities and the challenges it brings to each of us.  And so might we pray and ponder in the days ahead.  Because \\n“we're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\\n                     \\nwe're gonna have to serve somebody,  Amen. \",\n",
       " '\\n\\tI have come to realize that, all to often, I just don’t want my personal peace disturbed.  I find I don’t want someone else to inconvenience my day with the facts about the tough realities that are happening outside of my immediate perceptions.  Please don’t inconvenience me with your request for spare change, or with one of those cardboard signs asking for help!  And for goodness sake, don’t stop traffic with another one of those 4.5 minute die-ins where everyone lies in the road in memory of the 4.5 hours that Michael Brown lay dead on the street in Fergeuson!  A part of me is reluctant to face that there has been more deaths since then of a people of color in police custody or that systemic racism just isn’t going away.  It is difficult it is to hear about all kinds of things these days, isn’t it?  My imagination gets overloaded, exhausted; I get compassion fatigue.   It’s difficult to hear about yet another Syrian refugee being interviewed on Minnesota Public Radio.  Because it hurts to listen, I’m not sure how to respond, and I feel powerless and frustrated.  And sometimes I begin to feel hopeless that God’s promises of a whole new world of justice and peace might be even possible.    Was yesterday’s march on the Fair grounds disorienting and irritating for some of us because it was yet another reminder of promises broken among us?   Promises of peace, justice, equality and freedom for all?  \\n\\tIn so many ways, we Christians are people of the “not yet.”  Over and over we are challenged to lift up dreams and visions of God’s promises being fulfilled, in a world where they are not…yet.  This is not easy when there is such rancor and divisiveness over how to fix what is wrong and hurtful in our communities. The vitriol and the death threats sent to the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Twin Cities these last few days has been chilling.  We claim we are people of the promises of God.  Are we naïve or prescient when we speak of God’s promised actions?   Are we stuck in wishful thinking or prophetic about a possible new world order?\\n\\n\\tThrough the Sundays of August, our congregation has been exploring and testifying to ways God has touched our lives.  We have used the different parts of the United Church of Christ Statement of Faith, which is addressed to God and celebrates God’s deeds among us.  It was written not as a creed to test faith, but as a testimony to our denomination’s founders’ experience of God.  We have added these hangings each Sunday, lifting up the words in our midst.  The Statement is included in the Falcon Heights Church Constitution as the basis of the “common purpose, faith and covenant” of this church.  Today, we have reached the last portion, which is about the promises God has made to all who trust God.  Promises described over and over in our holy scripture.\\n\\n\\tBut who says these things are promised to us, we might ask.  Written in the Bible?  Well, excuse me….but so what?  For many people the phrase “the Bible says so” just doesn’t carry the weight it once did.  A passage like this one from the Book of Jeremiah, where the Hebrew prophet extols the wonder and beauty of God’s law, God’s holy word, sounds strange to us.  The writer talks of finding God’s words and eating them!  They become a joy to him and the delight of his heart.  The Rev. Dr. Roger Shinn, who taught Christian Social Ethics at Union Thelological Seminary, was part of the crafting of this Statement of Faith in the late 1950’s.  He wrote that its natural for us to “wonder how men and women of the Bible knew and verified God’s promises.”  We want to be able to “trust but verify” a promise, as former President Reagan used to say to his negotiating partners in the Soviet Union.   You and I have a post-Enlightenment, scientific perspective on things, and we want quantifiable, verifiable truth!  But Roger Shinn challenges us: “surely they (people in Biblical times) reflected upon their experience as intensely as we do on ours.  But when they talked of God’s promises, they were less inhibited in their imagination than we….they took their visions and dreams more seriously than we.”  (from Rev. Michael W.Lowry, ). \\n\\n\\tLet’s read today’s portion of the Statement of Faith together, which is addressed to God, as printed on the front of our service bulletin. I invite you to try the words on as you read them, even if this isn’t your inclination or your faith tradition.  See how they sound in your head as you speak the words; listen to the words flow around you as others speak.  Let’s read together:\\nYou promise to all who trust you\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0forgiveness of sins and fullness of grace,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0courage in the struggle for justice and peace,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0your presence in trial and rejoicing,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and eternal life in your realm which has no end.\\nBlessing and honor, glory and power be unto you.  Amen. \\n\\n\\tAs we consider this portion, what’s your own understanding about trusting God?  Does it mean you have to try really hard to literally believe each and every Bible story and teaching?  But in this portion, the words are not, “you promise to all who believe in you.”  It says trust.  I find this helpful.  Some days I’m not quite sure what I actually believe about Jesus’ resurrection, what happened, how or if.  But I can tell you, I have come to trust the reality of resurrection in my life, in the life of others, in communities.  I’m learning to trust in this idea of new life coming out of death, I lean into it.  For me, It’s an act of leaning into the possibility of resurrection, of transformation, and not thinking a thought or forcing a belief about something that defies modern day physics.\\n  \\n\\tWhat’s your dream about forgiveness?  Can you trust it as a process? What’s your hope about being loved and accepted in spite of your mistakes and the ways you have hurt people or stepped away from responsibility?   What’s your vision of God’s fullness of grace being extended to you…..openly, steadily, quietly, powerfully?\\n\\n\\tDo you imagine, do you dream, of having more courage?  What would that look like in your life?  Do you yearn to better understand black experience in this country but feel confused and hopeless about where to start?  As a white person grappling with my part in the struggle for racial justice and peace I have to be accountable for my part in systemic racism.  Since I heard that she spoke at the Annual Meeting of our Minnesota Conference of the UCC in June, I have wanted to read Jennifer Harvey’s book Dear White Christians: For Those Still Longing for Racial Reconciliation.  She is a young, white, American Baptist minister and professor of religion at Drake University in Iowa.  I have a vision of reading that book with some of you, to continue the conversation on race that some of you started with me last winter.   Do you share this vision?  Shall we explore her work together?\\n\\n\\tSometimes I really have to stretch my imagination to sense this Biblical promise of God’s presence in trial and rejoicing that the Statement claims.  I literally have to picture it in my minds eye, sense it in my body, speak it in my head.  Biblical people were way better at this than most of us.  As I soak in scripture I learn how to sense God’s presence better. “ All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work,” we just read from the second letter to Timothy, 3:16.  Myself, I long to be taught; I know I need some loving reproof.   I hope to be more proficient and equipped to do good work on God’s behalf.  I yearn to embrace eternal life in this moment, to live abundant life with each breath I take, and when breath leaves me in the mystery of death. I imagine you do too. \\n\\n\\tI invite you to join me in stretching our imaginations this fall.  Let’s dream some dreams and share our visions about the promises of God being fulfilled in our midst.  Let’s read and talk together about our hopes for a more racially just society.  Let’s imagine what our roles as followers of Jesus might be in making these promises come true.\\n\\n\\tBlessing and honor, glory and power be unto you, O God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",
       " \"\\t\\tThe Gospel of John tells us nothing about the tender birth stories of Jesus.  We might even wonder why we read this portion from John on Christmas Day. These lofty, even vague sounding words about “in the beginning” – pointing to a time long long ago time, way before Jesus was born in human form!  Sometimes I wonder if the author didn’t want to be limited to a historical time-line.  All those place and people oriented details!   Annunciations to an older couple, then a young woman, Joseph dreaming, the wisemen following a star, the journey to Bethlehem, a baby born in a stable, shepherds freaking-out in a field, everyone rushing at the manger, Herod’s anger, the frightened family fleeing finally to Egypt.  \\n\\tJohn unhinges us from the detail and goes cosmic.  He echoes the language of the Hebrew Bible, from the Book of Genesis:  In the beginning\\xa0God created\\xa0the heavens\\xa0and the earth.\\xa02\\xa0Now the earth was formless\\xa0and empty,\\xa0darkness was over the surface of the deep,\\xa0and the Spirit of God\\xa0was hovering\\xa0over the waters.\\n3\\xa0And God said,\\xa0“Let there be light,” and there was light.\\xa04\\xa0God saw that the light was good,\\xa0and he separated the light from the darkness.\\xa05\\xa0  \\n John describes the coming of Jesus, the Incarnation, with abstract metaphor, with poetry, offering a different take on….this mystery of “God with Us” and “in the flesh.”\\n\\t\\tWriting in Greek, John uses language familiar to the Greek speaking world of his cosmopolitan middle eastern first century community.  In the beginning was the Word – the Logos - his readers would be reminded of “logic,” in Greek philosophy, and also to an animating energy.  In the beginning was the life energy of the universe….and this life energy has become flesh.  Not an abstract philosophical formulation, but flesh!  Scandalous! \\n\\tJohn’s community was also filled with Hebrew speaking Jewish Christians.  The Word – dabar in Hebrew – also meant the Torah – their holy Law – believed also to be an animating force that existed at the beginning of creation and as co-creator with God.  Jews delighted in the “Word” of God, in the teachings of the Torah, They remembered the prophet Jeremiah’s image of finding God’s words and eating them, symbolically consuming them into one’s being because they are so precious.  Perhaps this gives us an inkling of how central “Word” was for John’s readers.   \\n\\t\\tAs a twenty-first century person, I imagine cosmic, animating primordial energy, exploding into creation.  Like stardust from the Big Bang, this energy now dwells among us.  John brings it closer to home: this life energy sets up a dwelling, actually the word is a tabernacle, a home among us.  The Life Energy of the Universe camps out with us in the everydayness of our lives. \\n\\t\\tAnd this Word – it shines!  Whatever this mystery is, this incarnate Word, it comes also as light.  It comes into our darkness.  It is not overcome by any darkness.  And this what may be so counter-cultural about the Gospel message, in a world such as our filled with such darkness.  A world filled with such imperfection, so damaged, so seemingly broken.   \\n\\tIt was the contemporary poet and song-writer Leonard Cohen who wrote:\\nRing the bells that still can ring\\nForget your perfect offering\\nThere is a crack in everything\\nThat's how the light gets in.\\nFrom Anthem,\\xa0Leonard Cohen, 1934 – 2016\\n\\n\\n\\tJesus will encounter people at the places where they were cracking – blindness, debilitating illness, people who were paralyzed by fear, shame and hopelessness.  Jesus will move into the cracks between the acceptable people and the marginalized people….between religious rulers, the weathy, the political elite and those living in poverty, the outcast, the tax collectors and the unclean.  Jesus was never looking for perfection….He looked for the cracks of vulnerability where people might receive him.  The spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ is looking for those cracks in us still.\\nForget your perfect offering\\nThere is a crack in everything\\nThat's how the light gets in.\\nThis Word, this Logos, that has always been here…comes here on Christmas Day in a deeper fuller way.  Giving us power to become children of God, says John.  Perhaps we too get “birthed” on Christmas.  You and I get drawn into the birthing process, as God seeks to birth new life in and through us.  As humans, we are already God’s creation, God’s children.  And yet, something unique and mysterious shows up in Jesus, enabling us to see God’s love manifested.  And in opening to this one, his ongoing presence among us, our sibling-hood is revealed more fully.  Our connections with one another.  That’s the picture John was trying to paint for his community.  Brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ; an unlikely mix of folks all in one family of God.    A motley mix, called to love one another, forebear one another, support one another in creative new ways.  Letting God’s new life be born through them,out into the world.  Perhaps not unlike those of us here at Falcon Heights Church.  The light shines in the darkness.  We are children of God.  Merry Christmas and Amen.  (Silence and ponder:\\nWhat is God birthing in me this day?\\n\\n \",\n",
       " 'Church potlucks, a beloved tradition in a wide variety of congregations, have been the brunt of media jokes for years.   Saturday Night Live “Church Lady” parody; quips about typical Lutheran church cuisine on Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie Home Companion.  But since most of my ministry was spent in northern California, my most memorable potluck experiences were a curious combination of jello-mold salads as well as freshly steamed artichokes with aioli dip.  I remember standing in one potluck line following an ordination service in a foody-sophisticated Marin County congregation just north of San Francisco.  I was joking with a colleague about the difference between San Fernando Valley farming communities church potlucks of jello-salad and bean-mushroom-soup-canned onion rings fame and this spread of fresh salmon, leafy salads and piles of, yes, artichokes laid before us that afternoon.   Looking back, I realize I had not only disparaged certain regional food of the Valley, but that I had also made a somewhat classist comment.  Years later I moved to Minnesota and more humbly acquired new potluck vernacular as the mysteries of tater-tot hot dish, lefhsa and dessert bars soon revealed themselves.   Clearly, food can unify and it can divide.  It can make you feel at home; it can make you feel like a stranger in a crowd.  Inclusive, exclusive.  \\nAs we look at this passage from Acts, we might well wonder what all the fuss was about for the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.   They were grilling the Apostle Peter about his associations with outsiders: “Peter, why are you eating with those uncircumcised, gentile people?  You know their food choices do not adhere to our sacred purity code!  You become impure yourself by eating with them; their food may have already been offered to idols!”  This conversation may seem like splitting hairs to us: kosher, nonkosher, ritually clean and unclean food.  But try having a group of friends over for dinner these days without first inquiring as to who is now vegetarian, who is still vegan, who is locavore only, who is revisiting the South Beach diet. \\nHow might Peter’s strange vision, of a sheet descending down from the sky and filled with all kinds of animals and birds, gives us a glimpse of God’s new intentions?  How did a curious assembly of creatures, all of which were considered non-Kosher, unclean, to Peter, give this observant Jewish apostle of Jesus an intuitive flash of God’s new directions in redeeming the world?  The jumble of animals on a table cloth draws on ancient, heavenly banquet table imagery of God’s coming reign of justice and peace for all.  And not unlike a welcoming church potluck, it is a vision of all kinds of people bringing all kinds of food.  Think about it:  church potlucks are a place where we gather together trusting in each other’s cooking abilities and cleanliness standards and we try new things.  \\nPeter recounts this bizarre vision to the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who still believe that followers of Jesus, of the Way, should also adhere strictly to Jewish dietary and circumcision laws.  Peter has been of similar mind, but something has started to change within him as he sees so many different kinds of people drawn to the teachings and presence of Jesus.  Now, in an effort to explain not only why he was sharing food and lodging with gentiles, Peter has to justify why the Roman (gentile) centurion Cornelius was allowed to be baptized as a new Christian.    We might well imagine Peter’s own revulsion at the vision of clearly non-kosher animals such as pigs, shellfish and reptiles, tumbling together on the descending cloth.  But apparently God is not too concerned by what seems distasteful to us, which may be important to remember.  “Get up, Peter; kill and eat.”  “But Lord, Peter replies sanctimoniously, “I never consume profane or unclean food,” as his stomach probably is churning and what he is really thinking is “eeeew…Lord, you have to be kidding me.”   “Peter,” replies the voice, “what God has made clean, you must not call profane.”   \\nPeter continues with his story in front of the circumcised believers in Jerusalem.  “And not only that, but these men appeared, who were obviously Gentile, and the Spirit told me to not worry about that but to head to the town of Joppa and preach the good news to this entire household of Gentiles, Cornelius’ very house, and the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning!”  “Now tell me, my brothers and sisters in Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?”  And the room of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem fell silent.  They are reminded of their own prophets’ insistent teaching that God’s intention was to reach out beyond their religious tradition to include the whole world in redemption.  Suddenly these Jerusalem Christians break into praise, proclaiming, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.” \\nI make an inner note to myself as I ponder this passage: Pay attention to what you may find to be a tad revolting as you move through the coming days, Anne.  And surely, we will each bump into someone, some situation this week, that will make our nose wrinkle or our stomach churn.  Notice what or who seems distasteful, unclean or just plain tacky.  It will be different for each of us, but we are bound to encounter a part of humanity that we would just as soon exclude from our circle. The gossipy friend, the whiney relative, someone in a same sex relationship or speaking with a foreign-sounding accent, someone with just too many tattoos or the wrong color skin.   We might want to pay attention to our discomfort, as there may be a signal for us about the new thing that God is up to next.  Like God giving “even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life” we read in the Book of Acts.   \\nAs if a tablecloth full of animals and birds isn’t enough strange metaphor for one Sunday, the author of Revelation presents us with vision of a city radiant and holy as a bride, descending to earth.  Frankly my inner feminist bristles at  this bridal imagery, but again, I remind myself, think metaphorically!  In the ancient world, cities were invariably represented by the feminine.  Apparently, Roman sculpture often depicted conquered cities as shackled female slaves.  How’s that for the denigration of a certain gender?  The author of Revelation, writing under the cover of metaphor, is doing something different.  In this pointed political diatribe denouncing the vile, gaudy, imperial corruption of the Roman Empire, he envisions God redeeming our whole planet.   Unlike modern day misrepresentations of the Book of Revelations, such as the Left Behind series, here we have an image of God making the earth itself new.  There is actually no rapture or snatching up of faithful Christians away from nasty earth in this book.  As one Bible commentator so aptly puts it:  People aren’t raptured up; God is actually raptured down to us.  (working preacher. org)  Whoa, that’s a vision to ponder as we move through next week.  “See,” says the loud voice from the throne, “the home of God is among mortals; God will dwell with them; they will be God’s peoples.”  Where do you see God dwelling among us, even now?\\nThe author’s world was totally captive to Rome’s unjust imperial domination.  But his vision doesn’t talk about escaping this place; it describes earth being transformed.  Earth being the place where all will be saved, all tears wiped away, where unjust systems will be dismantled, justice and reconciliation will reign. God here, in our dwelling and living and eating with one another.   \\nJesus continually reminded his followers that their love for one another would uniquely show people his love.  In the faith community we live out these visions of what might be over and over.  We are enacting the new heaven and new earth, as we listen to and trust one another, as we welcome the strangers into our midst, care for our planet together, advocate for just public policies, collect food and dollars for people in need, gather our diverse community around The Lord’s table and potluck spreads.  We bravely welcome each others diverse perspectives and we consume each other’s homemade dishes.  We are always looking for new ways to love each other and include the outsider.  Trying again and again not to hinder God, with our eyes on these visions of of what might be.   A new heaven and a new earth!  And so we are called.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tOne typically figid December in Minnesota, my husband Chris and I had waited a little later than usual to get our Christmas tree.  Most of my life I have been living in or near cities, so I have spent a lot of time wandering around Christmas tree lots along busy streets.   When I was a little girl, our whole family would go to the lot and my brother and sisters and I would dart from tree to tree, debating which one was the most perfect.\\n\\tBut on that year when Chris and I went down to the local hardware store’s lot and looked around for a Christmas tree, we saw nothing.  Well, there were somethings, but they sure didn’t look like Christmas trees!  What was there was a forest of these odd, skinny banchy things.  They looked like tall, spiney, green carrots, narrow standing upright in their stands, and someone had taken off that twine that the trees come all wrapped in when they come stacked in big piles in trucks from the tree farms.  But the trees looked like they were still wrapped in twine.   Instead of the branches pointing horizontally, gracefully relaxed and like the tree looks out in the forest, these branches were all bunched together and pointing vertically, straight up!  So each tree looked like a skinny green carrot, branches all tight together.  When I got closer, I realized that not only were the branches sticking straight up, but the sap in them was frozen!   The branches couldn’t move!\\n\\tThe man in the hardware store said, come back in a day or so, when it is a bit warmer, and they will have opened up.\\n\\tSo we came back the next day, and it was only a few degrees warmer, and the trees still all looked like giant green carrots.  Scrawney, ugly, frozen.  By now, I realized that we were just going to have to buy one of these things and see what happened.   The man in the store reassured us, “oh the branches will relax, once you bring it inside.”  \\n\\n\\tChris and I wandered among the huge skinny green carrot trees, trying to imagine which one would be the fullest, if it ever relaxed its branches.  But who knew if they would relax?  We had to make a decision and take an action.   Finally I shut my eyes and just stood there, waiting to be directed to something I couldn’t even imagine.  I had to take a leap of faith, trust the promise of a stranger, and I imagine something – all evidence to the contrary.\\n\\tWe stuffed the tree in the back of our car and drove home.  I had my doubts about this.  We set the tree up in the living room, the tall skinny green carrot tree, and I headed to the kitchen to bake some Christmas cookies.  About a half an hour later Chris called out, “well, will you look at this!”  I came into the living room and saw that the branches had started to relax in the warmth of our home.  Within another 15 minutes the tree was open, full and beautiful.  \\n\\tSometimes it’s hard to see the promise right in front of us.  A frozen, skinny green carrot tree.   A helpless baby lying in a scrappy manger in a nowhere town born to nobody parents.   \\nSomeone inviting our forgiveness, or our participation in something new and challenging.  Something, deep in our hearts, urging us to change.  We hold back; we are unsure; we don’t commit; we want more evidence before we respond, before we take that leap into the unknown.\\n\\tWhat is the relaxed, sap flowing, green potential within and around us that may be difficult to perceive this Christmas time?  What are we unable to see or even imagine when we look out around our world?  Economic security?  Muslims who are not terrorists?  People of all religious faiths and no faith, listening to each other, learning about one another, living together in peace?  What is difficult to picture in your mind’s eye: An end to racial disparity and tensions in the Twin Cities?  What are you unable to see or imagine in your families this night?   Honest conversations, deeper understanding emerging, long-time grudges disappearing? \\n\\tSometimes I think we just want to stay out in the cold by ourselves.  Maybe we are stuck, frozen, in our stubbornness, our resentments, our self-righteousness.  But God waits for us in the least expected places, waiting to inspire those leaps of faith, drawing us back into the healing heat of God’s love.  God yearns to warm the sap of our spirits, to get us flowing again with self-acceptance and courage and hope.  Entering into our everyday world through the birth of Jesus, God invites us to relax our uptight selves and lower our defensive branches.  \\n“I am bringing you news of great joy,” says the angel.  “I am with you,” says God to all of us.  \\n“Come into the warmth of my love and my purposes,” says God this precious night.  “Let the movement of my Spirit animate and guide you.”  Such is the invitation.  Merry Christmas.  Amen.   \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe church calendar does an odd thing right before the Christmas rush begins.  The Sunday before Advent and Christmas season begin is considered the end of the church year.  The annual cycle of our Common Lectionary passages, which we and a wide variety of other Protestant and Catholic churches usually follow, always bring us back to Good Friday on this final Sunday.  With a strange, out-of-season jolt we are faced again with the narratives surrounding Jesus’ arrest, trial and torture, as Jesus is grilled by the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate.  We also re-visit the strange apocalyptic visions from the Hebrew scriptures Book of Daniel each year before Advent.  Fire, smoke, an Ancient One on a heavenly throne, the violent demise of mysterious beasts. Extraordinary metaphorical language representing the destruction of Israel’s enemies and the enthronement of God’s ultimate dominion.  Each year, right before baby Jesus is born again, our texts speak of the ultimate class between the powers of corrupt human empire and the dominion of God’s compassion and justice.  \\nAll of this apocalyptic focus on end times and confrontations between the powers can seem out-of-sync with the predominant concerns of our everyday lives.  Today, most of us are still basking in a turkey and stuffing glow, and shuffling through leftovers.  We are starting to wonder how to run the guanlett that is holiday shopping, busy weeks at church and related festivities that will unfold through December. All this talk about kingship and power, God’s reign and dominion, can seem a bit incongruent, even unsettling.    And don’t many of us find this question of “who is really in charge,” of our lives, to be difficult to answer?  How are we to understand what is the mysterious intertwining of human agency and God’s power in everyday life?  \\nTake this Thanksgiving focus on celebrating our blessings:  God’s good gifts of abundance are a huge theme this time of year.  But the reality of scarcity and unequal distribution is always with us, if we are am paying attention.  Our awareness and ache that this is so is the price of staying conscious on this plane.  It can also motivate us to be part of alievating disparity between those who have and those who do not.   But the contrast between is disturbing:  “yes God, thank you for these incredible blessings in my life,” and the next moment being overwhelmed by the needs of those who have so little.   I suspect that many of us at this time of year are also left wondering about the suffering, the seeming non-blessings people experience: the unexpected and incredible difficulties of peoples lives.  The unpredicatability, the fragility of our humanness.  “God, are you in charge of all this stuff?  And if you are, why is this world such a mess?”  \\nThe early first century Christians also lived in a time when God’s reign of hope, justice and healing did not appear to be prospering.  Yet it was during the repressive regime of Emperor Domitian that the author of the Book of Revelation rashly claimed that Jesus was the “Alpha and Omega,” the Greek letters that symbolized the “Beginning and the End,” the all of all that is.  This at a time when the early Christians in Rome were forced to call the Emperor “Lord and God” and worship his image in state temples.  To say Jesus Christ was “Lord and King,” to claim that God’s power pervades all, from our beginning to our end, was a dangerous, political act in that time. \\nIn this century, we are still wondering in what way God is powerful and bringing about the reign of justice and peace.  But on this day called “Christ the King Sunday,” we may be understandably nervous about claiming power language regarding God and Jesus.  We are haunted by 2000 years of Christians in power behaving badly, from forced baptisms to wholescale slaughter ofthose demeamed non-belivers.  And as Americans, we aren’t too keen on “king” or “kingdom” language, having fought to get away from a monarchy in the first place.  But these texts that speak of a curious kind of kingship challenges us to ponder the age-old question: “given this world’s beauty and its chaos – who is really in charge here?”  Put in Christian terms, “In what way is Jesus really Lord, King, Ruler of this world, of my life?”\\nAt the end of the liturgical year, right before Advent, our scripture texts bring this question into an arena where different powers are clashing.  The Book of Daniel appears as the Jewish people are struggling under the repressive Antiochus Epiphanes in 160’s BC.  To encourage them, Daniel writes of his dream of God as the “Ancient One” who destroys the four “beasts” (enemy nations of Babylon, Mede, Persia, Greece) and will send the Son of Man to have dominion over all.  We encounter metaphorical language that Jesus will later use about himself.  But how will he use this power? What an odd caricature of kingly power we will witness in Jesus’ humiliation, torture and eventual execution. \\n\\tJesus faces the mean spirited Pontius Pilate, Roman official who was particularly scornful of his Jewish subjects.  Pilate wants to pin Jesus down as either a criminal or a revolutionary, and repeatedly questions Jesus about his being a leader or “king” of the Jews.   “My kingship is not of this world,” Jesus replies.  And then he answers again, with a bit different twist, “my kingship is not from this world.”  Pilate is obviously perplexed, and then Jesus frustrates him further by saying: “for this I have come into the world…to bear witness to the truth.”  I can just see Pilate heaving a sign, perhaps staring out the window and asking rhetorically “…ahhh…what is truth?”  \\n\\tIn the GraecoRoman world, “truth” was something that one thought, an idea to be debated.  But in the Hebrew world “truth” carried a more embodied sense.  Truth was something you did or enacted in your life.  We have domesticated Jesus to such a point that it is hard to get a sense of the radical social upheaval he is talking about when he speaks of the “Kingdom of God”.  In the church we have often painted Jesus in pastel tones of meek, mild, ever-compassionate and loving; Jesus was here to enact something: a trust that human domination was not the last word.  Paradoxical ways of being in the world that would ultimately be more radical than overthrowing Caesar.  Enacting servanthood, nonviolence, being last, the least of these; ways of being that get us closer to God’s intention than amassing power. \\nPart of our challenge is to learn we enact this truth, to learn to trust that God is both our “beginning” and our “end,” of evidence to the contrary.  To learn to trust we are truly part of this unfolding reign of God’s transforming, healing power.  Enacting often means shifting my perspective. I have to consciously work my “trust” muscles in new ways.  One way to practice leaning into this truth, is to find ways to strengthen our trust muscles.   Try using pieces of this Celtic prayer we read in the Time of Centering.  Take it home and work with different phrases through this week.  Perhaps while standing in the grocery store wondering what can go in the basket given what is in the bank account.  “God to enfold me, God to surround me, God in my thinking.”  Frustrated words started to spill out of our mouth, hurting our child, our spouse our co-worker: “God in my lips, God in my heart.”  Or perhaps going to the doctors office and absorbing unexpected and frightening news:  “God in my hoping, God in my life.” Developing the trust that God is working with and through these present trials; exercising that assumption like an unused muscle.  God, through the Spirit of the Risen Christ, is our “beginning and our end.” We follow the One who helps us to see beyond appearances of both scarcity and abundance.   “God in my sufficing, God in my slumber, God in mine ever-living soul.”  We celebrate the sustaining presence that is our Alpha and Omega, our beginning and our end. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tHello, my name is Mark and I hail from Jerusalem, present day Israel where it is warm and dry!  This is quite amazing, here I am in the 21st century on the snowy north shore of Lake Superior.   You see, I lived during the 1st century, in the days of the early Jesus movement.  Back then, none of us thought much about the on-going-life-as-usual.  We were all so blown away that Jesus’ spirit was alive among us, and we shared everything that we had with each other and the fancy, rich folks even hung out with the low life and it was amazing….we thought about an End Times that was going to happen right away!  The Risen Jesus was coming back soon, and that the Kingdom of God and the overthrow of the Roman government was going to happen!  Whoa, I guess you can hear my urgency.  Maybe that’s why my Gospel is so short and written in the present tense, (unlike Luke and Matthew who sure do drag on and on!)  My community really thought God’s reign of justice and peace, as foretold by prophets like Isaiah, was right around the corner!  But wait, I’m getting ahead of myself a bit.   Let me properly introduce myself and tell you why I wrote my book about this amazing man Jesus.\\n\\tIt may be weird for you all to hear this, but back in my time we didn’t all share the same beliefs about Jesus. There was a lot of variety of opinion among us early Christians, and some tension between us, but somehow that didn’t stop our sense of unity in what we experienced as the spirit of the Risen Christ.  In fact, we sure were NOT in agreement about the birth of Jesus or even the importance of the birth stories!  Since I can see you are getting ready to celebrate his birthday on Christmas, let me just say that I didn’t really care much about where Jesus came from or who his parents or ancestors were.  The apostle Paul wrote earlier than me, and he apparently didn’t care either; he never mentions the birth stories in his letters. Neither does the Gospel writer John.  Matthew and Luke get into those birth stories BIG time, for their own reasons; but I’ll let them have their say the next few Sundays!   The big deal for me, and I put it right at the front of my gospel, is that Jesus was the “Son of God.”   To me that was the important part of his ancestry, that he came from God.  And…that his being the Son of God actually had some important implications for who WE are.   I’ll get to that part in a minute!\\n\\tAs an aside, I think you all have the right idea when you say you  “don’t take the Bible literally but take it seriously.”   I mean, look at me and Matthew and Luke and all the different things each of our Gospels say.  And John – holy cow, that guy is out on another planet with his wild symbolic language – Jesus as bread?  Jesus as the door?  Jesus as the light of the world?  Whoa!   \\n\\tOkay, back to me.  I started writing down some of the sayings about Jesus that came down through his disciple Peter, and other folks who knew him. Now please, understand this, I was NOT writing a biography of Jesus.  In fact, you are going to get really mixed up if you look at any of our four gospels as historical biography.  That doesn’t mean you won’t find history in them.  But they are written for another purpose; they are theological statements.   Each author giving his view of who Jesus was and what this means.   Like when Pastor Anne, if she is doing her job, reads the scriptures and pays attention to the current news and sees where it all connects in her sermons.  What was God doing in the past and what is the new thing God is doing in the world today?  We wrote our gospels so our different communities would understand how the Good News of Jesus connected with their specific time and place.   \\n Biblical scholars argue a lot about just who I was, and where and when I lived.  They DO agree I’m not the Mark who was one of Jesus disciples.  First of all I didn’t start writing down this stuff about Jesus until about 70 AD, so go figure.  Maybe I knew Jesus when I was a kid; some say I hung out with the apostle Peter and helped him with the Jerusalem Church.   It’s not really important, except for you to know that the destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem was a really big deal for my community.  A lot of us had Jewish parents or Jewish-Christian parents, and it was like having your ancestral home destroyed.  How could God let this happen, we asked ourselves?  Some of my community even wondered if God had let the Temple be destroyed because some of our Jewish brothers and sisters did not believe Jesus was the promised Messiah.  And there was also a lot of ongoing tension with those Roman troops who were still all over the place, and Emperor Nero thought it was really entertaining to arrest and torture those of us who claimed to be Jesus disciples.  \\n\\t. We were going through some hard times.  We even had to listen to the Emperors refer to themselves as “son of God.”  Sickening.  We really struggled in my community with the whole deal about suffering, when good people have bad things happening to them.  I wanted to encourage my folks, so first I introduced Jesus with his baptism, when God speaks and says that Jesus was God’s beloved son.  I think Jesus’ sense of purpose, his need to teach and heal people, didn’t really sink in for him until that moment. And here’s the wild part about his being the “son” of God.  Maybe this sounds scandalous to you but I think he was trying to remind ALL of us that as humans, we each are sons and daughters, beloved children of the living God.  On top of that bold claim, calling Jesus the “Son of God” was also a radical and dangerous political statement, given that the emperors were fond of calling themselves divine as Sons of God.  Everytime we called Jesus “son of God” we were reminding ourselves that the true ruler of the world was NOT the Roman emperor and his minions. \\n\\tI wrote my book because I wanted to encourage my people, and remind them that even scary, dangerous “wilderness” times can be filled with hope.  That’s probably why I started my gospel with this passage about John the Baptist that you read today.  I wanted everyone to know that the Good News that Jesus brought followed the prophecies of Hebrew scriptures, that Jesus was actually continuing the past.  The wilderness is where the Jews followed God through the Exodus from slavery in Egypt, the wilderness was where John the Baptist was preaching and encouraging people to repent, to turn their lives around and commit to God’s ways….and the wilderness is where Jesus went right after he was baptized by John and the Holy Spirit came down.   \\n\\tThe challenging, wilderness times in our lives can creep up gradually, like a chronic illness or an unraveling marriage.  We are still God’s precious sons and daughters.  The wilderness times can blast upon us like a winter storm, an unexpected disappointment, an unanticipated failure, a sharp miscommunication, a sudden accident or death.  In wilderness times we are stripped down to the basics of who and what we trust.  And we are still God’s beloved children.   I wanted my people to know that God, through the power of the Living Christ, was with them in their wilderness times; that God was bringing them together in sharing, in fellowship and praise, encouraging them, urging them on.   Maybe when you read my gospel, you will sense this too.  Good to talk with you about my book!  Prepare a way for God in your hearts this Advent season.  Because God comes among you, even now!   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe context for this curious parable in Luke story is a conversation Jesus is having with his close followers.  Jesus has just given everyone an earful with some rather ominous sounding apocalyptic predictions about the end times.  His friends are understandably unnerved, and so he speaks of prayer and tells them this cautionary story about a needy widow and a unjust judge.  Like any parable, the language is condensed and the meaning/meanings may be many.  This story appears to be about Jesus’ followers’ need “to pray always and not to lose heart,” says Luke as he introduces the story.  This idea of “praying always” echoes what we hear in the Apostle Paul’s letters to his young churches.  Does this mean one is to constantly be muttering certain prayers through the day?  Or did Jesus mean a certain stance in the present moment, maintaining an on-going awareness of God’s unseen, animating presence and guiding direction?  And what about “do not lose heart?” Is this just about losing courage?  The heart, and not the rational brain, was considered the seat of wisdom in the ancient world.  This organ of deep knowing was the way we humans might perceive the mystery of the unseen, of God and God’s realm on earth.  Was Jesus saying: don’t lose your connection to this seat of wisdom within you? \\nTo illustrate his point, Jesus proceeds to tell another parable.  But on first reading, this story about a wronged widow and an uncaring and resistant judge seems to imply if we pester God enough, we will get what we want.  Does this actually work?  It hasn’t been my experience that if I bug God long enough God gives me what I ask for.  And the more I think about this I realize I don’t believe “getting what I want” is why Jesus taught us to pray in the first place.  Talking about prayer is tricky; there are a lot of different views on prayer.  I suggest we It move “side-ways” for a moment, to stretch our perceptions and imaginations a bit.  Consider this additional story from an unknown author; a parable of two frogs and a bowl of cream:  \\nTwo frogs fell into a deep cream bowl;\\nThe one was wise, and a cheery soul.\\nThe other one took a gloomy view\\nAnd slipped beneath the surface, hopeless and blue.\\nSaid the other frog with a merry grin,\\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"\\nAnd as he swam, though ever it seemed,\\nHis struggling began to churn the cream\\nUntil on top of pure butter he stopped,\\nAnd out of the bowl he quickly hopped.\\nThe moral, you ask? Oh, it\\'s easily found!\\nIf you can\\'t get out, keep swimming around.  \\n(Author Unknown) \\u2028\\xa0\\nWhen we fall into a mess, don’t we just wish it was sweet cream!   The point of this silly cautionary tale, however, may be that the frog’s continual swimming causes something new to happen, and saves his neck.  Through his ongoing persistent actions, something changes in the cream bowl, in the environment around him.  He doesn’t just loose heart, give up, and blub-blub let himself drown.   Most young children understand the flow of this kind of story:  The hard-working ant contrasted with the lazy grasshopper in Aesop’s fables; the “little engine that could”  - “I think I can, I think I can” - who finally makes it up the huge hill.   And here, in Luke’s gospel today, the story of the feisty widow who keeps at it, persistently demanding that this unjust judge hear her case.   Something about our persistence changes things.  But what does it change?\\n“How much more will your just and loving God answer your prayers?” Jesus demands of his listeners.  He has told a contrast story, with almost absurd charactures:  vulnerable, powerless widow with no legal rights in her society, claiming that she will sock this judge in the eye (literal reading of “wear me out”) if he doesn’t hear her case.  A grumpy and arbitrary judge, who by Jewish law is specifically required to defend the rights of orphans and widows.  But the judge admits doesn’t even follow the two basic tenets of Jewish law: love God and treat your neighbor as you would yourself!  \\nIf we aren’t careful, we might equate God with the judge in the story.  Does God “need to be irritated before relenting” ? (William Loader, Uniting Church of Australia website, Pentecost 21).   Are we to pray and pray and pray, to keep bugging God about our needs, like a child might pester a reluctant parent. Like Bart and Lisa Simpson repeatedly asking, “please Dad, please Dad, please Dad.”?  Is it our job to somehow rattle God out of a stinginess, an aloofness, to get God’s attention?  I don’t know about you, but I’m not interested in a God who has to be persuaded and cajoled into helping humanity.  This image just doesn’t fit with the Biblical narrative of an attentive Creator God who sees the sparrow fall out of the tree and counts the hairs on our heads.  \\nPersistence in the practice of prayer is something more than pestering God about how we feel the world should be.  Returning to the tale about the two frogs who fell in the cream; it is the frog who keeps swimming, who keeps moving and engaging with the stuff around him, who finds his world changing.   I have found that daily conversation with God slowly changes both me and my perception of the spaces and people around me.  Situations seem to shift before my eyes.  Things often begin to look different.  What was slippery, treacherous cream slowly becomes firm butter and a way out of my mess.  There is something about our back and forth exchanges with God, as we express our thanks, our frustrations, our sadness, our anger, our wonderings, that begins to transform the world around us and begins to even change us.  \\nPerhaps this is the inner transformation we hear in this pilgrimage song of Psalm 121.  On a journey to the holy Temple in Jerusalem, the travelers look up to the hills before them.  Rugged terrain, bandits could be hiding, it all looks threatening!  But up into the steep hills they climb, wondering together about where help will come from.  Climbing, singing together, they recall their history as a sojourning people, who have known God’s help, this Holy One who has made the earth, the cosmos, which surrounds them.  As they see the treacherous path before them, they face their own sense of helplessness.  They sing back and forth as they steadily move upward, into the threatening place of little water, sharp crags, deep gullies and high peaks.  Their song is prayer: they sing gratitude for this God who does not sleep, who is with them always, as shade in the hot sun and preserver from evil.  We might wonder how is it that “a place of threat” can also be where help comes from?”  Threatening mountains become a place from which help will come. (Working Preacher site, 10/20/19). We stare that challenging situation or person or memory right in the face, we take heart.  We keep moving in spite of our fear, we keep naming God’s steady presence in our midst, we engage with persistence and hope.  Praying always in this way, we start to change.  \\nI think our challenge in the 21st century church is to build a supportive, encouraging, Biblically based faith community which is persistent in both prayer and scripture reading. Reading, meditating upon, soaking in God’s word becomes part of a dialogue between us, our Biblical ancestors and the Holy Spirit moving in our midst.  This is the foundation that makes our outreach and mission work possible and effective.  And persistent prayer and scripture soaking can soften our hearts, help us become more loving and forgiving.  It can help us decide which of the overwhelming social action needs we should address together.   \\nHow might we, during this transitional period, begin to explore new ways to be together in prayer, be it in church meetings or fellowship groups?  How might we experiment with different opportunities to soak in the scriptures together?  I would love to hear your thoughts on this. \\nI have experienced that the ongoing action, the “swimming” in the practices of prayer and scripture reading, can transform us and better equip us for service in this world.  The frog in the cream was “wise and had a cheery soul,” in part because he kept swimming. \\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"  \\nAnd in the midst of our prayerful persistence, and through our acts of healing and kindness, the world around us is changed.  Butter starts to form where there once was cream, and all kinds of new possibilities emerge!  Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWHO IS THIS JESUS?\\n\\n\\tBacked up traffic on the New Jersey turnpike; not the best way to end a week’s vacation in New England, and there we were.  But wait, my new map app to the rescue!  I was being offered another route that purportedly would save us over an hour!  So, my husband Chris and I happily ditched the interstate highway for two lane roads through small towns, fields and forests.  And that’s when I saw the homemade sign placed on the front lawn of a modest home in the middle of what felt like nowhere.  Bright yellow with black letters, it read:  “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the way of salvation.”  I did a quick double take to make sure I got it right; not “believe in” but “believe ON” read the sign.   I generally find such theological proclamations to be mildly assaultive and easily dismissable, especially statements that tell me do do something and that include the buzz word “salvation.”  “Don’t tell me how to get saved, or that I need to be saved,” I will mutter to myself.  But something kept tugging at me as I watched the small town sail by us:  believe ON.  Like, “lean on,” I thought to myself as I returned to my ever-shifting, constantly updating map app.  “Lean on, trust in.”  There was some movement called for in the roadside proclamation and it wasn’t cognitive engagement about a doctrinal proposition.  “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the way of salvation.”  \\n\\tI thought of today’s text from Matthew that we would consider together in worship.  This story follows increasingly tense interactions between Jesus and local religious leaders about the correct interpretation of Torah, Biblical law and custom.  The disciples have observed all of this and are increasingly nervous about Jesus’ and their own safety.  Perhaps Jesus can sense their concern, and turns to address it point blank.  “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”  It’s a title arising out of the Jewish apolcalytic literature, such as the Book of Daniel, which speaks to a human one who will come in the end times to usher in God’s realm of mercy, justice and peace.   I can just see the disciples nervously scrambling for an answer:” uh, some say John the Baptist, others say one of the prophets like Elijah or Jeremiah.”  Studiously avoiding what they themselves might think or say.  “But who do you say that I am?”  Jesus asks them.\\n\\n\\t“Who do we say that Jesus is?”  Throughout Christian history,  there has been controversy, heresy trials, schisms and even violence resulting from this question.   So often, the focus has become: do you have the correct answer, the special password, the right key to get into to heaven, avoid the inquistor’s torture or join a particular church.  Here at Emmaus United Church of Christ, we worship within in a faith community that has no doctrinal test.  “Many paths, traveling together,” as the first part of your vision statement declares.  However, as Emmaus United Church of Christ, I would say you are united in your intention to follow the teachings and the Spirit of Jesus of Nazareth.  But exactly who is this Jesus?  Some congregations cope with their theological diversity by practicing an unspoken rule of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” in fear that some may feel judged or excluded if they really start asking each other point blank:   “Who is this Jesus for YOU?” I have found that honest and non-judgemental conversations about what we belief ON, what we lean on, what we trust in, developes intimacy between people.  These explorations can invite us more deeply into the mystery of God’s intentions and our own understandings can shift and expand.  All of this conversation has, dare I say, a grace-filled and even salvific affect on us as individuals and as a community.  “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the way of salvation,” proclaimed the sign.   \\t\\n\\tThis conversation between Jesus and his disciples, described in Matthew, happens on a larger stage of ancient stories and shared salvation history.  The Bible claims that God wants to save people from the mess they keep making of God’s beautiful gift of the world and of human life.  A foundational salvation story begins in our Hebrew text for today, the Exodus story. This is a common Biblical theme of unlikely and not powerful people enabling God to make huge changes.  The Israelites had moved from being welcomed members of Egyptian society to now serving as slaves under a new Pharaoh who did not know Joseph or his historical lineage back to the founders of the Israelite people, Abraham and Sarah.  In this story set in a patriarchal society, God uses a brave mother, a defiant midwife, young sister Miriam, Pharaoh’s daughter and willing servants, to fly under the radar of those in power, and to subvert Pharaoh’s murderous plan to decimate the Jews by killing their infant sons.  \\n\\tThis ancient tale was known and treasured by any faithful first century Jew steeped in his or her native religious tradition, which would include Jesus and most of those he interacted with.   It spoke to a specific human problem: captivity and a people in danger.  It calls forth a specific divine answer: God’s work of salvation through liberation.  The Biblical scholar and theologian Marcus Borg describes the Exodus story as one of the three Big Stories “at the heart of Scripture that shape the Bible as a whole” …Each of these stories images the religious life in a particular way.” (Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, p. 122).  He writes that “two of the stories are grounded in the history of ancient Israel: the story of the exodus from Egypt, and the later story of the exile and return from Babylon.  The third, a still later story, is the priestly story; it is grounded not in the history of ancient Israel but in (their) evolving religious institution – namely, the temple, priesthood, and (blood) sacrifice.  This last part feels foreign to us as Christians, but it shaped how early Christians understood who Jesus was.  The three salvation stories, of liberation, of return from exile, and of ritual cleansing  are the three central stories of the Hebrew Bible our Old Testament, (proposes Borg) they shaped the religious imagination and understanding of both ancient Israel and the early Christian movement.”   It is these three stories that help inform my sense of who Jesus is by the different types of “saving” he offers in his ministry with people.  \\n\\tEach of these three identity-shaping stories describe a problem in the human condition and prescribe a solution to that problem: captivity needs liberation, exile needs homecoming and sinfulness needs forgiveness.   Do people need different types of salvation?  I think we might.  And I am NOT speaking of being saved from hell after we die!  I think much of our personal identity is intertwined with those shadow parts of our lives, our places of wounding and struggle, and our on-going search for healing.  Perhaps we each might wonder:  where have I been wounded the most deeply?  Or, where do I struggle the most in life?  How might God heal, or save me, or is it my job to do this all by myself?  \\n\\tProbably few of us here would describe ourselves as enslaved or in physical bondage, although much of the world is enslaved by extreme poverty, racism, homophobia, sexism or political oppression.  But the Exodus from slavery in Egypt story may speak to us, as we are bound up by compulsive behavior.  Are there unhealthy habits or even full-blown addiction from which we yearn to make an “exodus” and be saved?  \\n\\tOr, we relate more closely with the sense of distance and alienation described by the Jewish experience in exile.  In our transient society, many Americans identify this feeling of alienation, of being exiled from a beloved community, or experience a sense of separateness even within our own families.  We yearn for the “exile” to end, to be replaced with the saving grace of a fuller sense of connection with others.  And for some of us, there may be a deep sense of wrong, even a feeling being unclean or sinful, within us.  Perhaps it was something egregious we did, or a sense of being fouled by the shaming or brutalizing behavior of someone else.  We may yearn for the cleansing salvation of forgiveness, so we can feel new and whole.  Could it be that humans need God’s salvation in different ways?\\nI understand the answer to “who is Jesus?”, to be related to these three human needs. Jesus, as described throughout the New Testament, spoke to these different human problems: of enslavement to people and things, of exile and alienation, and of an inner sense of defilement, guilt and sinfulness.   Early Christians understood Jesus as the answer to each of these human needs that were depicted in the Biblical narratives of the Jewish people.  Needs that any human might experiences at some point his or her life.   \\n\\tMarcus Borg is controversial in Christian circles, in part because he says that the Christian church, particularly through St. Paul’s writings, focuses too much on the third human problem of sinfulness.  We have come to see Jesus primarily through the lens of the priestly concern for purity and “making us right with God by offering sacrifice on our behalf” (Borg, p. 127).  Purity; Jesus as the answer to human guilt.   But what if you don’t feel particularly sinful or guilty or stained?  Thank goodness the Biblical texts offer us a wider perspective of different ways of being saved.    \\n\\tThis week, let’s continue to ponder Jesus’ question,  “who do you say that I am?”  Do I need to be released or unbound?  Connected and reunited?  Cleansed and made whole?  What would it mean for each of us to “believe on” this Jesus for the salvation that we each need?  For the gift and the ongoing challenge of Jesus’ question, I give thanks.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nWe don’t know the actual context in which Jesus taught his followers the Lord’s Prayer.  They may well have been in the middle of eating together: a relaxed evening meal or a hastily consumed mid-day snack as they walked from one town to the next.  Maybe Jesus held up a piece of flat bread, still common fare in the middle east today, and said: Give us this day our daily bread. What kind of “bread” do you picture in your mind’s eye as you hear this petition?  When I pray this part of the Lord’s Prayer, I remember the squishy white sliced marvel of my childhood: Wonder Bread!  My sister and I loved to tear off the crust and mush it into a ball, which we would slowly nibble as we wandered the neighborhood.  Give us this day our daily bread.  \\nFood is so over-consumed in our part of the world that we live in culture of fad diets, rising obesity and diet-related diabetes.   And some popular diets suggest that bread is fattening and bad for us.   Perhaps we should pray “keep us away from our daily bread!”   We know all too well that as many of us walk miles to burn off calories from bread, others around the world walk miles to just find bread and food calories for their families. \\n\\nThe whole issue of daily sustenance, and our relationship with food, has become increasingly complicated:  we may drool over the Wednesday Food section in the Post, pour through glossy food magazines, watch hours of TV celebrity chef shows of other people cooking, obsess about nutritional value and the sourcing of our food, but as a nation we spend less and less time cooking.  Too much processed food, fast food, junk food.  The powers and reach of agri-business, industrialized feedlots, and GMO’s continue to grow, and overwhelm our supermarket aisles. All while we are painfully, if we can stand to pay attention, painfully aware of the exploding number of people in the world who are hungry.  Over 800 million a day, with about 35,000 dying daily from hunger related illnesses. Give us this day our daily bread. How do we hear those words, some 2000 years after Jesus spoke them to his followers?   How does God envision that we relate to our need for daily sustenance?\\n\\nAs we looked at the first part of this prayer, I suggested we imagine “God the Father”, as the Divine Head of the World Household. As a just and merciful Householder, head a multigenerational estate.  God looking after God’s whole house, seeing that everyone, even the most vulnerable, get enough.  May your kingdom, your reign of peace and justice, come.  We considered how we are called to be co-workers, partners in helping heal the broken House of God’s world.  Today’s brief petition about daily bread moves us into the nitty-gritty of how life should go in God’s House of the World.  And it is not just about me as an individual:  not, give me my daily bread.  Maybe that would be the first piece God intends:  we see ourselves in this need for sustenance together. As the paraphrase by John Philip Newell that we just prayed says: “May there be food for the human family today and for the whole earth community.”  If you don’t have food, this should be a problem for me.   \\n\\nBut it is a huge challenge to maintain this awareness on a daily basis, to bring it to the consciousness of our children, to find ways to be around and work with and for hungry people.  I’m beginning to think this is one of the most challenging spiritual practices there is today:  what might I do daily that addresses world hunger, near and far?  Might I pray about this a few times a day?  Pick a country with food shortages and read about it, make a donation on a website, talk with my family about it? Find a food policy issue that worries me and pepper my congress people with letters about it?  Help my children to choose 5 items for the local food pantry each time we shop together and deliver it?  Really put a few more moments of attention to slow and careful table blessings said together at each meal? Grow some food – anything; cook some food mindfully?  A daily spiritual practice of engaging our daily bread more fully.\\n\\n\\tJesus’ disciples would have heard this part of the prayer as they chaffed against the control of the Roman Empire, where the life for many within the Jewish community was precarious at best. People were conscripted for military duty, lost their land and were dealt taxes and tariffs on most aspects of their lives.  This also included the local fishing industry, which was of particular concern to many of those meeting Jesus.  Rome made commercial dealings more profitable for those in power, but far less so for everyone else, like the local fishermen.  The fish you caught were taxed, as was your boat and your nets, and the materials used to repair your nets and vessel. \\n\\n\\tSo, the context for Jesus’ prayer is a tinderbox.  But what is so incendiary about: “Give us this day our daily bread?”  These worlds would resonate with the Exodus story for his Jewish followers: Their ancestors had fled slavery in Egypt, and struggled with starvation during their years of traveling through the wilderness on the way to the Promised Land.  But they were blessed with the appearance of manna, a substance that would last for about a day before spoiling, with which they could make bread.  Enough was provided just for that day.  Jesus’ prayer would seem to make a tidy circle.  Just pray for this day….don’t get greedy.  Simple enough.\\n\\t\\n\\tNot so simple and innocent, writes the New Testament scholar, John Dominic Crossan.  Crossan contends that this part of the prayer about daily bread may be the most dangerous part of Jesus teaching.  “Jesus dies not for demanding charity or generosity of hospitality,” says Crossan.  “(Jesus will be killed) because he insists the world and its food belong to God and not Rome.”   Over and over, Jesus would use both bread and fish to illustrate this reality: He would multiplying not just wine, but loaves and fishes, politically dangerous acts where the Romans are standing by ready to tax all any extra food production!   Jesus spoke of himself as “the bread of life,” blessed and broke bread as symbolic of his own body and spirit that will nourish his followers. The resurrected Jesus stood on the beach directing his followers where to productively fish, then grilled them fish for breakfast.  In front of everyone, Jesus kept enacting a living parable of God as Householder of the world: The Emperor of Rome is not ultimately in charge here; God is. \\n\\t\\n\\tI wander the aisle of the supermarket and wonder to myself: what do we need, what is enough?   We are currently consuming large quantities of seasonal blueberries at my house.  Hmmm…”New Jersey blueberries” I read on the plastic box.  Wonder what it’s like to pick these things?  My few minutes on the Internet reveals that there are ongoing labor violations in the NJ blueberry industry. Haitian migrant workers come up from FL, enduring overcrowded and unsanitary labor camps, unsafe bus transportation.  This, according to the Farmworkers Ministry of the Diocese of Camden, a group concerned enough to have established a social justice ministry among these farmworkers.  Not in my backyard?  Well, I’m eating the blueberries they pick, aren’t I?\\n\\n\\t God the Householder of the World wants food security, enough bread and fish, for everyone. If your child is starving, you become insecure, angry and desperate.  We read of how the price of bread in Syria has increased 6-fold in the current struggle of civil war.  And how people in northern Virginia, across the river in the District, around our country this summer, are having to make the choice between paying a utility bill or buying groceries.  Between paying for medicine or paying for bread.  And as hard as it is for us to imagine, many of these people are already working several jobs. \\n\\t\\n\\tMaybe it’s our own anxiety about our own future that complicates our relationship with food.  God is ready to partner with us, to guide and empower us and our choices, and we stay stand-of-ish.  We stay muddled in our own worries and insistence that we figure this out ourselves.  Perhaps we might try a new rhythm – deepened enjoyment and appreciation for the variety and amount of food available for us each day, taste and texture meant to please us.  Perhaps some more mindful tasting, savoring it – the bread this day.  And as part of this rhythm, then learning more about who is hungry and why. Talking with our children about this, finding the places on the map, deciding together what the small part is that we will learn and do together. Participating in our food drives here at church, packing dry food together this Fall in our annual “Stop Hunger Now” project.  I was glad to have a chance to talk with one of our youth just this morning, as she described volunteering a full day yesterday at “Alive” in Alexandria, an organization which distributes food to hungry families.  She plans to continue this volunteer work in the fall.  What about the rest of us?  How might we get out and about as a congregation, like Deena has just started doing, into communities that are hungry, homeless shelters and feeding centers, so we might learn from them.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWhat will be the new spiritual practices we will engage around food and food justice?  Pray like this, said Jesus:  “May there be food for the human family today and for the whole earth community….give us this day our daily bread.”  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tYears ago, someone in one of my congregations approached me near the beginning of Lent with a question:  Somewhat sheepishly, this person asked:  “Why is Jesus going to Jerusalem to die already?  Wasn’t he just born a few months ago?”  As we follow the Common Lectionary of scripture readings, we cycle through birth, death and resurrection of Jesus in a manner of months.  This is in part because early church officials incorporated what they believed to be competing, pre-Christian seasonal pagan festivals into the Christian year.  Winter solstice celebrations were reshaped and sanctified to celebrate the birth of the Son of God.  Jesus’ death occurred during the Jewish feast of Passover celebrating their escape from the typrany of Egypt.  Ancient spring festivals of rescue, release and new life from various traditions linked naturally with the Christian resurrection stories.   \\nBut I think our natural resistence to change, decline, loss, and death makes it difficult to follow Jesus in the final weeks of his life.  It  seems like Jesus is just getting started in his ministry of teaching and healing, and the shadows appear. He heads for Jerusalem and the story shifts to growing opposition, and numberous references to his impending suffering.  The disciples are mystified and understandably concerned about him, and begin to wonder about their own safety.  Jerusalem: the huge metropolis that is home to the magnificent rebuildt Temple, the Holy of Holies, the center of their liturgical and spiritual universe. For the Jewish people, this is where the heart of God beats.  But in the first century, it is now a city under the crush of Roman domination.  The Jewish leaders are understandably wary of suspicious crowd gatherings and rabble rousers who preach political messages like “the Kingdom of God is at hand.” \\nWhat do we learn about this God whose kingdom, reign, is supposedly “at hand?”  The sacred texts of Jesus, the Jewish Torah, brings us this curious passage from Genesis.  Here God promises the childless patriarch Abraham both descendents and a future land for his people.  And God seals this interaction, this new covenant, with Abraham with an action that may seem quite primitive and distasteful to us: an animal sacrifice.  If we can hold our natural repulision at bay for a moment, we notice God affirming God’s promise with a familiar curse:  I remember as a child using something similar in making a promise:  “cross my heart and hope to die.”  This is an ancient oath, or even self-curse, used in establishing a promise agreement, a covenant between two parties.  Here, God uses the image passing between cut up pieces of animals.  Abraham is in a deep sleep envisioning this; God is the initiator and with this symbolic act of passing a “smoking fire pot and a flaming torch between these animal pieces,” says to Abraham:  I risk myself to you so you will know these promises are true.  May I be torn apart like these animals pieces if I don’t hold up my end of this covenant.  “Cross my heart and hope to die?”  This is God taking the risk of relationship, being vulnerable.  \\nThe minute Jesus starts lining out the radical inclusiveness of God’s Kingdom in his teachings and public interactions with people, he begins challenging those whose power is based on exclusivity and privilege.  And this kind of preaching makes him immediately vulnerable to the fears and power hunger of the authorities.  In today’s text from Luke, news reaches Jesus that Herod sees him to be some kind of troublesome successor to John the Baptist.  Herod is one of those small-time, put-upon and frustrated middle-management rulers, caught between the Roman higher-ups and the worried Jewish leaders and the unpredictable rabble of his fellow Jews below him.  Herod longs to lead his people into a time of security and affluence, a renewed glory for Jerusalem, all centered on Empire values of dominance and wealth.  He knows Jesus is preaching unsettling views about “the last being first, and the first being last,” empowering marginalized people to stand up for a place at the society’s table, for acceptance and justice.   And Jesus will not mollify Herod.  To the Pharisees, who try to warn him, Jesus seethes:  “Herod thinks he is powerful?  You go tell that fox about real power, about God using me to cast out demons and to heal people.  Herod has no viable power over me and the ministry I am unleashing.”  I can just see the disciples cringing as they hear this; “please Jesus, just cool it or we will all be in trouble.”  \\nI too find myself somewhat unsettled by the fierceness of Jesus’ tone.   There is tension and judgment here, where I might want him to talk in more even and reassuring tones.  But Jesus never hesitates to call us to certain standards we are held accountable to, even as we speak of God’s mercy and forgiveness.  He will call people out of the safety of their lives into new life.  He will heal someone along the way, then looks that person in the eye and says, “go and sin no more.”  This quiet fierceness will noisily erupt in him occasionally; he will angrily flip over the tables of the moneychangers in the temple courtyards, he will call certain religious leaders “hypocrites.”  \\nIt’s been a long time since I read C.S. Lewis’ The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and I have come at this point in my life to see some of Lewis’ allegories of story of salvation to be both violent and simplistic.  I was reminded, however, in something I read this week of that scene where the children in Lewis’ story first learn about the lion Aslan.  These British children separated from their family through war, have pushed through the back of a closet, a wardrobe while playing hide and seek, only to tumble into a bizarre, mythical realm filled with curious creatures and talking animals.  They meet a huge lion called Aslan, who serves as a somewhat terrifying Christ figure in the story.  The children are naturally afraid of him.   Lucy, the youngest inquires as to whether or not Aslan is “safe.”  “Who said anything about safe?” replies one of the other talking animals in the story.  “Of course he isn’t safe.  But he is good.”  Not safe, but good.\\nAbraham and his wife Sarah’s story will be one of learning about God’s goodness; God’s demandingness, God’s care, God’s vulnerability with humans.  Jesus knew this in his gut; God is ultimately good, and the life of following God is not necessarily safe.  We live on a planet that is constantly shifting and changing, and consequently endangering us.  It appears to be human nature that we both succeed and fail, to do great good and to sin horribly.  None of this makes us “safe.” \\nThis reality must have grieved Jesus.  “Jerusalem, Jerusalem,”  he moaned, “you kill your prophets who challenge your way of life.”  The Hebrew prophets centuries before had also challenged those in political and religious power in Jerusalem.  “Just because God’s presence is in this magnificent, holy temple,” they would rail, “just because we have this glorious Davidic monarchy, this is not some kind final fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham of descendents and a nation!”  “Jerusalem,” the prophets would cry, “you with your oppressive acquisitiveness that is the anxious urban style, how little you know of God’s new agenda for you, one of compassion and neighborliness and justice.”  \\nTemembering God’s fierce denouncement and tender love for this holy city through the years, Jesus is overcome with sadness and compassion.  He knows that only some of its inhabitants will hear and embrace his message.  He knows that confronting the powers that be in that city will be dangerous. “Would that I could gather you in like a mother hen gathers her brood under her wing,” he sighs.  The vulnerability of this image is itself disconcerting, as a hen has no talons, and very little beak, with which to ward off attackers like a sly fox.  The hen only has her wings, the weight of her body and ruffled feathers to press sacrificially against her chicks, and even then they often scatter and run beyond her reach in their panic.  Ultimately hen has only herself to offer in sacrifice to the fox, as a way to cover for her escaping chicks.\\nThrough Lent, we will find that Jesus is pressing ahead of us, moving into uncertain terrain.  He will be certain of this God who is ever with him, both tender and fierce.  And we are called to follow after him, navigating this unpredictable and unsafe life.  Knowing we too are gathered in and accompanied.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tJesus had a knack for describing things sideways:  he would draw word pictures for people, in order to explain truths that may not seem obvious. 'The Kingdom, the reign of God is at hand!' he would say. People would look around and see the Roman legions imposing control over their communities; they would see the rich getting richer and the lower classes struggling, and would wonder 'what is he talking about?' To help people understand the reality God's liberating and healing activity in their midst, Jesus would reply with an everyday image in an everyday story: The Kingdom of God is like….well, it's like soil and seeds and farming and growing!  His audiences were mostly workers of the land, closely familiar with the ways of an agrarian society.  But listening to Jesus' stories about soil and seeds this week and last week, one might conclude that God is one strange farmer!  And if this God's kingdom is at hand, should we be worried?  Last week we had this image of God extravagantly strewing seeds all over the place; thin soil, soil with lots of birds, rocky soil, soil filled with thorns, and oh yes, rather haphazardly also onto rich good soil.  This week we have this curious story of God allowing weeds to be planted in someone's wheat field, and then we're told that's okay, God will sort it out in the end!  Farming, or even small-time gardening, is not exactly my forte, but even I know this is not how one produces high-yield crops!\\n\\tWhen we are perplexed by a scripture passage, a good place to start is by asking ourselves: How would Jesus' listeners hear these words?  What were the everyday realities, the context, of their lives?  Many of them probably were farmers, mostly laborers and not estate owners, others were fishermen, others craftsmen, merchants, and some were just dirt poor and jobless.  But they were also Jews, steeped in the stories, traditions and culture of the Hebrew Bible and Temple worship.  And they were under the oppressive thumb of the occupying Roman rule.  They would hear today's parable and find it quite perplexing.  First of all, Jesus' listeners would know that there were Roman laws against sowing darnel, or wheat-looking weeds, in someone's field.  They would remember the passage in the Hebrew Bible, in Leviticus, which states that planting weeds in a field turns the whole field into something that is ritually impure, that even gathering up the weeds can't change.  Eat the wheat from this field, and you will be impure or unclean and cannot participate in Temple worship.  \\nThe other context for Jesus' original audience is that not everyone is following Jesus.  Jesus is continuing to get in trouble with the religious leaders and is coming to the attention of community leaders as a trouble maker.  Believers and non-believers are starting to rub up against each other, in neighborhoods, in the synagogues, within families.  Wheat and weeds in the same field, you might say.  How could God be present in this situation, if all these unbelievers and no-goods were allowed to co-exist with believers and righteous people?  Upon hearing this parable, Jesus' listeners are really going to wonder just why the owner wants to leave all the weeds there.\\n\\tLike any good parable, the story is going to get under the listeners skins a bit and even irritate them.  Here's the part that irritates, stirs me up when I listen closely to the parable.  In the Kingdom of God, wheat and weeds are permitted to grow together, and God sorts it out at the end.  First of all, I would much prefer to think of myself as the wheat of this story: I'm fruitful in my labors and growing something helpful for Gods Kingdom.  I'm no slouch, I'm no WEED.  But Jesus seems to be saying that life is full of wheat and weeds all mixed together.  Apparantly the fact that this is an imperfect world, with good and bad existing side-by-side, is part of God's plan.   But what about those of us who are dutiful and faithful and show-up when there is work to be done?\\n\\tDoes this ever bug you? Saints and sinners, all mixed together and all seeming to receive God's blessing of rain and sunshine. The local church is a great example of this reality.  What a mixed field of plants we are in the church!  Nay-sayers and negative types, mixed in with the yeah-sayers and the positive types.  Folks who faithfully come to worship every Sunday and never seem to drop the ball, and others who claim connections to the congregation but don't even recognize the current balls we have in the air!  In most churches I have served, there are always people who approach any new idea with suspicion, and there are people who are eager to try anything new.  And then, to really confuse things, sometimes people change on us!  Wheat become weeds and weeds become wheat, as it were!  Who is good?  Who is bad?  Who is faithful and righteous?  Who is not?  It's enough to drive a hard-working person batty!  Leave the judgement to God, Jesus seems to say.   Leave the judgement to God…and by the way, God doesn't seem big on purity.\\n\\tGod is strange in this way; God doesn't seem really picky; God will work with just about anyone.   Take today's story from Genesis for today.  Abraham's grandson, Jacob, was of questionble character, a real 'weed' if we think about it.  Part of it was his mother Rebekah's fault; she talked Jacob into this contrived scheme to steal his older brother Esau's birthright.  But Jacob basically was a wiley trickster and a cheat.  The amazing part of this story is that after Jacob has lied and fooled his father, in a culture where one is to honor one's parents, he ends up receiving God's blessing!  He has this strange vision in his sleep of angelic divine messengers traipsing up and down between heaven and earth, and God suddenly appearing right next to him!  ''Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.''  Land, descendents, the blessing of protective presence.  Wow.  After he cheated his brother and lied to his dad?   Is it little wonder Jacob wakes up from this dream and exclaims, ''surely the LORD is in this place – and I did not know it!''\\t\\n\\tSometimes in the middle of our human condition, work, families, this church, filled with wheat and weeds all mixed together, we wonder if God is here at all.  Isn't God big on sorting out the good from the bad and sending the evil ones off to firey damnation? But in the Kingdom of God, says Jesus, the good mixes with the bad.  This tends to annoy those of us who pride ourselves on our hard, diligent work, like the religious leaders of Jesus' time, and most folks who help make today's churches run.  But Jesus says the Kingdom of God is like this field, filled with both wheat and weeds.  I think Jesus was challenging those of us who believe people should be excluded because they were not ''wheat-like'' in the way we think they should be.  This is often a problem for churches as they start to really reach out to the unchurched, and new people who are different from the current membership start coming in the door. \\n\\tGod worked God's purposes through some pretty questionable characters throughout Biblical history, and seems to still do that today.  Jesus reminds us that while the arrival of God's good future is assured, the way from here to there is strewn with people making mistakes, with sin and unbelief.   So we might notice this week when we find ourselves making distinctions between good and bad people, when judgementalism creeps into our tone. This is the Good, but perhaps unsettling, News for today; the wheat and the weeds are mixed together for now, and it’s our job to live together peacefully and productively.  God is going to sort it all out in the end.   Meanwhile, we get on with our work together in this imperfect world, grateful once again for God’s guiding and protective presence.   Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Today’s story is time number three, as the group heads towards Jerusalem and Jesus’ confrontation with the authorities.  Jesus has just said, again, that the Son of Man will be handed over to religious and political authorities, mocked, spit upon, flogged, killed and in three days will rise again.  Here now, how his followers respond:\\n\\n\\nJESUS’ UPSIDE DOWN WORLD\\n\\n\\tWell, what would you say if a beloved teacher and leader kept talking about his immanent arrest and execution?  Shocking news from someone we love seems to illicit one of two responses:  we either rise up in dispute, “no way, your’re wrong, we can’t let that happen!” or we space out, we dissaociate, almost pretending like the comment never happened.  “James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to Jesus and said to him: “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”  What?  This cannot end well.  Do you remember when King Herod was so turned on by Salome’s dancing that he promised her whatever she asked of him?  And that certainly didn’t end well, what with John the Baptist’s severed head on a platter!  The disciples have completely ignored what Jesus has just said about his suffering and death.  I am reminded of the story I once heard about a man whose car was struck by lightening as he drove home in a storm one night.  He survived, but it was an absolutely terrifying experience.  Arriving home, he stumbles into his house in shock and begins to describe his horrifying ordeal to his family.  But his teenage son interrupts him and exclaims, “Dad, let’s go buy a lottery ticket.  They say the chances of being hit by lightning are like the chances of winning the lottery!”   (Feasting on the Word, Year B, Volume 4, p. 188, David B. Howell).  I guess sometimes we are just so self-absorbed, we are unable to see or hear what is right in front of us.\\n\\tSo what is up with these two disciples, James and John?  Their request sounds strange to us, but they seem to be yearning and even scheming for some kind of priviledged position.  Jesus, here so very patient and compassionate in the face of this odd request to do whatever they ask, simply replies, “well what do you want me to do for you?”  I can see one of these guys smiling smugly and saying, Jesus, when you are in your glory, after you die and are resurrected, we want to be near you, in fact James here wants to sit on your right hand and I want to sit on your left hand!”  The other disciples eyes go wide in surprise, and understandable annoyance.  But haven’t we each had our James-and-John-moments?  Times when we plan and plot for more priviledged postions in our community, at work, in our families?  This even happens in churches when someone announces: “I want you to do for me whatever I ask of you….or I just might withhold my offerings or go and find another church.”  But mostly we do this striving and positioning quietly…or put another way, “we want a lot of things that we never admit out loud.” (IBID, David Howell, p. 190) \\n\\tSo when James and John, some of first people to start following Jesus, ask their question, we do well to remember how we each have yearned for preferential treatment at times.  This urge can be very subtle and we have to watch for it like a hawk.  Just yesterday I was attending a church workshop held in the congregation where my family had attended while I was in high school.  This is now a big, flagship church in our Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ and they have a new woman pastor.  As we were touring the sanctuary at the lunch break, I found myself saying to the pastor:  oh, gracious, I haven’t been in this building since I came back in the late ‘80’s to co-officiate with the then current pastor at my sister’s wedding!  Was I saying this to make an interesting point of connection with my continuity with this church, or to establish my position as a co-professional with this other pastor?  In what way did my comment shift the focus from the beautiful sanctuary, the pastor’s current ministry there, and shift it to wonderful me?  Hmmmm…..see what I mean?  We all need to watch out for the ways in which self-promotion and priviledge seeking seeps into our lives, and we need to confess it and let God heal our self-absorption.  \\n\\tJesus knows it is nearly impossible for his contemporaries to hear the real news about the Kingdom of God.  Why?  Because we are so darn self-absorbed and self-promoting!  We think this is what will make us safe and secure.  But God does not appear to be overly concerned with our constant need to feel safe and secure; God has other plans for us.  Jesus arrives and continues to unfold the Biblical vision of healing and transformation of the world, starting with each of us.  Starting with basically an upheaval of how we think things should work.  Like, I need a position of importance and priviledge to feel safe and secure in this world!  Jesus talks about how the Gentile (non-Jewish) leaders rule the community by “lording over them” and being tyrants.  “But it is not so among you;” continues Jesus, “whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave to all.”\\n\\tSo here it is, for the third time as the Gospel of Mark describes it.  Jesus talks about his own suffering, his servanthood on behalf of all of us, the disciples don’t get it, and Jesus describes how following him means being a giver, a server, not a receiver, not a served.  Jesus turns the disciples expectations upside-down.  The first shall be last, the last shall be first.  Whoever wishes to be first must be a server, a slave to all.  The Kingdom of God, God’s realm on this earth, is about serving, caring for, healing, transforming this hurting world.  Get on board, Jesus is telling his disciples.  \\n\\tThe workshop I attended yesterday focused on strengthening the ministries of the local church in two ways.  By getting clear and up-to-date in our describing of what we offer a spiritually hungry community.  By helping our congregations become more generous in their giving as a way of growing spiritually themselves.  Marketing and money!   One of the images that sticks in my mind was that of two contrasting pictures on the video-screen in front of us.   Two adults sitting in a pew in church.  One adult with a bib tied around his neck, like the big ones you get for cracking crab in a restaurant.  The other adult a serving apron, like those blues ones we use in the Immanuel church kitchen.  What do you wear in church, asked the conference leaders,  are you wearing a bib and waiting to be served?  Or are you a person wearing an apron and are ready to serve?  When you come to worship each Sunday, are you a “guest” or are you a “host?”\\n\\tYou and I are called to embody a different way of being in this world; one that contrasts with the striving for priviledge and position that prevails in the culture around us.  It’s upside-down.  The opposite of what we might think will make us happy and secure.  Jesus knew that being a server and not the served is what will ultimately heal us.  It transforms us.  No longer guests at God’s table, but hosts to all who are hungry for God’s love and forgiveness.  Where might we each be challenged to engage Jesus’ upside-down world this week, to “walk, talk and even suffer like Jesus“ in unexpected ways?  From bibs to aprons, that is our challenge.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.    \\n\\n\\t \\n \\n\\n\\n\\t \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\tThis slow shift through darkening November often brings me to a somewhat solemn and reflective mood…..not melancholy really, but quietly alert: this month of early evenings after days of intermittent bright sunshine;  chill wind now whipping through the piles of yellow and brown leaves along our streets.  In the middle of busy autumn, a part of me is watching, waiting.  Perhaps you see and feel it too: All around us, the natural world seems finally stripped down.  As branches become bare, porch furniture disappears into storage, gardens start to wilt and brown.  Nightfall is unexpectedly sudden over the woods and fields, the streaming traffic lights in the rushhour darkness.  I find myself wondering as I move through these late-fall days, what is this air of expectancy? The winter holidays careening around the corner?  No, that’s really not it.  God is astir among us, I sense.  Something, something is next.  \\nWhen I turn to our Gospel text from Luke for this morning, its somber and anticipatory mood seems fitting for this in between time of Mid-November.  Here we sit on the brink of seasonal festivities, right before the holiday chaos and delights that define the season for the much of our American society.  But what is this invitation into a quieter, more reflective space together?  I believe that here within the Christian community, of believers and doubters and all of us in-between, we are offered a curious and audacious task:  we are asked to track God’s movement in this world, and in the world to come, with humility and courage.  United Church of Christ minister and theologian Walter Bruggemann writes that “During November we reach the conclusion of the church year. We remember our dead and ponder the God of life. We begin Advent and the season of alert waiting for the newness that God will give.” (blogging at <explorefaith.com> November 2013).  On the surface, things look pretty hectic around here, lots of good human multi-tasking: packaging 10,000 meals for international hunger relief, delivering over 1200 items of non-perishable food to local Fairfax county foodshelves, many of us privately wondering about holiday meals, guests, shopping, to contemplating how much relief aide to send for typhoon recovery in the Phillipines.  But the middle of November also calls us to pause and consider an even wider view: “For I am about to create new heavens and anew earth;” God proclaims in the writings of the Hebrew prophet Isaiah in the 6th century BCE, as the Jews return from exile in Babylon to their ruined Temple and destroyed homeland.  “The former things shall not be remembered or come to mind,” proclaims God.  “But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating.”  What in the world is God creating, these dazed refugees must have asked then, as Philipline refugees are asking and we may well ask ourselves.  Massive food insecurity around the planet, there will be empty seats at some of our Thanksgiving tables, and the problems look unsurmountable for an impoverished nation trying to rebuild after being flattened.  \\nBut in Christian community, we continue claim that God is astir among us.  Something, something about mercy, newness and transformation, is next. We talk about things unseen, we follow the Spirit of the Risen Christ who is continually reminding us to look beyond appearances.  We are continually being asked to trust God in new and different ways.  This conversation, this stance towards the next, the unknown future, doesn’t make sense to a wider community that is already ratcheting up for the Christmas season. And yet both our Gospel passage and the Isaiah 65 text, offer distinctive counterpoints to our everyday world of doing and producing, escalating schedules and multi-focusing; the world where we are valued by our ability to both build and consume.   Both texts allude to old worlds fading away, as a new reality ushered in by God’s ongoing creation and Jesus’ patterns of mercy is revealed.\\nAs we consider this strange conversation recorded between the disciples and Jesus here in Luke, we find ourselves at the enormous Jerusalem temple: built to accomdate up to 400,000 people inside and out, huge limestone walls.  Built by the paranoid despot, King Herod, who was known for pandering to the Romans and his over-the-top construction projects.  Jesus has already alluded to common Jewish apocalyptic beliefs about certain disasters preceeding the end of history as it is known and the start of God’s full reign on earth.  As he and his followers stand outside the large colonnades and graceful porticoes, the disciples don’t seem to comprehend the looming disaster of Jesus’ arrest and imprisonment. “Jesus, aren’t these temple walls and stones amazing!” the disciples enthusiastically gush.  “Incredible what people can do it they put their mind and backs to it!  Wow, awesome,” we can hear them mutter among themselves.  These small town fishermen make it to the big city and stand gaping up at the skyscrapers.    \\nThey aren’t much different from us, actually.  Aren’t we often in awe of what humankind can construct and produce?  Soaring skyscrapers or dramatic public sculpture, space stations, soaring bridges.  Like the 1st century disciples, it is easy to be enthralled by human ingenuity that seems so massive and so very permanent.  But be it the Jersusalem Temple, our own homes or businesses, the Berlin Wall, our church facility or the World Trade Towers, it can all come tumbling down, for good or for evil.  But was Jesus trying to predict the end of the world….or was he talking about seizing the moment?   According to Biblical literalists and some contemporary writers like Tim LaHaye, this is a time table for which we should fervently plan, defend and prepare.   \\nWalter Brueggemann, in his book Prayers for a Priviledged People challenges this human propensity for permanence and safety.  Consider this prayer poem entitled “Close to Being Empty-Handed” –\\nWe are among the builders,\\n\\tWe do silos and missile silos,\\n\\tWe do tall towers and large granaries,\\n\\tWe do pyramids and monuments and \\n\\t\\tSteeples and high-rises,\\n\\tWe build because we are able,\\n\\t\\tBecause it looks good,\\n\\t\\tBecause it feels good,\\n\\t\\tBecause we have so much stuff to store\\n\\tWe need (a) bigger, better (place to keep things safe)\\nWe make it tall and shiny and beautiful\\n\\tOnly to discover that moth and rust consume,\\n\\t\\t…shiny surface turns empty shell…\\n\\t\\nWe end closer to empty-handed than we imagined.\\n\\nAs we are able we turn from our cities to you,\\n\\t\\tWe turn from our successes to you,\\n\\t\\tWe turn from our reason to you,\\n\\t\\tWe turn from our power to you.\\nTo you, to you, to you, to you,\\n\\tOur help is in no other\\n\\tSave in you alone.\\nYou only, you enough, you in your generosity.\\nWhom have we in heaven but you?  There is nothing on\\n earth that we desire other than you.\\nHear our trust and our thanks and our readiness to obey.\\nJesus was prescient about the destruction of the Temple.  It is destroyed again in 70 CE, as the Romans squash a local Jewish uprising that dared challenge their repressive regime.  And Rome too eventually falls; it’s successes, reason and power crumbling.  But in the midst of turmoil that seems to be with us in every age, God is working in history, Jesus reminds his followers.  Something incredible, God’s hidden workings, are about to be manifest; they are going to be born among you, says Jesus.  Do not despair over these difficult times, or be led astray by false teachers, he admonishes.  Hold fast, be alert and watchful.  See how these times provide an “opportunity to testify,” suggests Jesus.  \\nI heard someone the other day speak of how Jesus’ life teaches us “patterns of mercy.”  Perhaps this is the testimony we have to give in these inbetween times, when a new heaven and new earth are not yet obvious.  We stay focused on living out the “patterns of mercy” he lived:  creating inclusive community, claiming power through non-violent action, caring for the vulnerable. \\nIn a culture where technology and our national propensity for “rugged individualism” isolates us from one another, we come together as a church claiming that more can be accomplished if we join up with others.  Something happens within us as we gather together, claiming that the Spirit of forgiveness, integrity and wholeness is working in our midst. We learn to testify to the movement of the Spirit in our own lives, in the midst of good times and trying times and tragedies. We find ourselves spreading the word that life is more than meets the eye.  Our actions start to testify that humans can turn, in Bruggeman’s words, from the limitations of our successes, our reason, our power, to the ultimate source of life.  And we dare put dollar amounts on making our values real.  We ask ourselves: What are the former things that are passing away?  How can our giving reflect God’s “new heaven and new earth,” as Isaiah describes? All the while watching, waiting, welcoming the new worlds God is creating.  And, in the words of Bruggemann’s prayer, praying:\\nTo you, to you, to you, to you,\\n\\tOur help is in no other save in you alone..\\nHear our trust and our thanks and our readiness to obey.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOnce again we have gathered the school supplies, we have\\nblessed the backpacks and lunch totes and briefcases.  We have prayed that our students have a spirit of diligence, curiosity and hope as they begin this new year.  That teachers and staff may sense our support and be filled with God’s grace.  We are trying equip our young people to navigate an unsteady and confusing world.  Yes, we want them to get smart so they can get ahead in life.  And as Christians we yearn for something more for our children:  we want them to grow in wisdom.  \\n\\n\\tWe live in a culture that is eager to sell us secret wisdom hints for just about anything:  getting good grades, loosing weight, finding your soulmate, business strategies.  Easy to follow maps, if we will only pay the curriculum or seminar price.  But the Biblical understanding of wisdom is different from passing exams or how to get rich or thin or live longer.  Oddly enough, the Bible often describes wisdom as being more like a “free and fabulous banquet, as hospitable to the poor and simple as to the rich and cultured.” (Feasting, p. 338, Year B, Vol. 3)  As today’s Psalm describes, it begins with “the fear of the Lord,” reverence for God, and “is not so evident in the marketplace of ideas.”   Wisdom is what leads us to understanding God’s will and intentions.  \\n\\nThe Book of Proverbs pushes the “free and fabulous” banquet theme a bit further.  This is a banquet served out of a certain dwelling: The House of Wisdom.  We appear to have some specific real estate choices here:  We can either live in the house of wisdom or, as the passage continues from where we read today, one can take up residence in the house of folly. “ Which will it be?  Where will you reside and of which food will you partake?” asks the writer.  Apparently, one cannot live in both, although don’t we all seem to have  some days when we feel like we are running from one house to the other?  One minute making wise choices and the next minute floundering in miscalcuations, mistakes and misunderstandings?  \\n\\t\\n\\tProverbs draws us a picture of Wisdom as a woman who builds her luxuriant mansion and serves up a rich banquet of meat and fine blended wine.  She sends an invitation, far and wide, to all who are simple (actually those lacking in sense) to come feast at her table, to stop being immature – grow up, already – and to “walk in the way of insight.”  Lady Folly in the later verses, is portrayed as loud and ignorant, simply sitting on her stoop and yelling at passersby, offering a meager meal of stolen bread and water.  What kind of diet am I feeling my brain, we might ask ourselves.  Which house, which table, am I eating from.? Because Folly’s way is death.\\n\\t\\n\\tThroughout the Bible we encounter household metaphors of food and feasting to talk about God’s saving and transforming action in the world.  But when Jesus comes along, he starts to interact with food and talk about food in a new way.  Over and over in the gospels we hear about Jesus eating with people:  All kinds of people, all kinds of settings, breaking all kinds of hallowed customs, purity laws and religious rules about who you eat with, how you prepare to eat, when you eat.   I have wondered what kind of eater he was: slow and reflective, last-one-done kind of guy?  Or was he a real chow-hound who got his fingers messy and dribbled on his robe and smacked his own holy lips?  In today’s reading he boldly calls himself “the living bread,” and then says that his followers are supposed to “eat” this bread so we may have abundant and eternal life. “Eat…..me…..” declared Jesus.  And the people said, “What?”  \\n\\nHis listeners heard the echoes of the Proverbs passage as Jesus speaks:  eat at the table of the house of wisdom, eat the flesh, drink the wine.   His 1st century audience lived in a world of sacrificial ritual, both Jewish and pagan.  The celebration of the Eucharist, where early Christians will speak of drinking the blood and eating the flesh of the Risen Christ will eventually astound and appall Jews and pagans alike.  But here stands Jesus saying, this urgent consumption, this eager opening of yourself to me:  “this will make you live.” \\n\\nYears ago, I served a community church on the Central Coast of California that had an interesting mix of members.  We had wealthy retirees living in the wooded Carmel Valley hillsides, young business people making a mint off the early dot.com boom.  There was your usual mix of school teachers and carpenters, folks who serviced the growing tourist industry on the Monterey Peninsula.  Then there was what I affectionately referred to as our cowboy crowd; both ranch owners and ranch hands, who ran the dwindling number of cattle ranches further inland, in the dry, upper Valley region.   I remember visiting one such parishioner, who in his older years had moved off his ranchland to a rundown trailer in a ramshakel mobile home park way out in the Valley hills.  He sported a long grissled beard and was full of wild west sorts of stories.  Every day he would drive an 1 ½ hours to Monterey on the coast, and visit his wife in a care center.   His partner in ranching, a crack horseback-riding cattle wrangler herself, she now had advanced Alheizmers.   I remember well the first time I found him at home;  the rusted and shabby trailer, the summer heat and the smell of his crowded and cluttered home.   I gingerly lowering myself into the cramped dining booth littered with papers and dishes and overflowing ashtrays.  “Let me serve you some lemonade!” he proudly announced.  He produced two incredibly grimy glasses from above the tiny sink, filling them to the brim with lukewarm lemon-something, accompanied by a few saltine crackers. I carefully took ladylike sips and nibbled on a cracker.  He tossed back his lemonade, smacking his lips, stuffed a few saltines in his mouth and proceeded to tell me about his wife, his sweet companion, and how much he missed her.   As I listened, something in me began to relax, something in me shifted and softened. “Take it in,” I silently admonished my young pastoral self, “drink up; something holy is going on here.   My companion was now sputtering saltine crumbs as he talked, lemonade was dribbling down his scraggly beard.  “This is Holy Communion,” I thought to myself.   “Drink in his story, feast on this moment, chew it and gulp this down, girl.  Jesus is somehow here at the table.”  \\n\\nThese many years later, I see that trailer as a house of wisdom, where hospitality was extended and fidelity to a life-long companion was not diminished by memory impairment.  A trailer house where appetite for food, conversation, stories and laughter, was still expansive.  “Drink me up, consume me,” said Jesus.  The word he uses is actually not eat but  “munch” or gnaw.”  Noise-y eating, like that of an animal, or someone who could care less about table manners.   Hear it again:  “very truly, I tell you, unless you munch, gnaw the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.”  Wow.  No wonder the crowd is starting to find this teaching difficult. \\n\\nJesus wants us to take him in, to consume him with urgency.  This is the beginning of our wisdom, to eat at his table, to take Jesus into ourselves.  So maybe we watch this week:  where are we holding back, and simply avoiding communion with the wider world, with certain people, with new ideas or creative actions?  Where will we be invited to take Jesus in this week and gulp and chomp noisily, with relish, enthusiasum, maybe messiness and possibly a new boldness?  Not just at monthly Communion here, but everyday, because Jesus clearly wants us to pull him into ourselves.  Jesus asks us to take into ourselves and commune with his Living Spirit that pervades our world, the people we meet, the places we go, the problems we try to solve.   And so we will truly live, taking up residence in the house of wisdom, where the bountiful meal of God’s extravagant welcome and hospitality are spread before us.  Where our lives are will be transformed. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\t\\n\\n \\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tAs I gazed at this greeting card, I thought about how unpredictable, unsettled the world, and our nation, seems right now.  Many of us continue to follow the impeachment hearings and wonder what will happen next.  Is our nation’s leadership truly helping our nation, the wider world, to be a “safe and secure time and place?”  I think about communities where people don’t believe that their neighborhood, their schools, their houses of worship are a safe and secure places suggested on my insurance company’s greeting card.  In the midst of all this, I can feel this longing for home, places of certainty and safety inside of me, where my adult children and their beloveds join us for celebratory meals, and even relocate to northern Minnesota!\\nI sense there is this disconnect for many of us: between my insurance company’s homey Thanksgiving vision and the way our lives really are.  And in the middle of this disconnect, we come to worship and find that the church calendar does something quite unsettling.  We’re just about ready for Advent and Christmas, and now we are reading about Jesus being mocked as he hangs on the cross?  The timing seems weird.  We’re getting ready to move on to baby Jesus stories!  Many us are struggling to pull it together and move forward with some hopefulness after unsettling days in our church.  We’re doing our best to sing upbeat Thanksgiving hymns, plan a Community dinner and our own personal menus, anticipating the in-gatherings of loved ones.  But, as our cycle of scripture readings conclude at the end of November, every year at this time we are pulled back to the tense days of Jesus’ arrest and execution.  Certainly a jarring departure from visions of predictable safety and security, of families and friends gathering for feasting and fellowship!  \\nThe texts for today challenge us to consider what we really do believe about safety and security in the world, the Kingdom/Realm of God and the ultimate role of Jesus Christ in our lives today.  It was Pope Pius in 1925 who initially put out the call to identify the last Sunday in the liturgical year as  “Christ the King/Reign of Christ Sunday.”  As Protestants, we could certainly ignore this.  But Pope Pius made an oddly prescient decision with this declaration, during a period of both hopefulness and real bleakness in the 1920’s.   It was a time when nations watched the rise of new repressive dictators and fascism emerging in Europe over the shambles of World War I.  Perhaps not a bad idea to invite the church universal to consider some of the wider questions of “who is in charge,” in this chaotic world and how do we hold leaders accountable.  \\nI am not suggesting that triumphalism in phrases like “Christ the King” makes Christianity the only viable or true religion on earth.   I am noticing that\\ntoday’s texts ask us to take a hard look at the very powers that rule among us that are “destroying and scattering,” in Jeremiah’s words.  “Driving away” and hurting the very community that they are charged to support and protect.  The prophet Jeremiah voices God’s concern and dismay as the people of Israel struggle after returning from exile in Babylon 6th century BCE:  a series of Jewish kings had become corrupt. Having sold out to the interests of the wealthy and powerful, they no longer maintain the well-being of the people.  They had not been good shepherds of the people.  As one Biblical commentator (Richard Nysse), notes:  “Hurt caused by poor (human) leadership is a problem for God.”  The text “doesn’t assert specific leadership principles”  - it simply “announces the attention of God and the events that ensue from that attention.”  Or, I would put it a bit more bluntly:  it’s as though God finally says, “damn-it, all of you, Enough!  I’ll do it!  I’m going to gather the remnant, bring them back into the fold, help them be fruitful and multiply, and raise up one in the future who will reign wisely and will rule with justice and righteousness.”  \\n\\tAfter meeting Jesus and choosing to follow the Jesus Way, first century Christians looked back at this ancient text and said to themselves:  Here we are under oppressive Roman imperialist rule.  Yes, Jesus is the one that God was talking about in this prophetic passage, the righteous one to come.  Early Christians would look back to the crucifixion of Jesus and remember the taunting sign above his head, “King of the Jews.”  Jesus was mocked with this title “Messiah,” which was later translated into the Greek word “Christos,” or Christ. In years to come, filled with a sense that Christ’s spirit continued to live in them and guide them, Christians would compare Jesus’ “kingship” or authority to Roman imperial rule of their day.  And it produced a very counter-intuitive image:  because for the early Christians, their’s was a humbled and crucified king.  They followed the spirt of one who governs with compassion and justice, in humility, accompanying the vulenerable.  As the UCC theologian and minister Tony Robinson comments on this passage, whoever Jesus is for us, the New Testament claims that “This King is one who doesn’t rule, but stands with; doesn’t assert but surrenders; is not in the self-interest business.” “Note well,” concludes Robinson, “safety and security are not the result of more security measures or security police or security technology.”  I would suggest this is true of churches following times of intense conflict.  Safety and security does not necessarily come from getting mired in grievances, in re-hashing, in blaming, in tightening up and decreeing new rules that will somehow prevent future conflict between pastor and congregtion, between lay leaders and church members.  As Robinson continues, safety and security “are the result of a healthy community characterized by justice and righteousness.”   I would add, healthy community is characterized by direct and respectful communication, empathy, accountability, humility and forgiveness.\\nIt takes daily practice to absorb this reality that our safety and security are in God.  We won’t get it just from cheery greeting cards.  I’ve spoken before about the huge map of the world that has hung on various living room walls at our home over the years.   One of my prayer practices is to bodily lean against the map.  I think about the mystery of God’s reign of justice and righteousness, hope and mercy and how I might be a larger part of that tending and healing.  I imagine how our home of ultimate safety and security is in the mystery and power of God’s presence.  I am not talking about protection, but about accompaniment.  God-with-us.  Staring at the map, I look for a few hot spots on the planet:  places where enmity and fear and hatred continue to boil.. One could even do this with a map of Cook County, or the City of Grand Marais!   I place my two hands on two different places and lean my head into the map.  I let my prayerful attending imagine God’s restorative attention. \\nThese scripture texts stretch our  imaginations, just as we want to focus inward on hearth and physical home.  The texts remind me that forces of destruction and scattering are not the last word.  God is at work in the midst of all this, inviting our partnership.  The texts call us to notice and attend to those not feeling safe and secure, to accompany those who struggle in these days.  I give thanks for these provocative texts, and for this time to thank God and reflect together.  Amen.  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Book of Esther is great rip of a story with its melodramatic plot and beautiful/courageous heroine.  We have an evil villan, a rather dunce-like and reactionary King.  There are numerous, struggling victims rescued from cruelty and torture in the nick of time.  Even though the word God is never mentioned in the story, down through Jewish and Christian history, this has become a beloved story of how oppressed people often surmount their difficulties.  It reminds us that through our own honesty and goodness, through God’s guidance and also in part because of the foolishness and poor choices of their oppressors, the day can be saved.  Apparently, God can work through all kinds of misfortunes and mishaps.\\n\\nIn this story, evil is surmounted through the faithful piety and fidelity to her origins by the Jewish Queen Esther.  Trying to live in both the Persian world of her husband’s royal court and remain true to her Jewish faith and identity, Esther becomes transformed when she finally risks her life to choose between these two worlds.  She uncovers the prideful and violent plans of the courtier Haman who wants to kill all the Jews in the kingdom.  Esther wields her royal authority for a higher good, risking the wrath of her husband King, and she saves her people.    \\n\\nThrough Jewish history, this story of Queen Esther became a cherished reminder of how God can work through ordinary people called to face evil with extraordinary courage.  Celebrated each year in the Jewish community as the Festival of Purim, it became a legacy story.  It reminded Jews, who often had to live in two different worlds, of who and those they really were.  This is part of what Biblical stories do: they remind us of who and whose we are.  They keep us connected to a larger story than the isolated tale of our individual lives.  \\n\\nHave you ever noticed in listening to someone talk, how they repeated tell a identity-forming story that has really got them stuck?  Maybe you find yourself doing this.  I remember a time in my life when several personal losses seemed to pile on top of each other.  Several miscarriages.  The loss of a beloved job as chaplain when the hospital where I worked downsized a third of its staff.  The story of these losses became my main story.  Yes, it was important for me to grieve these losses, they were real and painful.  But after about a year or so, a friend dared to say to me:  “Anne, sometimes your grief story is the first story you tell about yourself…I hear it over and over.”  She told me this carefully and with great compassion, but it was still hard to hear.  Because it was true.  The story of my losses had begun to define who I was, a quietly tragic victim of circumstances beyond my control.  In my prayers, I stopped asking God “why did these things happen, how could these losses have befallen me.”  I started asking God, “now what?  Where are you leading me now; I am your beloved child, not a victim; how would you have me express that reality in my life?”  A subtle, inner shift in my identity and began to make a world of difference in my life.  \\n\\nHow often our own successes and failures, our family connections and our particular geographical roots seem like the only story that matters and might even limit us.  This is why you and I need these Biblical stories, even the strange ones like Esther’s saga.  They remind us that we are part of a much larger narrative of humanity and God’s purposes.  They remind us of who and whose we are, as beloved, forgiven children of God.   You and I live in a world that divides us into ever smaller affinity groups.  Our different groups have distinctive political views, with specific radio, TV stations and internet sites that reinforce our particular point of view.   From the World War II generation down through the Millenials and new millennial geeration we have broad differences in experience and perspective, that often divide us. The Biblical stories remind us that we a part of a much larger faith group that indeed encircles the globe.  We are followers of Jesus, Christians rooted in and growing up out of the Jewish tradition.  The Bible is filled with our identity stories.  \\n\\nBut the stories don’t just tell us who we have been or are in this moment.  Biblical stories remind me of who I am turning into, which I suppose is why they are often filled with such hope.  And each time I come to them something new is going to reveal itself to me. \\n\\nI find this particularly true in stories about the disciples of Jesus, who really struggled with understanding what Jesus was up to near the end of his ministry.  We can look down our noses and call them dense, but I know I would have winced, even recoiled, at some of his teachings and interactions with people.  I like to think I would have been one of those women who followed him with such devotion, but wonder if I would have resisted understanding Jesus myself, given the chance.  All the talk about suffering and dying; I probably would have been in denial all the way to the cross, if I had been following Jesus back then.  Trying to get it right, but always drawing the circle a bit too small, not quite appreciating how wide and gracious and extravagant Jesus’ invitation to the outsider really was.   This is where the Biblical stories bring me hope about what I might become, about the places in my life that might yet be transformed.  \\n\\nIn today’s text from Mark, the disciples come to Jesus and complain that a certain fellow is casting out demons but not doing it in Jesus’ name.  I smile in recognition of some of  my own pet complaints, especially about popular “spiritual leaders” who have no theological training nor affiliation with a wider faith community. I think about how we debate over the meaning of membership in churches, over what kind of activity or doctrinal assertion is needed for someone to be one of us.   And there is Jesus, always drawing the circle wider, pushing his followers to see true hospitality in a broader context.  Reminding them not to become a stumbling block for the new disciples, not to overwhelm them with expectations and committee assignments that become like millstones around their necks.  This is the Biblical story in its prophetic role.  It pushes and challenges us to change.  (p. 48)\\n\\nRepeated, daily encounters with the Biblical stories help me see how God accepts us as we are, but also that God does not want to let us stay that way. These stories help us get clear about who we are, and help us claim that identity as God’s beloved ones.  These stories call us up out of ourselves, into the new, wider perspectives and new choices God would have us make as faithful people. \\nThanks be to God for our sacred scriptures.  They are our identity stories; both prophetic challenge and source of hope.   Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tIt occurred to me this week that sometimes Jesus speaks like an intentional interim pastor.  Did you catch this part in today’s text, where Jesus is talking with his followers at what will become their final meal together?  “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.”  Jesus had a strong sense of the challenges that lay ahead for those who would follow in his Way of self-emptying love, radical inclusivity, passion for justice.  He understood human overwhelm, especially when it is filled with longing, grief and anxiety about the future.   “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.”  So often in my interim ministry with congregations, there are things I want to say that people cannot bear.  In the churches I serve, I often encounter expressions among some members of longing for the former days, the good old days, in their church life together.  Underneath the familiar tales of once-full Sunday school classes, multiple young families, numerous women’s circles, nursery staffed by parent volunteers, members who were really committed to church and filling the pews every Sunday, I hear a deep yearning for what was.  I hear grief about what has been lost.  The institutional future of church as we have know it is unclear.  I have found that no amount of money in an endowment fund can guarantee a church’s vibrant future.  People are understandably anxious about this.  So often, like Jesus, the thing I want to say, the thing that some people cannot bear, is this:  the church you loved is gone.   And I often wonder, are congregations ready for, open to the new thing that God wants to build in their midst?\\n\\n\\tAmong my seminary classmates, we have a saying:  “the church we were taught to serve no longer exists.”   We began our ministries in the late 1970’s on the tail-end of the great post World War II Protestant church building explosion.   We were trained to craft intellectual lecture-like sermons, to lead huge youth groups and multiple adult education forums, to direct large Sunday School and outreach programs.  Church as the center of the community!  I think back to that time, which now looks like the technological dark-ages: hammering out sermons on a typewriter, using paper maps to get to parishioners homes and hospitals, the clacking stencil machine used to produce the worship bulletin.  But this was the norm, and church-going was the norm and everyone assumed we lived in a “Christian nation” with shared experiences and expectations about God, civic duty and community participation.  \\n\\n\\tInexperienced and optimistic, most of my classmates and I were called to churches that were, in reality, slowly beginning to experience drop in attendance and dollars. And through the decades, my clergy colleagues and I have heard an ongoing lament:  “The church used to be the center of our lives, there were no kids sports on Sunday, and church activities were the focus of our community….like a community center!  And people were committed!”\\t\\n\\n\\tThe Gospel of John tells us that on the night of his arrest, Jesus looked around the across the supper table at the men and women who had been his closest companions, who had listened to him teach, had prayed and eaten countless meals with him, watched him heal and debate with the religious elders.  Jesus must have felt really torn, as he sensed his time with them was short.  There were many things they just couldn’t bear, couldn’t handle at this point.  And so he continued: “When the Spirit of truth comes, it will guide you into all the truth; for the Spirit will not speak on it’s own, but will speak whatever it hears, and it will declare to you the things that are to come.”   Once again, Jesus is grappling with simple words that describe a great mystery:  this aspect of the divine that has been present at the beginning of creation, God’s spirit, God’s breath, that moved over the watery chaos, this Spirit, this Comforter and Advocate as Jesus would it, is in me and here for all of you.  Guiding us, like a conduit for God’s word of truth.  How to imagine this?  Like billions of thin filaments of fiber-optic cable, running from God to each of us and between us, weaving a web of sparking connection among all things?  Like a vast cloud, an ether, filled with particles of insight, flowing between God to humans?  Not really a conduit for discrete facts, but a relational network, humming, vibrating, connecting.  A relational community of God, within God the Creator, Jesus the son and the Holy Spirit.  What do you see in your minds eye?  What is the truth about the church that the Spirit can teach us in this time?  What will help us bear the bad news about the end of church as we have known it, and welcome the good news of what’s to come?  \\n\\tI recently came upon the writings of a Lutheran pastor in western Canada named Erik Parker.  He blogs at a site he calls: The Millennial Pastor: An iPhone Pastor for a Typewriter Church.”  What a great image:  we’re in the land of the internet and smart phones, but sometimes the church still seems back in the typewriter age!  In a recent post called “Why Nothing Seems To Get People Back To Church – The Issue At The Core Of Decline,” Pastor Parker unpacks the current debate about young people’s supposed lack of commitment.  \\n\\n\\tWe are stuck, Parker contends, with focusing on seeing the church as community, to which we make a social commitment. “Most churches are, at their core, institutions formed around a social or societal commitment,” writes Parker. “The core of churches have been based on the fact that people (were) expected to attend because of societal pressures….These churches did good ministry, …. and they were servant communities. But now that society is no longer providing the pressure to be church attenders, (and there are so many new social committments vying for people’s time and energy,) attracting people to a social commitment at church doesn’t work.  In fact, it may be the very thing that is driving people away.”\\n\\tHe reminds us how today, both parents work in most families and household duties need attention on weekends.  But also, “People are choosing things that they are passionate about, things that they love” for their precious weekend hours.  Shared love of sports, brunch, sleeping in, music, time with family, being in the great outdoors.  “But what is our shared loved at church?” Parker asks.  “Are we just communities to join without a shared passion?  If I had to guess, the vast majority of people who still might be looking for a church in 2016 are not looking for a social commitment to church.  As a millennial,” Parker continues, “I never lived in the era of social commitment or social pressure to go to church. While most of my peers growing up weren’t interested in church, nor exposed to it beyond Christmas and Easter, the ones who did express interest did not do it for the social commitment.”  The shared passion church goers are looking for, claims Parker?  “My church going peers are interested in following Jesus.”\\n\\t“Now, imagine someone is looking for a church. They are looking for a church with a commitment to following Jesus at its core and they show up at a social commitment church. It would be like showing up for a soccer team that stopped playing soccer years ago, and who instead gathers for coffee and donuts with friends and family. But this gathering of people still call themselves a soccer team.  Now\\xa0imagine members of that ‘soccer team’ wringing their hands week after week over the fact that no one wants to join the team to clean up coffee and pick up the donuts. You can see why soccer players looking for a team wouldn’t join. You can see why many members of the team left a long time ago.”\\t\\n\\tThis is the news we cannot bear.  People are interested in following Jesus, and exploring this beyond simple socializing.  And we can’t bear this because, as liberal-minded Christians who have focused on the social aspect of church going for so many years, we often get nervous around the Jesus talk.  His radical call to transformation, to changed lives, is perhaps more than we bargained for.  I need to change?  You need to change?  Maybe we worry this will make us look like judgmental fundamentalists and that we are consigning all non-followers of Jesus to hell.   We hesitate to talk with one another about the Jesus who says things like:  “The Spirit will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.”   Does it make us squirm, this notion of God and Jesus so interconnected that all that God has belongs also to Jesus?  “All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you,” continues Jesus.   Statements like this make Jesus looks so divine-ish, and maybe we would just rather be Christian-ish: moral, good people who share a sense of civic duty in coming to church. \\n\\tThe Gospel writer John’s community was experiencing something different, something life-changing, something also offered to us in these uncertain times.  Jesus’ on-going empowering presence and challenging teaching, coming through the presence of the Spirit, even now.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tThere were eight of us pastors and two trainers, gathered last week in a small UCC church in rolling hills of western Maryland.  Day one of a required two-day continuing education event for clergy called “Boundary Awareness Training.”   All across the country, United Church of Christ clergy are required to attend these classes every three to five years.  Here pastors are reminded about the spiritual and emotional power they wield in peoples’ lives, and how they are to use it appropriately.   We learn and talk about respecting other people’s personal boundaries and maintain our own professional boundaries in our ministries with them.  Good things for pastors to regularly think about.  Good things for congregations to ponder as they search for a new pastor, as Immanuel is here.\\t\\n\\tLate morning of day one and already the wooden chairs felt hard!  I had eaten one too many donuts and consumed way too much coffee.  Videos, discussions, role-playing, more discussions.   But I was glad to be there, and to share ideas and wonderings about what has been called “This Odd and Wondrous calling” (Daniels and Copenhaer with other pastors in a focused and safe setting.  While this was not new material for me, I found myself thinking about much has changed since I was ordained 3 decades ago.   Religious leaders used to be mostly male, with the cultural prestige that gender brought, were often the most educated person in the congregation and were widely respected, as was the church, as a community leader.   A Pastor was seen as the church boss and ultimate authority, at least on the surface of things in churches.  Some people think it is a shame that both pastors and churches don’t carry that kind of natural authority as roles and institutions anymore.   Yet, I personally find it hopeful that we are at a more collaborative place in most congregations.  Pastors don’t have to pretend they are perfect; they don’t wield power “over” a congregation.  Pastors are here to equip and encourage all of us in ministry together.  \\n\\tThrough the days, we moved through different scenarios from the obvious wrong (bad clergy behavior that can land you in jail) to the wide grey areas of possibly problematic.  Grey areas like accepting gifts and favors from cookies to condos, showing favoritism or even becoming best friends with certain people in the church, being always available to the point where you do everything and then burn yourself out.  We were reminded to consider, in situation after situation, how the pastor must always remember where he or she ends and parishioner begins. How we make sure as pastors we are not meeting our own needs in our ministry setting?  How do we recognize our own limits and limitations, and do what is in the best interest of the individuals in our flock?  No easy answers here.   But some “best practices” do begin to emerge, I have found, if you submit yourself to some thoughtful teaching and have some trusted colleagues with whom to share your mis-steps and blunders!\\n\\tWhile I was sitting on that hard chair, I was also ruminating about our scripture texts for this morning. Today is “Good Shepherd Sunday,” fourth Sunday in Easter when the readings include Psalm 23: “the Lord is my Shepherd.”  And Jesus describing to his disciples that he is the “Good Shepherd” who knows his sheep by name and they know his voice.  The Good Shepherd who, unlike a hired hand, lays down his life for his sheep.   Interesting coincidence, if there are in deed coincidences: The word “pastor” comes from this pastoring imagery.  Within the Christian tradition, there have been long-time assumptions that the clergy leader is “shepherd” of the flock. \\n\\tNow, might we say that Immanuel is in search of a new “shepherd?”  Your Pastoral Search Committee met a week ago with the governing board, the Church Council.  The Search Cmt. presented for review and feedback the some 28 page church profile that is a compiling of all the member questionnaires many of you completed.  The church profile tells about the church’s history, current vision and mission, and what kind of leadership you need to follow God’s call in the next decade or so.  It will go out to clergy candidates who are interested in the position, sort of like a “church resume.”  How helpful is this “shepherd” imagery as you think about being church together, as you think about new pastoral leadership?\\n\\tFirst of all, perhaps we should consider this question:  how’s it feel to be compared to a sheep?  As I just described to the children, there is this assumption that sheep are unruly and dumb, but that might not be the whole story.  They may be very good at doing what God intended them to do, which is to be herding animals with acute senses whose safety is in numbers.\\n\\tBut if Jesus is the Good Shepherd, and pastor is from the Greek word meaning “to shepherd,” does that mean that pastors are sort of like junior shepherds?   I used to think so, in fact in seminary we were often admonished that we needed to chase after our flocks, search out the one lost member at all costs and be willing to lay our lives down for them, like Jesus.  No wonder we got our priorities in ministry a bit skewed, exhausted ourselves unnecessarily thinking we were the savior and got burned out!  I now think the shepherd imagery applied to pastors is not quite correct and it is because I heard a certain dog story.  \\n\\tI ran into a story about a sheepdog, Esau, written by Esau’s human, a Presbyterian pastor named Craig Barnes.  Now apparently, Esau is a bearded collie, which is actually a hairy Scottish sheepdog.  Rev. Barnes used to think that he too was called to be a shepherd of his congregational flock.   But at some point he noticed that each morning, on their walk, Esau would sniff all around and happily wag his tail.  Cloudy or sunny day.  Same thing.  Happy to be alive!  “Hmmmm,” though Rev. Barnes, “I wonder if I’m supposed to be the one who is to keep paying attention to the goodness all around us and remind people about it.”   He noticed that when the family would go to the beach, Esau would try to herd the birds.  Not by running straight at them, in a head on confrontation, but coming in slant.  “Ahhhhhh” thought Rev. Barnes, I might try that more often with my congregation.  Esau would not go to bed until everyone in the house came upstairs to their bedrooms.  Rev. Barnes also realized that the dog park was not really fun for Esau, because Esau kept trying to round up the other dogs.  “Yes,” though Rev. Barnes, ministry is not always fun and games.   Pastors need to worry about the order and well-being of the whole community.  My delight is not to be in chasing Frisbees but “in helping others gather around the Good shepherd.”  He even went to watch some other border collies at some sheep herding trials.  He noticed how the dogs didn’t bark much or make a lot of fuss; they would actually spend quite a bit of time sitting still and looking at the shepherd.  “These dogs are faithful agents of another mind,” Rev. Barnes thought to himself.  “Always obedient to the master’s, the shepherd’s directive will.”  He realized that the shepherd was the center of the sheep dogs life, not the sheep.  The sheepdog works with a scheme that is not his or her own.  And the only way the sheepdog keeps up this good, herding work is because it frequently sits down, is very still and intently watches the master, the shepherd.  And it rests when the day is done.  “That’s it,” Rev. Barnes admitted to himself.  My job as a pastor is to nudge the sheep towards the only savior of the flock.  Jesus, the Good Shepherd who lays down HIS life for his sheep.\\n\\tAs a pastor, I continue to learn how to sit still and watch and listen to the master shepherd, our Good Shepherd our Risen Lord.  And without barking or fussing or ostentatious displays of authority, try to lovingly nip at all of your heels.  I too am just one of God’s creatures, an animal in this analogy, just like each of you.  Not better or worse, simply with certain tasks to do.  Reminding you that “God’s grace is always in the air.”  And reminding myself that I save no one, which is actually a way of practicing good boundaries and is a great relief.  I am simply to be “a faithful agent of another mind,” in obedience to the best I can understand of the master’s will.   So, for this time and place we explore, hopefully with humility and good humor, our respective roles as sheep and sheepdog.  Looking to our master, the Good Shepherd.  Praying for guidance in choosing the new sheepdog.  Listening to the sound of his voice, for the Shepherd’s direction.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t',\n",
       " 'We have some challenging, gritty themes in today’s scripture lessons.  Perhaps this is fitting, given the tumultuous waters this church has navigated over many months and that we will assemble for our summer congregational meeting after worship today.  From contentious congregational meetings to contentious presidential debates to contentious editorials about gay people in our local newspaper, I sense an general urgency about “how are we to live together in community?”  Luke’s text, focusing on the costs of being on the “Jesus Way,” is blunt and almost callous about this question.  What is Jesus getting at here?  The Apostle Paul goes on a rant about bad behavior and then lifts up seemingly impossible behavior standards.  But how do we be and act together as humans?  To push us a bit further, what might these ancient texts have to say to us, here at the conclusion of PRIDE month, as an Open and Affirming Congregation?  Perhaps that’s a good place as any to start.\\nWe live in an era when the majority of millennials polled claim that the Christian church as a whole is homophobic.  Across the globe, LGBTQ people are harassed and shunned, and in some places are arrested and even executed. Our nation has finally legalized same gender marriage and the opening of our military, adoption rights, housing and employment opportunities to the LGBTQ community.  But in recent years, many of these advances are being challenged and eroding.  Violence against transgender people, particularly women of color, continues to sky-rocket.  Here in this church, we fly the rainbow flag and affirm the freedom of letting people be who they are as children of God.  You took a vote in ____and proclaimed that human dignity and respect applies to all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.  This is something of which we can be proud.  But now what?  How do we truly live out this pronouncement in new ways?  How might today’s scripture readings compel us to new action together?\\nHere in Paul’s letter to the young church at Galatia, he is urging his congregation to consider the nature of freedom they now experience as a community of the Risen Christ.  “Freedom,” interesting choice of words.  Often people compare Christian ethics to a pair of constricting undergarments.   For freedom Christ has set us free, writes Paul.  Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.13\\xa0For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters;[]\\xa0only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence,[]\\xa0but through love become slaves to one another.\\xa0He is not talking about being a prissy, well-behaved nice Christians.  He is inviting followers of Jesus to recognize they take on a new “yoke,” a new obligation of compassion and respect in community together.  More specifically, he warns them about the “works of the flesh,” about destructive behavior that can enslave us.  Don’t get caught up in the “flesh” word and think this is just about naughty things we might do with our bodies.  Paul speaks of behavior that comes out of our anxious survival mode, when we are most fearful or angry or sad.   Living out of this instinct for survival, self-protection, inhibits the “fruits of the Spirit” growing in us.  We “bite and devour each other” says Paul.  Ouch.  That hits close to home - ? We can lose track of how to be loving, joyful, patient, kind, generous, and gentle with one another.  We lose our self-control and become reactive.  We seem enslaved by our fear and anger and deep grief.  Pay attention to this inside work, Paul insists, especially if you start to feel anxious and self-protective!\\nThe Luke passage is equally demanding.  The writer describes Jesus  “with his face set towards Jerusalem.”  Luke uses this common Semitic phrase, “his face set,” which is meant to show one’s opposition or hostility.  The reader is reminded that Jesus has become accepting of the opposition to his radical teachings on the Kingdom of God.  Not some pie-in-the-sky reward of heaven. Jesus described God’s kingdom as breaking into the present reality, as compassion and justice and equality and freedom spreading through communities and systems of oppression.  He now sets his eyes on a collision course with those in religious and political power in the great city. \\nPerhaps we can picture the group of men and women traveling through the country-side with this Jesus who is sounding more and more agitated and insistent.  We might imagine a disquiet settling over these faithful companions who have ministered with him through Galilee.  Jesus probably seems more inwardly focused.  His words are cutting more sharply and opposition with the authorities increases.  The tension has been building among them; the disciples are probably feeling uncertain and even frightened.  People seldom act well when they are anxious and afraid. It’s not surprising what comes out of their mouths next.\\n“You won’t believe this Jesus, but those Samaritans who wanted us to talk to?  So rude! They wouldn’t even extend us the expected stranger hospitality!  They said you are going to the wrong sanctuary, the Temple Jerusalem!  They think Mt. Gerizim is the correct sanctuary for feast days and festivals, so they won’t help a pilgrim traveler headed for what they consider to be the wrong sanctuary!  We couldn’t believe our ears!  It’s outrageous!  What do you say we “command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”   “What are you thinking?” Jesus replies.  We can imagine his jaw is set in annoyance, his eyes flashing with anger:  “What is it about ‘love your enemy’ that you do not understand?”  I can relate to these disciples’ reaction and desire to lash out.  I can imagine Jesus being frustrated with my own overreactions when I want to attack someone with firey vengence for this-that-or-the-other-offense.  “Well, it would be just easier if this person were somehow taken out of the picture,” I confess I have muttered to myself, and to God, more than once in my life.  \\nBut Jesus is already moving forward and we do well to pay attention.  He doesn’t punish the inhospitable Samaritans who reject his message, nor the disciples for their irrationally reactive suggestion.   It is clear that not only are they not to punish those who reject Jesus’ message; they are simply to let them go.  This is deeply challenging for most of us.  It has implications for our personal lives as well as our life together as a congregation.  There is both loss and learning in a time of major transition such as ours here.  We have the possibility of being carried into the future by God’s intentions among us, by God’s mission as we understand it.  Some will agree with our sense of mission and purpose and come with us, and some will go elsewhere.  Luke tells us Jesus kept moving forward:  and “then they went on to another village.”\\t\\nAs if this doesn’t give us pause…..What comes next in the reading is tough language about discipleship: somebody is gushing that they will follow Jesus wherever he goes and he replies: “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”   As one Biblical commentator has noted (Walter Brueggeman) “there will be no safe place and we can’t look back to previous loyalities.”  (Brueggman blog, Sojourners).  For a congregation in transition this might this be a warning about previous loyalities to previous pastors, or perhaps more painfully, loyalties to longtime members or previous lay leaders who have now disappeared.   One of the disciples seems eager to respond to Jesus but insists: “Jesus, first I have to bury my dead.”  Another pipes up, “I have to say farewell to my family.”  Affection for past leadership, honoring one’s dead, connecting with family; none of these are bad or evil in themselves.  Yet Jesus is pointing into the future.  \\nWhen the first PRIDE parade happened in New York City 50 years ago, it challenged us into the future as a nation and as Christian communities. The United Church of Christ  became one of the first Protestant denominations to embrace this challenge of affirming diversity and equality, with the ordination of the first openly gay minister, support of same-gender marriage and protection of transgender people.  As a denomination, we claim that Jesus envisioned a different kind of social, cultural and political order, where people are treated with dignity and equality, no matter who they love.  Where might this point us in the future?\\nNo one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God, Jesus concludes in today’s reading.  Palestinian plows were both light and notoriously wobbly.  If the farmer did not keep one hand firmly on the plow, the other hand holding the reigns of the unruly oxen, and both eyes focused on the path ahead, the furrow would quickly become crooked.  Inefficient farming and a waste of energy.   \\n\\tWithout ignoring the past, a congregation in transition needs to stay focused on what is happening in this moment and what God is calling it to in the future.  How do we learn to live together differently, to truly engage the “fruits of the Spirit?”  Hands to the plow, looking forward with a sense of urgency; I believe this is how we slowly renew and re-vitalized our ministries together.  Showing up for one another in worship, engaging each other respectfully in fellowship and service, doing the personal inner work where we feel anxious or sad or annoyed, praying fiercely for one another and for the new Board of Directors.  These are the parts of leadership that everyone needs to pick up this summer.  Challenging tasks ahead for us. Necessary and urgently possible.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tLike many of you since Sunday mornings shooting rampage in the Pulse nightclub, I have heard a legion voices in my head this week:  A crime that blends a still unclear combination of hate, homophobia and terrorism: 50 people dead, 49 assault victims and one perpetrator; scores injured.  My brain has been filled with a cacophony of news analysis and speculation, feelings of shock and fury towards the shooter, fear for the on-going safety of people I know and love in the LGBT community.  My mind is swirling with angry retorts against extremist Christian clergy who hope for more gay people to be killed.  Exasperation with the way our leaders block sensible means by which gun violence can be curbed.  My mind groans with horror and sadness at how the Muslim religion is vilified and Muslim people are sterotyped and targeted.  During frightening and confusing times, voices in our head can buffet any of us back and forth and unsettle and distance us from our true selves.  The man who encountered Jesus was overwhelmed with voices and had lost a sense of who he was.  He had even forgotten his own name.  Voices rattle in our heads, calling for the banning of Muslims entering our nation, listing countless legislative attempts to restrict the civil rights of LGBT people, and calls to suppress any gun controls. In the midst of our own anxiety and fear, how might we actively remember who we are in the midst of all these conflicting voices, in these chaotic times?   How do we remember our names as God’s beloved, as God’s kin, as sons and daughters of the Living God called to works of both justice and mercy.\\nWe notice that “Legion,” the demons in the story, bargain with Jesus.  It’s almost comical: “oh please don’t send us to the abyss,” they whine, “as we will surely perish in its watery depths.  Send us into those harmless pigs over there, and we won’t bother this guy anymore.”  Jesus consents, only to have the herd of pigs panic and rush off a cliff and drown.  This throws the whole town into understandable upheaval.  Swineherds have lost their livelihood and now this man who has been ostracized and imprisoned as unclean, impure and dangerous is looking strangely normal.  They find him sitting at Jesus feet, a position common to students of a great teacher.  He is clothed.  He is “in his right mind.”  Do they celebrate that their neighbor has been restored to them?  No.  Everyone is so terrified at this sign of Jesus’ power and authority that they beg Jesus to leave.   The transformed man implores Jesus to let him join up as a follower, but oddly Jesus tells him to go home and “declare how much God has done for you.”  And the man does just that; he goes about “proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.”  \\n\\tThis story reminds me that when God does things in our lives, it does not always make life easier or smoother.  The man formerly possessed by demons had to return to a wary community who had paid a great cost (through lost livestock) for his healing. It would take a long time for people to understand and accept his transformation, his new identity reality.  There is something truly disruptive about God’s power among us, which challenges social assumptions and unsettles social order.\\nThe apostle Paul, in his letter to the churches in Galatia, is working with this new identity reality in the passage we just heard from chapter 3.  Paul and the growing number of non-Jews and Gentiles drawn to the Christian faith were debating: Do non-Jewish Christians need to follow Jewish law? Do the new believers have to be circumcised if they are men?  Do they have to follow Jewish dietary rules?  Paul insists that through our welcoming of the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ into our hearts, by confessing Christ, we are in Paul’s words, “all children of God through faith.”  We lean into the reality that we are all already received into God’s presence as children who are welcomed by a loving Parent.  This is how we thrive as followers of Jesus Christ; not by adhering to certain rules of conduct. It’s by becoming who we are, insists Paul: God’s children, God’s kin. \\n\\tAnd divisions of culture, status and gender are dissolved in this common kinship with one another, says the Paul.   “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.” But notice that right before launching into this much quoted inclusive vision, Paul writes a curious thing:  “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”  \\n\\tThis image probably sounds a bit odd to us.  “Clothed with Christ?” Apparently, in the region of Galatia, power and prestige came from being a Roman citizen, specifically a male Roman citizen.  All young men born of Roman citizens throughout the Empire were given a new garment at age 16 in a special public coming of age ceremony.  The Roman “toga virilis” was some 20 yards of fine white wool cloth.   It was wrapped around the young man and worn throughout his life as an outer garment that signified to all his citizenship and elite social status. \\n\\tFamiliar with this Roman tradition, Paul used this clothing metaphor to speak of our life with Christ.  But not just for men, not just for men of a certain social class.  No, for male and female, Jew and Gentile, slave and free.  All of us, each of our very selves are now subject to a transformative power within this being clothed in Christ.  Parts of our old self, habits and attitudes that no longer serve God’s purposes, are slowly being stripped away as our new self is constantly renewed “according to the image of” the Risen Jesus Christ.  \\n\\tWe could each imagine in our mind’s eye what were we clothed with before we began to encounter God’s transformative power in our life.  Maybe we felt a certain nakedness and vulnerability.  Or may were some some past “cloaks” we have each been able to shed as we have slowly opened up to God’s extravagant welcome, God’s compassion acceptance of all of who we are. Can you see a cloak of your old life?  Is it ragged and torn?  Stinky, heavy or dark?  Perhaps it is gaudy flashy bright, perhaps hard and armor-like?  Can you picture it?  It may not have fully disappeared.  Transformation is an evolving process.  Do you find yourself taking the old cloak back on occasionally?  A cloak of defensiveness or of protective self-deprecation?  A cloak of arrogance or cynicism?  Perhaps you are at a point where you have yet to welcome the spirit of the living God into your heart, and have yet to know yourself “clothed with Christ.”  Maybe today is a beginning for you.    \\t\\n\\tAs you and I face the inevitable challenges of the week ahead, we might try this as a spiritual practice:  inwardly say with Paul, “I am clothed in Christ.”   Perhaps imagine yourself sitting quietly at Jesus’ feet, the voices stilled for a moment, clothed and in your right mind, healed and whole; ready to hear where he will send you.  “Clothed in Christ” – what do you see?  I imagine a glimmering, soft fabric of bright light, floating over my shoulders and down to my toes.  It has helped calm the voices in my head, as I lean into what God calls me to courageously do and say in this moment, in this place. \\n\\tClothes make the man, said Twain, and I would say the woman also.  “I am clothed in Christ,” we say along with the apostle Paul.  What will this precious, imaginative apparel make of each of us, this week and in the days to come?  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBut then I realized that, while catchy, this little ditty didn’t do justice to where we are in the post-Easter Biblical story.  Still using first century language, I decided re-order the directions here:  Down, Up and Out.  Jesus comes DOWN at birth at Christmas, he rises UP finally at the Ascension and sends his disciples OUT to minister in his name.  But in the Biblical narrative, the Holy Spirit doesn’t come DOWN to empower his followers until NEXT week, on Pentecost.  So, I tweaked the good reverend’s sermon title…and I am probably tweaking YOU ALL at this point with this weird geographic language.  Because we have a problem here: You and I do not live in a DOWN UP DOWN world.  Modern science has clearly told us otherwise; no UP or DOWN in space! And now this wild story appears, after Jesus, having been killed, has reportedly been presenting himself as alive, for 40 days, speaking about the Kingdom of God.  What do we make of all this?  How do these stories lead us to better understand: “who is this Jesus?”\\n\\tWe can’t really tell from the Biblical record just when Jesus stopped appearing to people after he died.  It’s all a bit vague, and many of the recorded stories seem to contradict each other when it comes to time and place.   Our two scriptures today are probably written by the same author, and were originally one scroll called “Luke-Acts.”   The author is writing for his Jewish-Christian community in the late first century.  These people have a strong sense of Jesus’ continued spirit working among them and are immersed in an oral tradition which has passed on stories of his works and his teachings.  These people are also familiar with this idea of important people ascending up into the sky.  This imagery may seem ridiculous to us.  But for first century readers, stories of heavenly ascents were pretty common.  Different prophets, like Elijah and Enoch, were remembered as being lifted into heaven. The Roman Emperor Augustus ascended in a similar manner, supposedly in full view of the Roman Senators.  Same with the Greek hero Heracles, among others.   Authors used this ascension imagery as a literary device to confer divinity on a human.   These ascension stories about Jesus became more important as the early church struggled with understanding how Jesus might have been BOTH human AND divine.  Jesus hung around, in one form or another for the symbolic 40 days, a Biblical number relating to a time of spiritual preparation, then he….well, departed. Or perhaps a better way to say this is: “he was exaulted.”  In some way or another, the Biblical writers are saying Jesus goes cosmic.  Now he is everywhere.  And Jesus’ teachings that the kingdom of heaven, the reign of God, is within you, starts to make more sense.  But the problem remains: what do we do with these stories that incorporate a world view that is so radically different from ours today?\\nI think sometimes we get stuck asking the wrong questions about scripture.  Sometimes I feel myself getting perplexed and huffy and frustrated: “what in the world does this mean?”  But this week I bumped into another way of making sense out of the Bible.  For a moment, try on this way of approaching the text: “what kind of people do we need to be for this make sense?”  This is the question posed by the Biblical scholar Mark Branson, seminary professor and Methodist minister.  He didn’t mean, you must be a perfect person, or a totally faithful believer or take the Bible literally.  Rev. Branson affirms that there may be a deeper, metaphorical meaning to a particular story, one that tells us about the all-pervasive presence of God, as known through Jesus.  But if we are only looking to receive this as information, in our head, it won’t do anything to us.  When we read the Bible, we have to start out with the openness to being changed.  In my experience, none of the Good News of the Gospel makes a darn bit of sense unless I am willing to take the risk of being a recipient, a host, for God’s transformative possibilities.  Until I am willing to let go of some control in my life and be willing to change.  Rev. Branson’s suggests that if we always approach a Biblical text with “what the heck does this means?  we miss letting Scripture change us.  Yes, he writes, we interpret Scripture, but it also interprets us.  How is God forming us as we read this passage?  “Go out and be my witnesses to the ends of the earth,” Jesus said.  What kind of person do I need to be for this to make sense?  Not necessarily a pre-rational, non-scientific person.  No.  But I need to be a person open to more than cognitive brain-knowing and fact finding.  I need to be open to a deeper, intuitive, riskier heart-knowing for this promise of the on-going presence of the risen Jesus to make any sense.  For it to change who I am and how I act in the world.\\n“Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying; “don’t impose your faith or beliefs, but be ready to witness to the fresh and transforming experience of God you are having!”   Be a part of a faith community where you work together on being accountable, where we name it when we make mistakes, where we learn to forgive each other as we reach out to those in need beyond our doors.  Be part of an intentional community where people can study scripture together, disagree in love.  Where everyone gets to be heard, all perspectives can be shared, because God speaks uniquely to each of us and these perspectives need to be shared for the good of the whole!   Be a part of a faith community where you are willing to be changed, for the sake of others.\\n\\tWithout being formed by God through learning/soaking in the scriptures, and immersing ourselves in transformative experiences of worship, I don’t see how we are going to have the motivation and the inner juice to serve in Jesus name over the long haul, for the sake of others.  Sure, we can do it, out of the goodness of our hearts… but our egos will get all caught up in being good givers, pleasing someone other than God, working tirelessly because we think it is the civic thing to do.  Our identities then get caught up in being the ones in charge of all the do-gooding.  We get defensive and resistant to different ways of doing things.  The church is not a civic organization or local non-profit; the church is an alive body; it is Jesus’ hands and feet in a particular time and place, and must be led by people open to inner formation.  Because it is the power of God’s transforming spirit that actually equips, empowers and sustains us to serve in Jesus’ name.\\n\\t  “Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying;  “be ready to share the Good News of the transforming experience of God you are having!”  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIt’s a bit difficult to understand these words of Jesus.  He doesn’t beat around the bush, but he also seems circles around.  Jesus actually sounds a bit bossy in places: “if you love me, you will keep my commandments” and then he takes on this tender and compassionate tone: “I will not abandon you, I will not leave you orphaned.”   There is no story line to follow, no parable from daily life we might connect with….only this direct urgency about mysterious, unseen things.  Jesus is talking with his followers, the men and women who have traveled and minister alongside of him for three years, at their final meal together in Jerusalem.  It is beginning to dawn on his followers that something terrible is about to happen, and their lives may well be upended.  These words are like one of those breathless goodbyes, when you try to cram everything loving and hopeful into a last few sentences.  Kind of like hurried, awkward departure:  your parents dropping you off at an airport or a college dorm, fumbling, overcome with emotion and concern.   In the middle of life changes, transition, jumbled emotions, maybe deep truths come out like this….sort of loopy and vague and directive all at once.   What might we hear this morning, I wonder, in this seasons of endings and new beginnings: changing leadership in our congregation, in the approach of retirement/re-wirement for myself, in this dramatic transition for our graduates?\\n\\tJesus tells his friends that he will send “another Advocate,” another counselor, another presence, “the Spirit of truth” in his impending absence.  Once again, Jesus is grappling with simple words that describe a great mystery:  this aspect of the divine that has been present at the beginning of creation, God’s spirit, God’s breath, that moved over the watery chaos.   This Spirit, this Comforter and Advocate as Jesus would it, actually abides in us.  Guiding us, like a conduit for God’s word of truth.  How to imagine this?  Like billions of thin filaments of fiber-optic cable, running from God to each of us and between us, weaving a web of sparking connection among all things?  Like a vast cloud, an ether, filled with particles of insight, flowing between God to humans?  Not really a conduit for discrete facts, but a relational network, humming and vibrating like tiny atomic particles, like giant whirling galaxies……connecting each of us to a vast yet intimate animating power? \\n\\tIt’s been quite amazing to be part of so many converations around here, over these last few weeks, where we have been grappling with what this mystery might mean for us.  For those of you new to our congregation, we have been mightly struggling with several unexpected deaths, as well as the severe injury of a beloved member in a car accident.  Anniversaries of the deaths of other church members have cycled around in this time.  We are saying goodbyes, as I prepare to retire and leave in a few weeks.  Such a tender time, when it is easy to retreat from our swirling emotions, and tempting to avoid the difficult theological questions that inevitably arise.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  Where is God’s comfort in the midst of loss?  What’s the future of this church going to look like?  In middle of these tough questions, I have noticed, that many of you have been sharing your inner experience of all this with one another:  in our First Hour adult faith formation discussion, at choir rehearsal and Women’s Fellowship, youth group and in our Executive Board meetings, in Tuesday morning Bible study, Pastoral Search Committee, in our book study of Richard Rohr’s “Divine Dance” about the Trinity.  \\n\\tWhat’s exciting about this is how I see you all working out an important part of your Mission statement together, as you grapple with these very difficult realities of loss.   Take a look at the back of your bulletin.  As a congregation, you have affirmed that God is calling you to become seekers and servants, growing in God’s transforming love.  And you have articulated that you going to become that kind of church by taking the public risk of being a visible “demonstration plot” for God’s presence on earth.  What I notice happening right now is how you all have been digging deep into the strategy, or “how to” statements 1 and 2.  How do we be that “demonstration plot” for the world to see and experience?   Oddly enough these two statement seem linked for me, and I have the sense we have to do #2 to make #1 happen.  If I am not tending to my own “inner transformation” through spiritual practices of prayer, scripture soaking, being kind and compassionate of others, forgiving others and myself, and opening to God’s still-speaking voice…..well, it’s pretty hard to offer much of a welcome to others to do the same thing.  Following a study group this last week, one of you mentioned to me that you had experienced a tremendous loss in another congregation, and no one wanted to talk about it.  This person marveled at how many of you have shared openly and even tearfully about how recent tragedy and losses have rattled you, brought up your own losses, thrown you into tough questions about God’s presence…..that vulnerability, that openness changes each of us as we carefully listen and share together.  We start to go deeper with one another.  Somehow I find myself feeling more kindly towards someone when they share vulnerability with me about their sadness or fear.  In my own life my hardened heart begins to soften as someone shares about their own mistakes, their own regrets.  Forgiveness and openness more readily well up inside of me.  I start to to become more vulnerable, to change at some deep level, as I experience these thin fillaments of connection.  And I realize this is what Jesus was talking about…..the work of the Advocate, the Comforter, the Spirit…..flowing between each of us, between us and those who are far away, between us and those who have died before us.\\n\\tAt the same time, I notice you all talking together about really extending this unconditional welcome, described in statement #1, out into the community.  You affirmed expanding your Open and Affirming statement in January pledging that you will not only welcome, but support and advocate for the LGBTQ community.  Members of the Outreach Ministry Team have taken on the specifics, and for starters, bought a bunch of these playful little rainbow comma pins.  Rainbow for the LGBTQ symbol of welcome; comma for the “don’t put a period where God has put a comma; God is still speaking” and start to wear them around town.  We’ve got our elevator speech about how our church welcomes all, printed on welcome cards, and extra pins to carry with us when people ask about what we are wearing.  And they will! (Grab a few from the bowl in the front lobby as you leave – extend that welcome!).  Others of us decide to take a leap and sign up to visit the local mosque down near the Fairgrounds during Ramadan.   Starting May 26 this year, Ramadan begins a month day-light hour fasting and self-reflection for observant Muslims.  We’ll join them in eating a traditional “Iftar” dinner after the sun sets on May 30, getting to know some of our Muslim neighbors as they break their daily fast.   How might our views of Muslims and Islam change in this one encounter?  What might happen next for this congregation as we seek deeper mutual understanding, perhaps work together on service projects that affect our community?  We don’t know.  But I sense a willingness among you to allow these kind of encounters to transform your own preconceptions and assumptions.  I find this to be a hopeful sign of your growing well-being and vitality as a congregation.  \\n\\tIn the days and years ahead, it will not just been intellectual discussions about God that revitalize this church.  It will be your openness to ongoing encounters with God that will transform you.  It will be vulnerable discussions with others about how you each are experiencing the movement of the Spirit in your lives, that will draw you more closely together.  That shared intimacy, that growing trust, will impel you to welcome others even more openly and actively.    For this Advocate, this Counselor, this Spirit that moves within and around us, making all this possible, I give thanks.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tWhen we are very young, life is almost entirely about receiving.  To survive, we must receive food and shelter; to begin to thrive we need cuddling and encouragement, consistent love and consistent discipline.  We just soak it in.  We receive naturally.  People usually respond well to our smiles, to our learning how to use a spoon and the bathroom, not biting our sister, so we start to give…alittle.  But when we are young, it is about receiving, and Christmas mostly seems that way.  It’s about receiving presents.  Our Christmas lists are not usually what we will give other people.  Yes, yes, there is something else about a Baby Jesus born in a chilly manger with stinky animals long ago.  But the big deal is waiting for and then receiving PRESENTS!\\n\\tThen we get a bit older, and we might learn to make something in school for a parent, a beloved guardian.  Slowly, we learn the both the joy and hassle of trying to find a perfect gift with whatever money and time we have.  We get older and realize this is the Big Deal for most of our culture:  its on the TV, all over the internet, the radio:  Buy!  Bigger!  Better!  Buy!  Make the people you love happy!!  And we may get even more perplexed about how this connects to the Baby in the manger.  Though it does seem to relate to being generous, loving others as you love yourself.  Helping others who don’t have much in the way of food, shelter, clothing, toys.  The kind of things grown-up Jesus taught.   \\n\\tSo as grown-ups, unless we got stuck acting like a kid in a grown-up body, we know it is all about GIVING, NOT RECEIVING.  Of course there is in all of us that self-focused little boy or girl inside of us who wants the big toys.  Be it gigantic flat-screen TV, an iPod, trip to a spa or that fancy vacation.  But most of the time, we remember that it is better to give than receive.  Grown-ups GIVE.  That’s what they do.  End of story.\\n\\tReally?  I don’t think so.  Let’s return to the Christmas story.  Even with all the noisy angelic host, there is something strangely quiet and humble, about this story.  In other stories in the Bible, like Moses and escaping Pharoh’s slavery in Egypt, Noah building an ark, God liberates and saves the chosen people by enlisting and prodding them.  But here, in strange story of God risks birthing through a young unmarried woman a baby in stable in an out-of-the-way place.  Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, the wisemen, they themselves take a risk as all receivers of a gift.  And we, as followers of the adult Jesus, are invited to risk being fully out of this simple story.  The mystery of God’s renewing presence among us, over and over, is something we RECEIVE.  \\n\\tThere is a lot of adult comfort in being a GIVER.  It gives us a certain power, independence and control.  We name the time, the gift, the receipient.    How different from being a follower of the adult Jesus, where we willingly come empty-handed, humbly allowing another force besides our smarts and accomplishments to guide us.  \\nAnd here is the real challenge of Christmas for us grown-ups.  We have to learn to be receivers.   Children, their job is to learn to be givers.  A few adults still need to work on this too.  But for most grown-ups, I would say the big challenge found in the Christmas story is that we need to learn to loosen our grip a tad and learn to be RECEIVERS again.  \\n\\tAnd the best presents may not come in wrapped boxes…the challenge for followers of Jesus is to learn to risk receiving love, someone’s trust in us.   To receive someone’s forgiveness.  To finally acknowledge and live as though we are not each a solo act.   To receive the mystery of connection beween us and the God of the universe. \\nReceiving as a child….learning to give as an adult….opening to receive gifts of love and hope, letting them be born in us.   Thanks be to God for such challenges and gifts.  Merry Christmas.  Amen.\\n\\nThe Risk of Birth \\n by Madeleine L’Engle (1973) \\n \\nThis is no time for a child to be born, \\nWith the earth betrayed by war & hate \\nAnd a nova lighting the sky to warn \\nThat time runs out & the sun burns late. \\n \\nThat was no time for a child to be born, \\nIn a land in the crushing grip of Rome; \\nHonour & truth were trampled by scorn- \\nYet here did the Savior make his home. \\n \\nWhen is the time for love to be born? \\nThe inn is full on the planet earth, \\nAnd by greed & pride the sky is torn- \\nYet Love still takes the risk of birth. \\n \\n\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\tBack when I first arrived as your interim pastor, about 2 years ago, I told a story in the Children’s Time about my dad.  Actually it was a story about a story he would tell us when we were kids.  The story of an ant named Mr. Jelly Bean.  According to my dad, Mr. Jelly Bean traveled with my dad, which meant he travelled a lot.  My dad was captain of different ships in the Navy and his ships went out into the ocean a lot to help protect our country.  Which meant he was gone from us a lot, and we missed him a lot.  Dad would tell stories about Mr. Jelly Bean hiding in his briefcase and then crawling out into his cabin on ship.  Mr. Jelly Bean would sometimes get seasick on board, but would mostly hang out and nibble on the lemon drops in the little candy tin we gave my Dad.  Somehow, Mr. Jelly Bean always knew when the ship was nearing port, would crawl into my dad’s tan briefcase and come home to us and have some adventures at our house for awhile.  Did we ever see Mr. Jelly Bean?  No.  Were these true stories?  I tell you what was true:  Me and my brother and sister needed to know a part of us went with my dad each time he left.  Mr. JB was a part of our family.  The true part is that we were all connected and that Dad and Mr. JB would come back to us.   I think Dad told us this story to help us understand that mysterious unseen connection we had that stretched across the ocean.\\n\\tToday we have a story that people told in Bible times to help explain another mysterious thing:  why do bad things, evil things, happen? when bad things happen, does that mean God made it happen? that God is punishing us?   We aren’t too worried about bad things happening to mean, cruel evil people.  But it really bugs us when bad things happen to someone who is kind, generous, loving.  Someone good.  What’s up with THAT?\\n\\n\\tThe Bible has lots of different stories that describe the way God acts with humans.  Different stories written by diferent people at different times.  Sometimes the stories say that God rewards people who are good and punish people who are bad.  And some of the stories say No, that is not how things work in the world.  Jesus didn’t seem to think God punished people like this either.  Think for yourself for a minute:  Those of you who came out to the Family Bingo the other night:  did just the good people win at Bingo or the Tricky Tray?  Did the bad, the naughty people not win at all?  Is that how the world works? Sometimes when I visit people who are sick, one of them will say to me:  Pastor Anne, I guess I am sick because I did something bad.  Well, you can get sick from eating the wrong foods or sitting outsides in the rain all day.  But sometimes bad things happen even if we do everything right.  and none of us is perfect!  But Good people get in car accidents, they get sick, they loose their jobs even though they may have been good and kind and loving.  And the weird thing is that bad people who are mean and cheat and hurt people….well, they sometimes end up very healthy, they live a long time and get a pile of money.  \\n\\tI tell you, it just doesn’t seem fair!  It doesn’t make sense!  People have wondered about this for a very long time.\\n\\tToday’s Bible reading is a story was written by someone long ago who wondered:  why do awful things happen to good people?  Now this was written as a make-believe story in a make-believe town called Uz.  “There once was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.”  Now this story gets alittle strange and gruesome, so it is important to remember it is a made-up story written to tell us something about people and something about God.  I think it got included in the Bible because it talks about this hard question:  why do bad things happen to good people.\\n\\tReady?  Once upon a time in the faraway land of Uz there was a man named Job.  That man was very good, blameness and upright; he worshipped God  and turned away from all evil.  He also had a huge farm, money, a wife and lots of kids.  Life was great for Job but he never forgot to pay attention to God, to thank God and worship God. \\n\\tTwo scenes in this story – goes back and forth.  Job and life with humans.  Side conversation between God and some heavenly hosts.  \\n\\tOne day God was hanging out with all the heavenly hosts, including one angel called Satan.  Actually this was not the Devil like we think of him now, someone working against God’s plans.  The Angel named Satan had a special role in heaven, sort of like an investigator.  In this story he investigates human and presents a different point of view to God.  He was simply called the adversary or accuser.  Maybe he was there to bring a little perspective to the heavenly hosts.  A different point of view.  Anyway, Satan couldn’t act on his own; but he could only suggest things to God.\\n\\tSo God asks Satan the investigating angel:  what’s up?  Where you been?  And Satan  says, “Glad you asked….I’ve been walking around on earth….interesting place you made there!”  And God  said:  “yes isn’t it.  Humans are amazing.  Have you noticed my faithful follower Job? That guy is awesome; so faithful and righteous.  A really good man.”  And Satan replied, “I wonder if he would be such a faithful follower and so amazing if some bad things started happening to him….like if his house and farm was destroyed and his children died.”   And God said, “hmmmmm…..I wonder.  Go ahead and see for yourself….test him a little bit, but don’t go too far.   “I’m on it,” says Satan.\\n\\tWhoa!  Wait a minute!  What kind of God is this?  Go bug one of my good people just to see if he still will be a faithful person?    And in the story, Satan goes to earth and destroys Job’s farm all his property and then he kills his children!  Satan goes back to God and says, “let’s see how far we can push this; I know I can make him curse you!”  God says, “okay, but don’t kill him.”  And Job gets really sick with sores all over his body; he sits on an ash-heap scratching himself.  Miserable!  His wife says to him, “isn’t it about time to blame somebody here?  You should blame God.  You should CURSE God.”  We all like to blame somebody else, don’t we?  “No, I will not curse God,” says Job, “we receive both good and bad from the hand of God.”  \\n\\tWell, the story goes on from here.  Some of Jobs friends come and sit with him.  They actually sit quietly with him along time, which is pretty sweet.  Sometimes when we are really sad or hurting, it helps a lot to just have someone sit with us quietly.  Not saying anything.  But after several days of this, his friends can’t figure out why such a good person has had so many problems.  They start asking: “what did you do, Job?  Why is God punishing you?”  They eventually go away with no answer.  Job hasn’t done anything wrong.\\n\\tJob finally runs out of patience and blows up at God.  WHY am I suffering, he demands.  And suddenly there is a big whoosh of wind and then dead silence….then God asks Job a question:  were you around when I created all this?  Do you know how the stars and the moon and sun got in the sky?  Can you send out lighting and make storms come?   Did you create all the animals and humans?  Job, this is my world….not yours.   I am here.  And some things are mysterious.  I am here.  I made you.  I am speaking to you.” “Wow,” says Job very quietly.  “You’re right.  God you are pretty awesome.  And mysterious.  And you are here with me.  Thank you.”\\n\\tIn this story I am reminded that the bad that happens to us is not punishment.  Sometimes its my fault and other times bad things just happen in this world.  Storms come, bodies get sick, people die.  This is not God’s punishment.  \\n\\tAnd good things are not because I am getting rewarded by God.  God is not Santa Claus, giving us presents if we are good.  Sometimes good things just happen in the world.  This is a mysterious thing and we do well to wonder about it all our lives.  And through it all God is talking to us, listening to us, caring for us.  Sort of like Mr. Jelly Bean who was always there with my dad when he was away from us.  \\n\\tI’m glad for stories.  They help me understand this mysterious and wonderful world alittle better.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tOn the surface, we can say we are entertained for an hour, if we enjoy the music genre and performance.  But we know that worship isn’t just a spectator sport.  What makes us so invested in different styles of music, debating and even arguing about the music we share in worship?  Something else is happening in us, in our connection with God and one another, for music to be so important. I think we each have a sense of how music puts us in touch with various emotions, feelings, and even intuitive imaginings.  What does this have to do with our sense of connection with the spirit of the living God that both reaches to the farthest galaxy and also dwells within each of us?\\t\\n\\tThese questions have led me to wondering: is music a way of communicating with God, of actually praying?   I asked both Joel and Karen to write me something about how music has deepened their sense of connection with God through the years.  Karen noted that it has been so meaningful and satisfying for her to know “that the organ supports and inspires our human spirit through the hymns that we sing in both joy and sorry.”  Reading this, I thought of how the repetition, the on-going-ness, the persistence of our singing over the years puts us in touch with our often hidden emotions, and can reconnect the fragmented parts of our heart.  Joel put it well when he described how our prayer time together downstairs before the service, as pastor, musicians and choir, deepens his own trust in God’s guidance of our leadership together.  Sometimes even the persistent memory of music shared in a place can stir us deeply.  Joel described how God is also revealed to him in this space, as he sits alone in “the sanctuary late in the afternoon as the setting sun’s rays electrify the stain glass windows amongst the dark shadows.” “Sometimes words aren’t enough,” Joel wrote, when words are “coupled with music, it takes the human experience even higher…it’s then that I’m in tears.”  \\n\\tSo might singing, playing and listening to music be a way that we connect with God, a way that we pray?  Hear these words from the Gospel of Luke: “Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart.”  That’s the author’s set-up for the parable we just heard of a needy widow and an unjust judge.  Jesus has previously given everyone, close followers, bystanders and local religious leaders, an earful with some rather ominous sounding apocalyptic predictions about the end times. His listeners are understandably unnerved, and so he tells them this cautionary story to illustrate how they are to pray always and not loose heart.  What follows is a story about a widow’s persistent requests for justice as she confronts a stubborn official.   Given the trials that lie ahead for Jesus and his followers, Luke tells his readers that this is a parable about the need “to pray always and not to lose heart.”  \\n\\tOkay.  But what might this actually look like in our lives? I would bet that you and I do not consciously pray all the time, every minute of the day.  And when we do pray, we sometimes get frustrated and discouraged.  Don’t lose heart?  Confronted with disappointment and loss in our personal lives, with the current tone and context of our current political campaign, our heart, our courage and gumption, often seems to leaks out of us on a regular basis! \\n\\tJesus’ parable seems to imply if we pester God enough, we will get what we want.  Is this the purpose of prayer?  The feisty widow in the story keeps at it, persistently demanding justice from a judge who neither cares about God nor about his fellow humans.  “How much more will your just and loving God answer your prayers?” Jesus demands of his listeners.  But it’s a contrast story, with almost absurd caricatures:  vulnerable, powerless widow with no legal rights in her society, claiming that she will sock this judge in the eye (literal reading of “wear me out”) and publically embarrass him if he doesn’t hear her case.  A grumpy and arbitrary judge, who by Jewish law is required specifically to defend the rights of orphans and widows, here ignoring the woman’s request for justice in what is probably a financial or property claim.   \\nIf we aren’t careful, we might equate God with the judge in the story. But persistence in the practice of prayer is something different than pestering God for goodies.   We are challenged to persist in praying in a broken world that is filled with fear and despair.  “Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart.”  Daily conversation with God slowly changes both us and the spaces around us.  Not unlike our weekly singing here together, as we lift up songs of praise and gladness, lament and grief, in the middle of what seems to be a hopeless world.  We do this even in the midst of public vitriol, denigrating of women by public figures, in the midst of calls for violence against political opponents.  As we sing and pray together each week, we envision a different kind of world, where the marginalized and those who are abused are lifted up, supported and empowered.  We become like this persistent widow, and we doggedly pursue justice for the marginalized and abused among us.  \\n\\tI travel next week to a preaching conference at Yale Divinity School in Connecticut, where I received my seminary training years ago. One of the presenters at this event is the preaching professor Thomas Troeger, an accomplished flutist and celebrated hymn writer, as well as a seminary teacher at the school.  In preparation, I have been reading one of his books, a series of columns he wrote for the journal The American Organist.   Troeger writes about music in worship, exploring how it  “awakens people to those gifts of the spirit that sustain hope, promote healing, and enliven a visionary faith in the possibility of a transformed world.”  There is something about music in the context of corporate worship with others, that “puts the human heart in touch with the spirit (of God) in times of sorrow and seeking, in times of joy and gratitude.”  (In a recent interview) Troeger described how “he beauty of finely turned verse set to beautiful music is a way of engaging another mode of existence.”  He reminds us that, as the early church theologian St. Augustine described:  when we sing, we are actually praying twice.  I suspect that God delights in both our beautiful melodies and our imperfect singing.   Troeger reminds me that music in worship allows us to stay intellectually engaged while feeling a sense of awe and wonder.  “There is a dimension to life that is not fully knowable simply by our rational capacities. I love reason, I love science, but reason doesn’t explain to me what it feels like to kiss my wife.” *  \\nThere is something about our back and forth exchanges with God, as we express our thanks, singing and praying, our frustrations and our gratefulness, sadness and anger, our wonderings and hopes, that begins to change us.   We find ourselves actually “growing in God’s transforming love,” as our church vision statement encourages us.  We are able to seek truth and serve others in new ways.  It happens with the melodies, harmonies, rhythms, even dissonance, washing over us as we immerse ourselves in music in this sacred space.  We sense a different dimension of life as we enter a stream of words and tunes that others have written.  When we don’t have the words to pray, these words that speak of God’s mercy and justice, of the hope for our future, are here for us, urging us to pray always and not loose heart.  We join in a mighty chorus that started long before us, and sing with all we’ve got.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n  \\n*\\n“Why Listening to Music is Kind of….Like Prayer” Sarah Grant at Wondering Sound.',\n",

       " '\\nBecause I grew up in a Navy family, I spent much of my childhood on the beaches of both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.  The sea was a great source of fascination for me, in part because it held my father’s big grey destroyers when he sailed to foreign lands.  The sea’s waters tossed and churned me, ground me into the sand and left me frightened and sputtering when I miscalculated its the power of its waves.  As a preteen, I spent hours floating up and down over the rolling breakers in the warm southern California sun.  Salty ocean waters were my first independent lessons in a private peacefulness and body sensuality.  I wonder what is your earliest early memory of water.  Thirstily slurping out of a garden hose on a hot summer day?   Watching rocks cast ripples in a lake, as your tossed them from the shore?  Feeling the rush of creek waters against your legs?  Holding your breath under the surface in a warm lake?  Struggling against a powerful wave? \\nNowhere is water a more powerful metaphor than in desert cultures, where the presence of water means life and its absence can spell suffering and death.  A bit of a stretch for us to imagine, here in the land of plenty of humidity, water, jungly kudzu. But it is this desert climate that is the context for Jesus’ ministry and the metaphors he often used to describe himself and God’s reign here among humans. \\n\\tJesus’ world was also the world of Judaism, where the faithful celebrated through sacred story and ritual how their ancestors had wandered through the dry wilderness after fleeing the oppression of slavery in Egypt.   Struggling with an unknown future, and now an occupying military force, they would again and again wonder: “is God really among us, is God with us?”  The Exodus story survives for both Jews and Christians as a reminder that God provides for our elemental needs, and is indeed present in our midst.  This God who parted the watery chaos at creation, sent the Flood, parted the Red Sea, brought water forth from the rocks in the Exodus wilderness, and continues to send rain upon the “just and the unjust.” The coming of the Kingdom of God was imagined as a time not only when people where freed and healed, but when waters would “break forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.” (Isaiah) \\nToday’s passage from the Gospel of John finds Jesus in Jerusalem, a city which had to make repeated and complicated efforts to maintain a fresh water supply for its people.  Jesus and his followers are in the city for the Feast of Tabernacles, what was also known as the Festival of Booths or Succoth. Originally a harvest celebration, the observance had deepened in theological significance.  By Jesus time, it had become identified with the wilderness journey after the Israelites escaped from Egypt, and is continues to be celebrated by Jews around the world, today, falling after Yom Kippur during their High Holy Days each fall.  During the time of the great Temple in Jerusalem, the religious and ritual center for the people, Jews would make a pilgrimage to the great metropolis.  During this particular festival, they would build hut-like structures, or booths, throughout the city streets, symbolic of those used by the Israelites in the wilderness.  People would decorate them with harvest produce, eat and often sleep in them for week in remembrance of their sojourn through the wilderness. Near the end of Succoth, the Festival of Booths, the priests would go to the Pool of Siloam, which was a freshwater reservoir that supplied the city water.  Accompanied by musicians and dancers, the priests would draw water and, returning through the Water Gate of the city, they would then pour the water over the Temple altar.  Libation and a sign of God’s graciousness in a dry land.\\nIt is in this context that Jesus makes this rather startling self-proclamation.  Perhaps he was watching this procession of priests carrying the water back to the Temple.  Suddenly, Jesus announces: “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in me drink.”  Jesus is claiming that he himself manifests, incarnates, all the blessings in their tradition which relate to water:  miraculous outdoor springs that save the people from death; inner springs that are the movement of God in one’s personal depths, an ever-renewed and mysterious upwelling of full life within us.  Who IS this presumptuous person?\\nJesus had already spoken of himself as the one who provides “living water,” a phrase with double meaning signifying both fresh, running water as well as water that is healing and life-giving.  One of the most beloved stories in our Christian tradition is that of Jesus talking with the foreigner, a Samaritan woman at a well, where a request for a cool drink turns into a profound exchange about “living water.”  Jesus says to her: “The water that I will give will become in (the thirsty) as a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” \\nJesus wanted people to understand that God’s power is always accessible to us, like the rush of living water that seems to come out of nowhere.  This makes me wonder:  How might this everyday element of the natural world be my touchstone, my reminder, of the on-going presence of the Risen Jesus Christ?  Of God’s presence and wider perspective in my life?  This substance is so available, so very close and common, that I can easily miss moment-by-moment opportunities to engage it in spiritual practice.  Could our interacting with water be a daily way to replenish our very partnership with God?      \\nNo matter what our childhood or later life experiences, we each have been held in that safe, watery darkness of living waters, an imprint on our bodies and deep in our soul, of quiet and being held.  Our bodies are made of water, and before we ever saw the light of day, we each soaked in embryonic waters.  Sometimes when I awaken in the night from a disturbing dream or can’t return to sleep as I ruminate my to-do list, I prayerfully imagine myself floating in God’s universal womb of dark.  Quiet, safe, paying attention to my breath.  Often, the anxious part of myself calms and feels held.  In the restless dark hours, a deepened sense of being accompanied by the Mystery, the source of these living waters, that I call God.      \\nRecently, I learned that over one billion people around the world routinely consume unhealthy water; I take for granted relatively safe water flowing from our taps.   Globally, over five million people will die this year from polluted water, as individual governments, the United Nations, various non-governmental organizations and many religious service groups will struggle to bring water justice to needy places.  I wonder, what might God be calling us to in those moments, as we sip the clear, cool liquid?  How might we start to think differently about our individual and collective relationships with this precious resource? What small piece of water conservation or water advocacy might beckon to us in the coming days?  Perhaps each drink of daily water can be a spiritual practice in wondering aloud, “God what would you have me do next to help save this part of our precious planet?” \\nFinally, we hear Jesus say “out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water” and I wonder:  who might need the cool, cleansing waters of my simple, non-judgmental attention today?  How might “living water” flow out of each of our hearts to others more consistently?  As we wash and drink water each day, we might reflect on where we will spread the “living waters” of our loving attention.  How might “living water” of compassionate listening flow from each of us?  \\nPerhaps water can become a daily touchstone for us, reminding and reinforcing what we ponder in our hearts:  That there is an abundance of love and acceptance; there are overflowing streams of forgiveness and hope.  Thanks be to God!  “Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water,” said Jesus. And so may it be for each of us.  Amen.',\n",
       " \"\\tAs I moved around in our scriptures texts this week, I found myself humming a snippet of a tune, repeating a refrain I couldn’t quite place:  “you gotta serve somebody” round and round in my head.   The Israelite leader Joshua at Schehem admonishing the ancient Jewish tribes:  “choose this day whom you will serve.”  Last week we read of how Jesus watched a group of his disciples abandon him in their confusion and disbelief. Jesus was speaking eating his body and blood, of taking into themselves the way of suffering and death as his followers. And Apostle Paul here in Ephesians:  pleading with the early church to stand firm against the rulers and authorities who partnered with the comic powers of this present darkness, “put on the whole armor of God so you can stand against the wiles of the devil.”  Choose to stand firm against the powers and the principalities, the powers of evil!  Texts about choices, about who and what we are willing to serve and follow.   Now what was that tune I kept humming?   A quick internet search and I found it:\\nYou may be an ambassador to England or France,\\n\\nYou may like to gamble, you might like to dance,\\n\\nYou may be the heavyweight champion of the world,\\n\\nYou may be a socialite with a long string of pearls\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\\n                     \\nYou're gonna have to serve somebody,\\n      \\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody.\\n\\nBob Dylan in the late 1970’s.  Echoing, probably unintentionally at that point in his life, the ancient Biblical theme about ultimate allegiance which guides daily decisions.   Uncannily, Dylan hits the issue spot-on:  Whoever you are, you often unwittingly serve a power you do not intend to support.  “You don’t think you have to consciously chose?” Dylan taunts.  Think again. \\nThe author of the Book of Joshua describes events that happened many years before, as the Hebrew people settled into the promised land around their first holy site of Schehem. Over the centuries of Israel’s existence this passage became part of a regularly repeated covenant ritual.  Leaders would gather the people and recount the saving deeds of God, the history of salvation.  This was especially important during times of tragedy and displacement, when it is natural to forget who or what we are truly serving.  The people would be reminded that God had chose them for a special purpose of being a light of justice and hope for all the nations:  ‘I am the Lord who brought you out of Egypt…”  Their leader Joshua confronts them with their ambivalence, their hemming and hawing about whether or not they will be faithful to the God who has been faithful to them.  “Well, it may be the gods of your ancestors served in the region beyond the River, well, it may be the Amorites or it may be the Lord, but you are going have to serve somebody.”  \\nAs I’ve watched and read the news about the current political campaigns and debates, I’ve thought about how this daily choosing impacts the way we make decisions in the public square.  Do I choose to serve my fears?  Am I guided by “what’s in it for me” or am I serving a wider compassion that seeks what is good for my neighbor and our nation as a whole?  Not just my next door neighbor with whom I am familiar, but my stranger neighbor?   Our ability to even listen to one another with civility is affected by this choice of who and what we serve.\\nThe apostle Paul would say that we are strengthened and guided in this daily choosing not by being strong ourselves, but by being “strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.”  I’m afraid this really grates against much of what many of us have been taught.  Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, don’t look for hand-outs, be tough, be strong.  We teach our kids to be responsible by talking this way.  We don’t want them to be slackers or lazy or dependent on others.  But the Bible appears to have another way of going about this process of strength and good choosing.  “Put on the whole armor of God, so that you all (not just individual you, it’s plural in the original Greek) “may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”  I have always found this to be a difficult teaching.  First of all, I personally am put-off by the militaristic language.  I have never liked singing hymns with militaristic imagery, like “Onward Christian Soliders,” “Solidiers of Christ Arise,” “Stand up for Jesus, you soldiers of the Cross.”  It reminds me of the sad and gruesome reality that ever since Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, under Constantine’s rule in the 4th century, Christians have been harassing, torturing and slaughtering people under the banner of Jesus Christ.  Jews, Muslims, heretics, witches, native American Indians, Catholics, even Protestants with the wrong beliefs.  The list goes miserably on and on.  In the words of one Biblical commentator on this passage: “In the Christian tradition, the notion of warfare against spiritual forces has been often shifted to justify wars against particular others, who are named ‘enemies of God’ and ‘forces of evil.’” (Haruko Nawata Ward, Feasting on the Word, Year B, Volume 3, page 378.)  I personally want nothing to do with this militaristic imagery.\\n\\tAnd yet, whom do I serve?  What do my daily choices say about whom or what I serve?  What would really look like in my life, in your life, if we could say “I serve God.”  ?  Or put in specifically Christian terms: “I follow Jesus, that is how I serve God.” ?   As much as I don’t like it, part of what this passage from Ephesians does is it helps me get real in a real world.  The Canadian Biblical scholar, Marva Dawn, has written about this passage that as Christians, we live an embattled life.  Put another way, there are many enemies of God’s grace.  God’s justice and compassion for the weak and vulnerabily has enemies.  There are people in our private and public lives who would rather make accusations and distort the truth through lies and secrecy, by driving a wedge of fear and suspicion.  It happens in our homes, it happens at work, it happens in congregations and community groups.  And to confront this, Paul uses this metaphor of armor of the most successful military of its time: the Roman army.  Known for their ability to stand firm, in rank, and drive a wedge between opposing forces.  Take up the shield of faith, of trusting God, says Paul.  Roman shields were an incredible invention.  They were huge, covering the body of the one who held it, as well as 1/3 of the body of the soldier next to him.  Standing firm together, it created an inpenitrable wall against opposing forces.   This is not about being strong as an individual, but standing strong with others in the faith, in the church.\\n\\tWhat might be the forces of evil that we can oppose if we choose to stand together as the Christian church?   In the past, Christians have stood up and stood firm against evils such as slavery, war, poverty, segregation.  In the coming months and years, where will this church choose to stand up, stand firm and stand together?   It is so easy, natural even, to get side-tracked with worries about not causing conflict and splits, pleasing certain parts of the membership, avoiding speaking the truth together about what is important.  \\nWe often avoid putting on much of this armor in the church.  The “belt of truth” gets set aside.  The “breastplate of righteousness,” or right, healthy relations is ignored.  \\n\\tI think it all has to do with choices.  Our daily choosing between this or that.  Our praying “in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication.”  Our deciding whether or not to take on this armor of God.  Our choosing whether or not to “stay alert” as Paul cautions.  It has to do with where we put our attention, our dollars, our time, our daydreams, our appetites, our energies, even our hopes.  I suggest we each do some tracking this week – as decisions arise and choices face each of us – who am I serving here?  Am I clothing myself in God’s strength and armor?  Consider the call in this 19th century hymn:\\nStand up, stand up for Jesus, stand in His strength alone;\\u2028\\nThe arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own.\\u2028\\nPut on the Gospel armor, each piece put on with prayer;\\u2028\\nWhere duty calls or danger, be never wanting there.\\n\\tIt’s this grace-given gift of the armor of the living God, that we are invited to choose.  May we choose to be “strong in the Lord and in the strength of God’s power” together.  Amen.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"For starters, I find that the Gospel of John is a good antidote to an over-abundance of Christmas sweetness and baby stories.  This is in part because the Gospel of John includes nothing about the tender birth narratives of Jesus.  All those place-and-people oriented details that the other Gospel writers, Matthew and Luke, reveled in?  Augustus and Herod, weird pregnancy announcements, long journeys, the shabby stable, shepherds freaking-out, foreign astrologer priests trudging after a star?  “Limits the scope!” I can hear the author John muttering to himself. \\n\\t\\tSo what does he do in his Gospel that is different from the other three?  John unhinges us from the narrative detail and goes prehistoric and cosmic at the same time.  I find this startling but refreshing. I’m grateful the Bible includes such diverse stories about Jesus’ origin and purpose, and that our tradition honors our individual choices in this matter.  John’s context as he explores “who is this Jesus” -?  As a scholarly Hellenist of around 100 CE, John is writing in Greek for his Greek speaking Jewish Christian community, under Roman domination, in Jerusalem.  “,In the beginning was the Word,” he writes, riffing off the creation story in the Hebrew scriptures from Genesis, where God speaks the universe into being.  But John gives creation a new twist: Instead of “In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,” John writes, “in the beginning was the Logos” – a familiar word in Greek philosophy meaning both “logic” and also an animating energy.  Life energy of the universe, there in the beginning of all things. This life energy, this logos, this word, has become flesh, John will unfold.  Not an abstract philosophical formulation, but flesh!  Certainly a challenging, even ridiculous, notion for any good Hellenist…..who would insist on the tidy separation between fallible bodies/debased matter and the elevated spiritual world. \\n\\t\\tBut John’s community was also filled with Hebrew speaking Jewish Christians.  The “Word” – dabar in Hebrew – also meant the Torah – their holy Law – believed also to be an animating force that existed at the beginning of creation and as co-creator with God.  Jewish listeners would be reminded of lady Wisdom, of the spirit of the Torah.  They would hear these echoes from the Book of Sirach, Wisdom “coming forth from the mouth of the Most High” and “covering the earth like a mist.”\\nJohn is juggling a lot here, seeking to describe an indescribable mystery of God made flesh in Jesus.  Hear his repeating, tumbling litany:\\n\\nIn the beginning   In the beginning  - a time before time, eternal time?  The Cosmic Word appearing with a capital W.  Yet eternal!  There from the beginning.  Speaking, calling out, creating, making it so.\\nMore repetition     WordWordWord.\\nGodGodGod – the name God repeated eight times.  This story is not really about Jesus, the Gospel writer seems to be urging.  It’s about God!\\nBeingbeing.  LifeLife.   Creation keeps springing forth.  \\nAnd there is….. Darkness! – one reference.  The image then vanishes into the whoosh of repeating brightness -  Light Light Light Light Light Light….   \\nAnd then…..WorldWorldWorldWorld  - eternal Word with a capital W coming into the temporal World  - two realms colliding, inter-penetrating, co-existant.  Always. Forever and ever.\\nBelieve believe! – absorb this, trust this, we are urgently invited.\\nFlesh Flesh, the author tries to clarify.   Familial language: Only Son   Only Son\\nThen almost shouting, full of Grace and Truth!    \\nThis Jesus, see him and see God, the writer seems to groan.  Hear him and hear God. Grace upon grace. Grace on grace on grace.\\nAnd finally:  This is the one.  Close to the Creator’s heart.\\n\\nThis stuff shakes me out of my post-holiday stupor of rich food, revelry and gloomies.  I picture animating primordial energy, exploding across the cosmos.  Like stardust from the Big Bang, this energy settles on my skin, sinks into me, flows in my veins.  No, wait, new image, a Cook County friendly image! The Life Energy of the Universe makes a dwelling, a tent, and camps out with us in the everydayness of our lives.  And, oddly enough, within this metaphorical whirlwind, John makes the curious claim that the Word, Christ, actually exists before the human Jesus is born.  The apostle Paul will later write in one of his letters, Jesus Christ is the very one “in whom all things hold together.” (Col. 1:15-20)  Cosmic Christ, cosmic glue?  \\n\\t\\tI’m already on overload but wait there is more! This Word – it shines!  It comes as light.   It is not overcome by any darkness.  And this is what may be so counter-cultural about the Gospel message, in a world like as ours filled with such darkness.  A world filled with such imperfection, so seemingly broken.   Whatever happens with the infusion of the Cosmic Christ, it does not take away the darkness.  This radiance shines in the darkness.  \\n\\t\\tIt was the contemporary poet and song-writer Leonard Cohen who wrote:\\n\\nRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering\\nThere is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\\nFrom Anthem,\\xa0Leonard Cohen, 1934 – 2016\\n\\t“There is a crack in everything.”  Well, yes.  And don’t we know it, deep down in the quiet of the night when we can’t sleep, in the disappointments of missed connections at family gatherings, the sense of inadequacy or resentment or guilt or whatever that overwhelms us even when we try our hardest.  We attempt our “perfect offerings” and sometimes they are successful.  But many times those “perfect offerings” are presented by a mask of who we think we should be…., not the real vulnerable cracked us who is connected to all the other vulnerable people with cracks. I sense we are all cracked-up in one way of the other.  Perhaps our post-Christmas challenge is to pay attention to how the adult Jesus will encounter people at the places where they were cracking – blindness, debilitating illness, people who were paralyzed by fear, shame and hopelessness.  Jesus will move also into the cracks between the acceptable people and the marginalized people….between religious rulers, the wealthy, the political elite and those living in poverty, the outcast, the powerless. Jesus was never looking for perfection….He looked for the cracks of vulnerability where people might receive him….where the light of healing and reconciliation can get in.  Will we move closer towards revealing those cracks? Might it be possible that through the cracks of our vulnerability, transformation, change can happen?  I sense that the spirit of the Cosmic Christ is looking for those cracks in us still.  \\nRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering.\\nThere is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\\nIn this cracked, messy and beautiful world our job is to respond to the Living Word that has moved into and is present in all of it.   Jesus is close to the Creator’s heart, says the Gospel writer, and is our guide to God’s workings among us.  “How it all works” is revealed to us as we keep our eye on Jesus this coming year.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\",\n",
       " '\\nI have often thought of the Sunday after Easter as the big “Now What?” in the Christian Church.  The celebratory fanfare of Easter is over and all my Easter chocolate has been consumed.  Jesus has risen from the dead, we boldly proclaim!  We are right to ask “now what,” or even “so what?   Life around does not appear very resurrected.   We are in a world of mixed realities: cherry blossoms finally blooming, the relief of spring is coming…and we know the world continues to be a dangerous place where we misue our planet, we allow escalating violence and where we tolerate increasingly bifurcated and hostile world views.   I am reminded of this essential paradox of the Easter message:  Christ has risen and the world continues to struggle with evil and human violence.  \\nThe continuing Easter story from the Gospel of John describes how, after discovering the empty tomb, the disciples of Jesus have basically gone into hiding.  Just before this reading, we do have the account of Mary Magdalene actually stumbling upon the Risen Jesus in a garden outside the tomb and mistaking him for a gardener.  But when she finally recognizes the stranger as her beloved Teacher and Lord, the conversation between the two is painfully quick and she is left to try and explain all of this to the understandably skeptical disciples.  \\nAt this point in the John’s narrative, it is the “evening on that day.”  Jesus’ disciples are now worried that the religious authorities will come after them too, as them have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.   It’s important to note, however, that most Biblical scholars see this phrase “for fear of the Jews” in John’s Gospel as not being about Jesus relation with his own tradition and more an anachronistic reflection.  Hostility towards the Jews of Jesus time in John’s Gospel is a reflection of the later first century tension between John’s Hellenistic gentile Christian community and the local synagogues.  We hear echoes of this tension in the reading from Acts, where several of the disciples are being tried by the Jewish court in Jerusalem for their continued proselytizing in Jesus’ name.  Negative statements about “the Jews” in these two texts refer to the religious leadership in first century Palestine, only.   Negative generalizations about subsequent Jewish communities became the origin of the ancient and deadly lie about “Christ-killers” and eventual persecution of Jews by Christians.  This is particularly germane as today is Holocaust Remembrance Day, observed around the world as Yom HaSho’ah.  As Christians, we do well to reflect on the longstanding anti-Semitism fueled by the Christian Church through the ages that provided a mindset in which the killing of 6 million Jews was even possible.   \\nThat evening, after the discovery of the empty tomb, the men and women disciples sat together behind locked doors.   They shared food they probably could not taste and conversation that heightened their despair.  Suddenly, a stranger appears before them.  “Peace be with you,” says the stranger in greeting, a conventional greeting perhaps meant to remind them of Jesus’ promised gift of peace at the Last Supper.  But no, they really don’t have a clue and remain astonished and confused.  What ever we make of these stories, what is curious is that the disciples do not recognize this stranger as Jesus until he shows them the wounds in his hands and side.  They are in hiding, feeling anxious, victimized, wounded by grief, themselves.  But then they see Jesus’ wounds.  \\nThis is significant change of perspective, says Rowan Williams, writes the former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, in his book Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel.   He describes how we ourselves may identify with Jesus’ sufferings on the cross and are “consoled at the thought that of God sharing in our suffering” through Jesus sufferings (p. 69).  However, “it is precisely when Christ’s sufferings and mine are brought intimately together that the image of the crucified is indeed in danger of degradation,” Williams continues.  If we don’t be careful, we loose track of the real suffering of others.  “We (may) experience ourselves as sufferers, as victims,” continues Williams, “and so experience Christ’s cross as the symbol of who and what we are.  Jesus as victim is the image of myself as victim” (p. 69-70).\\nThe problem with this line of identification, says Williams, is that it can quickly lead to us thinking, “my suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.” This attitude can lead to another more pernicious stance, where “nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.  It also may lead to the kind of hostile rhetoric that often permeates debate in both congregations and the political arena. \\nLest we point fingers, Williams includes most of us in this propensity to secure a righteous position for ourselves:  We find ourselves standing over and against the other, wearing the “moral armor of innocence” and often making ourselves the innocent victims in a given situation.  “Holy Week may invite us to a certain identification with the crucified,” concludes Williams, (but) “Easter firmly takes away a familiar ‘fellow-sufferer.’  Be it ongoing anti-Semitism in today’s world, continued devastation of our planet or blaming others for church and family problems: It is so easy to slip into this “moral armor of innocence.”\\nThe disciples encounter the Risen Jesus and are faced with the fact of their lack of innocence.  They are confronted with their own culpability, their own passive participation in the violence that caused his death.  And they are faced with someone they don’t initially recognize, so caught up in their past actions and inactions, their sense of suffering and hopelessness.  “Easter,” says Rowan Williams, “means coming to the memory of Jesus, looking for consolation, and finding a memory that hurts and judges, that sets a distance, even an alienation between me and hope, my Savior.  Easter occurs, again and again, in this open-up of a void, the sense of absence which questions our egocentric aspirations and our longing for ‘tidy drama’; it occurs when we find in Jesus not a dead friend but a living stranger.” (p. 74)\\nAnd surprisingly, the stranger, the one we now recognize as the Risen Lord, again says:  “Peace be with you.  As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  So much is happening so quickly for his friends and followers.  He is not angry with them; he approaches them with a steady openness and compassionate words.  He breathes on them:  here John uses an unusual form of the verb “to breath.”  Similar to that used when God breathes life into humans in the Genesis creation story, Jesus breath animates, enlivens, brings the disciples back from death. Slowly it dawns on the people in the room, men and women alike, that Jesus has forgiven them.  He holds no grudge or resentment about their passive betrayal of him.  There, in his presence, they are not just remembering their dead friend but are now experiencing a living person.  One who is not quite the one they knew; he is yet a stranger.  He speaks again:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”  Would this be making any sense if they themselves were not experiencing Jesus’ love and forgiveness of their sorry selves, right in that moment?\\nAs the Church, we do not just form an institution to perpetuate the memory of a first century holy man’s deeds and words.  We are the community in Jesus name; this is the part that got the disciples in trouble with the authorities.  “Stop using that name!  Don’t heal and teach in the name of Jesus!”  But the early disciples found themselves approached and forgiven by the presence of our Risen Lord.  We are a body of people who witness to this reality, and are the place where others can come to meet the Risen Lord, again and again.  Here he is, calling us out of our protective “armor of presumed innocence.”  \\nThat is the “what now” after Easter.  Jesus is calling us out of ourselves, of our past, into his future where the Risen Jesus is already ahead of us.  Calling us to keep reaching out into the world, out of our own experience of forgiveness and renewal.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.   \\n',\n",
       " '\\tBoth our scripture passages today have an otherworldly feel to them.  They describe mysterious scenes that are hard for us to imagine.  Hebrew prophets in the first; and some 700 years later, in the second story, we have Jesus, two deceased Jewish leaders and three frightened and confused disciples.  Chariots and horses of fire, dust-filled whirlwind in the first.  A luminous face lit from within, dazzling white raiment in the second.  Are they real scenes?  Vividly recorded personal visions?  We are not sure.  My eyes reflexively squint as my mind struggles to picture these scenes.  These are ancient narratives, preserved across the centuries for the purpose of giving us glimpses of the mystery of God.  And in both narratives, the presence of God, the Almighty, is linked to certain people who seem to have strange, out-of-the-ordinary, almost superhuman qualities.  God is portrayed as an awe-inspiring and over-whelming presence who is hidden by fire, then later obscured by a bright cloud.   How do we as 21st century people, who don’t regularly see scenes like this except in B movies, engage these texts?  How might these narratives guide us in this interim period at Falcon Heights Church, United Church of Christ, as we seek to better understand God’s vision and purposes for this congregation in transition? \\n\\n\\tAs I have wrestled with these texts this week, I’ve been also pondering and preparing for the upcoming Lenten season.  Lent has traditionally served as the time of reflection and spiritual preparation for the events of Holy Week and the transforming presence of the Risen Christ in our lives at Easter.  During History Sunday last week, many of you participated in small groups where you shared both times of joy and disappointment in your experience in this congregation.  After transcribing over 100 sticky notes, so our Discovery Team can summarize them, I was encouraged by the wild mix of delight and gratefulness experienced by many of you.  And, I was troubled by the depth of hurt, bitterness and lingering anger the notes revealed.  As the Worship Ministry Team and I met this last week, we explored ways that the Lenten season might help us move forward as a congregation.  How might Lent invite us into some personal reflection, some prayerful individual wondering about your own actions/inactions in this complicated church system?  And perhaps, in the Lenten call humility and repentance, how might we encourage a move towards forgiveness and hope among you? \\n\\n\\tIn my Lenten preparation, I have bee re-visiting a book called Listening to God: Spiritual Formation in Congregations by John Ackerman.  He describes what he sees as a distinct change in Christian spirituality in the last 50 years.   I think that exploring this shift in emphasis may give us a clue about these divine encounters described in today’s scripture readings.  It also may suggest a way forward where there are still broken hearts and wariness among us.\\n\\n\\tIn his introduction, Ackerman presents a challenging picture of the change in Christian spirituality in the last 50 years.  Ackerman writes:  “There has been a sea change in the past 50 years in the nature and character of Christian spirituality.  In the 1950’s, spirituality was centered in churches.  That was where one found God.  Churches were organized with top-down authority.  Scholars had more authority than laypeople, and the ordinary person in the pew found comfort in an institution.  The tectonic shift has moved us from spirituality found in a place of dwelling to spirituality experienced in a group of seekers.”   He goes on to describe how “habitation spirituality focuses on the God who has a sacred space in heaven and on earth in which humans can dwell.  Before the 1960’s this belief was the predominate expression of spirituality in America.  A ‘seeking spirituality,’ which arose in the 1960’s, is characterized by knowing God on the journey rather than in houses of worship alone.  In a “dwelling spirituality,” experts provide guidance for the laity, and a systematic way of thinking and behaving prevails.  A “seeking spirituality” is focused not on a place so much as on the activity of search for meaning, journeying through life.  The new pattern accepts a great deal of diversity and choice.  At its worst, it is a shopping-mall mentality; at best, searching acknowledges that one style of spirituality does not fit at all.” \\n\\n\\tIf I understand Ackerman correctly, one way of relating to God is knowing God in a place, such as a church community.  Another way to relate to God is connected with knowing God on a journey, on the move.  He notes, “both patterns are ancient.”  Both habitation/dwelling spirituality and journey/seeking spirituality can be found in our scriptures.  “Traditionally,” Ackerman continues, dwelling spirituality constructs the Temple in Jerusalem and finds God in the Holy of Holies; seeking spirituality is found in the (journey through the Exodus in the wilderness of the) desert, in the words of the prophets.”   A sense of belonging to tribe and congregation, our place of worship becomes a safe haven where we can find answers to life’s perplexing questions. God as “a mighty fortress,” “ the rock of ages,” the refuge to which we can flee in life’s challenges.  All of these are Biblical images which, rightfully so, both define and sustain us.  What Ackerman is suggesting is that this image of church is not going to sustain and challenge the enormous complexity, rapid changes and diversity of the 21st century world.\\n\\n\\tAnd what struck me when I studied our Old and New Testament texts for today, was that both narratives seem to challenge any kind of nostalgia for place.   Before we get to the final demise and departure of the prophet Elijah, both the book of Joshua and I Kings tell the story of an amazing travel itinerary for Elijah and his protégé Elisha.  They travel to the place where the Israelites first camped after crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land, but they keep going.  On to a sacred temple site of the Northern Kingdom, Bethel, but they keep moving.  Back to Jericho, where the Hebrew people first triumphed over the Canaanites, and on to the Jordan River where the people had crossed in a miraculous fashion.  These holy sites are all bypassed; there is no lingering in place.    As it becomes clearer that Elijah the mentor is going to die and leave Elisha, there is no certainty about where or when; only that it is going to happen in an extraordinary manner that will pierce Elisha to his bones.\\n\\n\\tIn the New Testament story, we find Jesus’ disciples in much the same situation as the young, student prophet Elisha.  The disciples are getting a hint of what is coming next, as Jesus has begun to talk with them about the fact that he is going to go to Jerusalem, even though it is dangerous for him.  He speaks of and suffering at the hands of the religious and political authorities and that he will die.   Like Elisha, the disciples don’t really know when or where; only that Jesus appears to be warning them of his own death and their own eventual suffering in following him.   And when they get to this mountaintop scene in all its glory, it will not be surprising that the disciples press for a new habitation, a place to memorialize.  They will yearn for a “dwelling spirituality,” as Ackerman would describe it.  Better to stay and commemorate a glorious past than to press ahead into the uncertain future.  This is also a challenge for us in churches, be it in celebrating anniversaries as a congregation or looking ahead to new ministries.\\n\\n\\tThe disciples immediately want to build a shelter to commemorate what they have seen:  Jesus glowing radiant and bright, Moses there representing God’s law to the Jews, and Elijah of the Jewish prophetic tradition.  Both key figures right there with him, symbolizing the whole known Jewish tradition in Jesus’ time.    “Rabbi,” cries Peter: “it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!”  A place where this amazing scene will never change!  But a cloud overcomes them and they hear a voice: “This is my beloved son” – same words as after Jesus is baptized, but with an addition – “This is my Beloved, listen to him!”  And “suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.”  And immediately they are on the move again, following Jesus back into the teeming crowds, the healings and preaching, the impending confrontations with the authorities.  So much for staying in place.\\n\\tJesus would not let them build booths to preserve this scene; he will not let them stay there on the mountaintop.  God’s instructions?  Listen to Jesus. Keep moving and listen.  This really is the invitation the church offers to the wider community.  Come, we don’t give you all the answers, but we will journey with you as together we listen to Jesus in a rapidly changing world.  Join us as we will search the scriptures, pay attention to the changing needs of the world, and prayerfully discern God’s guidance together. \\n\\tThe challenge for any congregation is that our dwelling, our place and our history, our rootedness in beloved traditions together, cannot be our primary focus. Today’s texts name our tendency to “build booths,” to only memorialize a beloved past.  Be we are called to ongoing spiritual transformation of our hearts and souls.  And this will change us and push us to more fully engage with our changing, hurting and needy world. \\n\\n\\tI invite you to join us during our Lenten journey this year, as we tune our ears into God’s presence in our midst.  Come party with us on Fat Tuesday; we will blow-it-out with fattening foods, music and fun. Then the mood will shift and we will end the evening in a brief ritual of affirming our human mortality with the ritual of receiving ashes on our foreheads or hands.  Or stop by the church briefly on Ash Wednesday for “Ashes to Go.”  Join us in worship on Sundays in Lent as we explore the ancient seat of spiritual wisdom and transformation: the heart.  How do our hearts harden?  How do they soften and open?  How might we look deep into our own hearts, and reflect on our own parts in the history of this church?  How do we let bitterness and grievances of the heart begin to soften….to dissolve.  What might the transformation of the heart look like?   Let us continue to listen together as we journey through Lent.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tEarlier this week, one of you described a recent experience with one of your grandchildren.  Now this grandmother and her grandson were spending the day together during one of the numerous school closures last week.  Somehow they had gotten on the topic of “currencies,” – this is with a 6 year old, mind you.   After some discussion about how different countries have different types of currencies (yen, dollars, euros, pesos and such), the child decided to create some credit cards and debits cards.  Our current currency of choice, at least the one obvious to our children.  After some mutual play with various pretend credit and debit cards, the child announced it was time to make a “worship card.”  “Hmmmm…that’s interesting,” said grandmother.  “Just what does a worship card do?”  “Well, you can use it to get things, like you can buy goats to send for Heifer project like we do at church” replied the child confidently, “you can get food for poor people with it.”   Apparently a loaded “worship card” can make good things happen and it is about getting things for other people.\\n\\n\\tAs we discussed the implications of this unusual interaction in our Wednesday morning Bible study, I was struck by this child’s insight into how a “worship card” might function.  Having received permission to share this story publically, I invite you to explore this idea with me for a moment.  The 6 year old may be on to something important about our life together as a church.  Any “plastic” has to have something loaded on it, be it a debit card, a credit card, gift card, for it to be worth anything.   I suggest that a “loaded” worship card can do more than we know.  It provides certain value:  spiritual and emotional currency, that, for starters, enables us to make life choices based on our values and beliefs.   But just what is it that gets loaded up on our internal “worship card” when we participate in Sunday mornings together?   Shifting the analogy a bit, is worship simply a spiritual 7-11 where we dip in for a quart of intellectual stimulation and a loaf of “feel good” inspiration?  Are we just privately “tanking up” here?   Not according to one of the 6 year olds in our congregation!\\n\\n\\tEach month in our newsletter, I describe our weekly worship as “the heart of our life together” here at Emmaus.  What do we get here, what value loads up for us on our “worship card,” that we don’t get elsewhere in our lives?   It makes good sense to say that, in worship, we learn more about God and we learn more about the needs of the world, so we can go out and serve better.  And it took a child to remind me of that this week.  But I also think that one of the most important things that gets loaded up on our “worship card” is a deeper understanding about ourselves.  And it is that transformed understanding of ourselves that eventually that starts to make a real difference in our lives.\\n\\tOur Biblical forebearers spent a lot of time asking God to clarify their current situation:  “are you still with us? they would demand of God during difficult times.  Who are we to you, chopped liver?”  In their worship and in their sacred writings, the community would recount where they had been and what it had meant:  wandering Aramaens were our father and mother and we were chosen as God’s own; we were slaves in Egypt and we were released and saved by God’s almighty hand; we were given a new land and taught to become a light of justice and compassion to all nations.  As followers of Jesus, we stand within this tradition of those who would look back and remind themselves of God’s claim on them.  Now the Bible is full of stories of people not living up to God’s intentions, yet they keep claiming who the are.  As part of this family line, we are invited to see ourselves in these words from the Jewish prophet Isaiah:  we have been taken by and kept by God, we too have been given a covenant to be that Light and to open the eyes of the blind, release the prisioners.  Why?  Because God is always doing a new thing, and we are to be part of it because of who we are as God’s children.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWhy does this matter?  Because the world so often tells us otherwise.  Our media tells us we are important if we look a certain way, are a certain age and own certain things.  Bosses tell us we matter based on our productivity.  Who are we; whose are we?  Are we owned by our work, our hobbies, our debts, our past failures or mistakes?  We come to worship and we hear a different message:  we are reminded that we are created, formed, redeemed, owned by God.  According to the prophet Isaiah, writing during the horrendous time of Israel’s capture and exile to Babylon, we are each called by name:  “you are mine,” says God.   Whose are you, Anne?  Who names and claims you?  Well, I come from the Swallow clan, hardy New England stock, married into the Gillis clan, lived in a lot of places, sure do like to think that I own myself, have autonomy over myself, if I’m really honest.  Empowered and independent, I am! Don’t nobody own me! \\n\\t\\n\\tBut scripture seems to indicate otherwise:  “Anne, you are not your own.  Your are mine, says God.”  You and I:  We are God’s off-spring, God’s children, sons, daughters of the living God.  When we baptize our little babies and our adults, we affirm that they are God’s children, and we promise to be as family to them in their faith formation.   When you and I worship together, Sunday after Sunday, we are loading up this identity awareness on our “worship card.”\\n\\nI have wondered what Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan meant to him as he moved through his brief three years of public ministry.  John the Baptist invited fellow Jews to step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly drew Jesus to do this, to emerge from an obscure youth and young adulthood, and align himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  Subsequent church doctrine insists that Jesus was without sin.  But did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually dry himself?   Desiring to turn his life around, as he seeking to quench some deeper thirst in those river waters, to ritually engage his past and his future as he entered into a dramatically public and dangerous path of teaching and healing?  Did memory of his baptism bring him comfort and courage as he faced rejection and eventual persecution, torture and death?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  This Jesus who with baptism, knew himself to be worthy, loved and intimately connected to God, as he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”  Perhaps the question for each of us is similar:  Do we know ourselves to belong to God, to be beloved sons and daughters?  Do we truly experience that God is pleased with us?\\n\\tEach week when we come to worship we come as a slightly different person.  We may bring a new awareness of our gratefulness, a deeper sense of our need to forgive someone, some increasing anxiety or fear, a growing sense that we need to be accountable for an area of neglect or wrongdoing in our lives.  It’s hard to admit this stuff; we don’t want to seem weak or dependent.  Put another way, you and I come here each week with a renewed sense of urgency:  ultimately, what guides my life?  The world? Or God?  The rigors of Christian life, with the constant call to self-honesty, generosity, openness and inclusivity, can be overwhelming.   We load up our “worship card” each time we are together, with the stories of Jesus and the taste of God’s grace that we receive in oneanothers presence.  We hear again that God is pleased with us, just the way we are….and that God is desiring more from us than to stay just the way we are.  We come to baptism seeking the watery mark of God’s grace and we come to the Table to receive the taste and texture of God’s extravagant welcome.  Through these sacraments, these holy acts, we boldly remember we are identified individually, named, by the Mysterious Creator of the Universe, and that this reality lays claim on us.  We are God’s precious son’s and daughter’s, created this way as humans and called to be loving and generous family together.  We load up our “worship card” as we remember whose we are.  And we once again head out into the world, to live and serve in Jesus’ name,  empowered by the value on that card.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'Money, possessions, acquiring stuff, treasure.  Almost half of Jesus parables deal with the connection between our money and our spiritual well-being:  The dangers of wealth, focus on possessions and the disparity between the rich and the poor was one of Jesus’ favorite topics.   I’m puzzled when many parts of the Christian church stay myopically focused on debating sexuality and gender roles, private sexual morality and sexual orientation.  Because Jesus talked much more about money.  He seemed to have an uncanny sense that the way we use money reveals a lot about who we really are, and where the deepest priorities of our hearts truly lie.  In today’s Gospel reading, Jesus pushes us to an awkward, vulnerable place as he teaches about our relationship with money.  \\n\\tAs we consider today’s text from Luke, it may help to note the context for the story.  A huge crowd had gathered that day; the Gospel writer Luke notes a few verses earlier that people were pushing and trampling on each other in their eagerness to hear Jesus.  Right before this interchange about finances, Jesus is speaking privately to his circle of close followers.  He warns that they should not be afraid of their bodies being killed.  And in the same breath, he reassures them that even the sparrows are not forgotten in God’s sight, and therefore the disciples are not to be afraid: God values them even more than the sparrows.   This is a telling preface to today’s story:  you may die, yet your security lies elsewhere.  Your security and safety lies in God’s valuing of you.  Let your heart sink into this, says Jesus.  Do not be afraid.\\nAnd, Jesus listeners, begin faithful Jews steeped in the Hebrew scriptures, would have also been familiar with today’s reading the prophet Hosea.  They would know this parenting metaphor - of how God is like father who tenderly lifts his child up to his cheek, like a mother who patiently teaches her toddler to walk.  God the loving parent whose “compassion grows warm and tender” even when the wayward child does not repent.  Whose anger does not turn into wrath, but urges God’s offspring homeward.  This is the God who waits to hear from us, yearning like a loving parent.   This is the wider context in which the disciples hear what Jesus says next.  And at this point they may well be asking themselves: God values me but might let me be killed? What’s God’s valuing of me worth?  \\nWhile the disciples are chewing on this paradox, all of a sudden someone in the large crowd calls out to Jesus:  “Teacher!  Tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me!”  Jewish law at the time prescribed that the oldest son would normally receive double the younger son’s share of any inheritance.  The disciples are probably rolling their eyes at this rude interruption.  Once again, Jesus gets triangled into someone else’s conflict!  But as Jesus refuses to mediate this family feud, he shifts his attention to what may underlie the man’s request:  Friend….take care!  “Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”   Jesus zeroes in on our accumulated stuff and what it means to us.  “Where your heart is, there your treasure is also” Jesus warns.\\n\\tA few summers ago, fires were raging throughout my former home-state of California.  And I got a phone call from Deborah, my close friend and United Church of Christ clergy colleague.  She was on the brink of losing all of her possessions.  Her family’s simple home was located in the rugged terrain of rural Big Sur, in the path of the massive fires sweeping down the Central Coast of California.  From the safety of a friend’s house in town, Deborah described to me her frenzied midnight evacuation from her beloved home built by her husband.  They had quickly gathered some art work, a few photos, their passports and tickets to the Carmel Bach Festival, as they fled their canyon neighborhood.  And at that point, they were still waiting for news about their house.  “What would I grab,” I wondered to myself.  “What is most important about my stuff?  What do I value the most?”   Facing today’s text from Luke, I remember Deborah’s phone call and have to ask myself:  What is my connection to my material possessions?  Where does MY heart really lie?  Does all my stuff keep me from seeing and responding to what is most important in the life in front of me?  \\n\\tJesus, after refusing to mediate a family dispute about inheritance of property and money, tells a short parable.  Known as the story of the “rich fool,” this teaching story describes a successful person who seems quite prudent and not foolish at all.  His land produces an over-abundance of crops and he carefully finds a way to store it and reap the benefits.   Certainly it is a wise move to construct larger storehouses; there might be famines in the near future!  Here we have the recognizable paradigm of a self-made man, enjoying the well-earned fruits of his labors!  These are treasured American ideas!  But there’s a catch:  before he can enjoy much of this, the man dies.  “This very night your life is being demanded of you,” says God in the tale.  What?  An accounting?  There is no talk of the man’s final destination or judgement, heaven or hell.  Yet, something about his encountering God in death is linked with all that the man has prepared, has gained, has focused on as his treasure.  But where did the guy go wrong?  It’s possible his accumulated wealth entailed the exploitation of workers, the reduction of resources for others in the community.   But notice what is missing in his story:  The man expresses no gratitude to God for his abundance and he shares nothing with anyone else. \\n\\tWe read more closely and notice this guy says “I” and “my” a lot!  I’m going to do this, consult only myself, then I will do this with all my stuff.  Not much “we” here, is there?  Then I’m going to sit back and congratulate myself.  Self!  Soul!  You’ve done great; relax and enjoy yourself!   Paragon of virtuous independence!   I’m afraid we tend to love this kind of story.  The rugged individual; self-made person deserving of what he or she manages to accumulate.  And is defined by it.  Hard worker!  So why does God call him a fool?  Is it because this man imagines he lives in isolation?  Who else had a part in all of his success?  Where did he get his land from?  What color was his skin?  Did he start out in priviledge?  He makes no acknowledgement of participating in an abundance that comes from God through the gift of the earth, the land that his servants till.   He is self-absorbed; he takes no delight in nor gives thanks for God’s graciousness.  He displays no notice of, nor care, for neighbors in need.  No connection, no sense that he is part of the family of God.  \\t\\n\\tThis may be at the core of why wealth is problematic.  It’s not wrong; it’s just risky.  It can be isolating.  It can make us forget about connectedness and inter-dependence.   We assume that we can secure our future and our safety.  We assume that our belongings, our treasure, can in some way save us.   And we put our heart there.\\nAs I spoke with my friend Deborah that day, I could hear the concern and sadness in her voice.  But she did not sound afraid.  I sensed a steadiness in her, as she spoke of the many, many people, the connections that she had established over the years as a religious leader, as an environmental activist and community volunteer.  These connections were now enfolding her.  She spoke of the web of prayer, from people around the world, that surrounded her.  Yes, her simple cabin home amidst the redwoods and eucalyptus trees was a treasure to her, but it was clearly not where her heart was.  In the middle of the fearsome, overwhelming power of a seemingly unstoppable forest fire, I heard her faithfulness, her sense of safely in God’s presence.   I give thanks for Deborah’s witness to where our true treasure might be.   I give thanks for Jesus who understood this so perceptively and guides us this day in re-locating our own hearts.  Like a loving parent, God so desires richness for us:  A richness that give thanks.  A richness that seeks the well-being of others, as well as our own.  How might we each grow “rich towards God?”  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAs many have noted, both publically and privately,  this has been an extraordinarily difficult and unsettling week: for the people of Boston, for our elected leaders, for the people of West, Texas, for those among us whose jobs have been focusing on finding resolution among all these tragedies, and for all of us watching nervously and in frustration on the sidelines.  And as if a bombing, defeated gun control legistlation and a plant explosion wasn’t enough, our community of Emmaus is confronted this morning with the sudden and sad news of the death of our beloved fellow member and leader, Alan Jensen.\\n\\tWorship is a good place to be, following a week such as this.  Not because things all get answered and fixed here.   You and I gather in worship to seek comfort and strengthen in one another’s presence, as the gathered community of faith.  And we gather to hear the Good News, give thanks to God in all things, as we open ourselves to God’s wider perspective and purpose for our lives.   So, what is our Good news this morning?  For what do we give thanks?  How might we perceive our Creator’s broad vision and understand what all this means for us?\\t\\n\\tWe remember that we are in the liturgical season of Eastertide, a period of Easter when we consider the stories of Jesus resurrection and his unexpected appearances to his shattered community.   Stories of the encounter: with the grieving Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb, with the two bewildered disciples traveling the road to Emmaus, with the skeptical Thomas in the upper room, with the stunned fishermen by the seashore.  We hear extraordinary accounts of the early church:  from tales of sudden conversions, like the apostle Paul’s we explored last week, to astounding healings, of a fragmented community drawn back together in courage, in a new awareness of Jesus continued presence.  If we already have had a difficult time imagining or believing in Jesus’ bodily resurrection, these Biblical stories during the Sundays after Easter will strain our intellect even further.   Eastertide will lead us through Jesus’ dramatic final departure into the clouds, then, ten days later, the wild wind of God’s fiery spirit descending on his follower’s in Jerusalem at Pentecost.   What are we to make of all this strange and incomprehensible activity?   What does it show us about what God is willing and working in our lives today?\\nIn trying to sort through this period following Jesus’ death and the various resurrection appearances, I have been helped by the writings of Cynthia Bourgeault.  may give us some direction here.   An Episcopal priest, medieval scholar and teacher of Christian meditation practices, Bourgeault is representative of a growing number of contemplative Christians who understand Jesus in the wider scope of worldwide wisdom traditions.  Her book, The Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind – a New Perspective on Christ and His Message describes that  Jesus was primarily a teacher of the transformation of consciousness and that Jesus came to teach us how to awaken the core of our being, our hearts, so we could be empowered to move out into the work in compassion and service. As Bourgeault relates current brain science findings to the workings of contemplative prayer practices, I have been intrigued by her description of what she calls “the deadening aspect of Christianity,” where we “live with 20-20 hindsight, knowing the story of how it all turns out, and we are lulled into a sense of security that we are on the winning team” (public lecture, House of Hope Church, St. Paul, MN, April 23-24).   She says that we “lose the tool of our inner recognition of Jesus“ and with this, we lose a sense of the immediacy and ultimate reality of God’s presence in our lives.  \\nIn her book, Wisdom Jesus, she describes this time after Easter. “Jesus is back, and he is indisputably in the flesh,” she writes, “but it’s not exactly the same flesh he left the world in.  Nor does he show any indication of planning to remain here for any length of time.  He doesn’t reappear in Jerusalem, unpack his bags, so to speak, and start rounding up backers to found the Jesus Christ Institute of Spiritual Transformation” (p. 127).  She speaks of Jesus’ body as being of a more “subtle density” now, appearing out of nowhere, moving through walls, mysteriously vanishing.  But there is important work to be done in this period, suggests Bourgeault.  It is as if, during this period before his ascension, “Jesus is relentlessly pushing and prodding his troops towards a new level of subtlety, like a mother bird pushing her fledglings out of the nest” (p. 131).   And each time they recognize him, something inside of them will light up.  “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us?” the two disciples on the road to Emmaus will marvel.  They will each “come to understand that their attuned hearts are the instruments of recognition and that these same attuned hearts will bind them to their risen Lord moment by moment and forever.  They have finally located their inner homing beacon,” concludes Bourgeault.  \\nFrom the perspective of the resurrection appearances, this passage the Gospel of John, where Jesus is talking about being the “good shepherd” and how his “sheep” hear his voice and follow him, starts to make more sense.   In encounter after encounter during his earthly ministry, Jesus invited people not so much to believe a certain doctrine but to simply “follow me.”  When asked where he dwelled, he would reply “come and see.”   But it was never a specific habitation; people were invited was simply into his presence, into a relationship with him, to hear his voice.  And the resurrection appearances taught his followers that this ongoing relationship of compassion and clarity was still unfolding.  This is what the Gospel of John is trying to communicate to us:  his communities experience that Jesus was there some 40-50 years later, in their daily encounters with his spirit, if they listened with the ears of their hearts.  This “good shepherd” would continually challenge them to let go, and stop clinging to the places where the world insisted they would be secure, where they would be acclaimed, where they would be powerful.  \\nAs we wonder about this encountering the Risen Jesus, how tender to be offered the text of the 23rd Psalm on this Sunday, to be reminded of this ancient song proclaiming the God of all creation as the “good shepherd.”  I once read of a Presbyterian pastor who said that most other Psalms use “homeland security language” when they write of God’s protective presence:  God is a fortress or stronghold; a high place or refuge; all military terms that might fit better with saying “the Lord is my King” or “the Lord is my commander” (Kenneth Bailey, Presbyterian Outlook 2008, “Psalm 23 and Jesus).   But no, this is the Psalm that leads us into some counter-intuitive statements: “ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”  This, in a predominant culture that is constantly convincing us of things we might want and desire.  “I walk through the darkest valley, down the gully, the crevice, and I fear no evil.”  This, in a world where we are constantly worried about security, where we are seek to root out the suspicious looking ones in our midst, from potential terrorists to undocumented workers.   \\nIn a subtle shift, the Psalmist brings us from the shepherd’s field to the dining room, and lifts another counter-intuitive image:  This God who works so intimately in our lives as an attentive shepherd is also gracious host.  This God spreads out a table before us “in the presence of our enemies.”  Food, oil, overflowing cups, abundance.    Shepherd, host, enabling goodness and mercy not just to follow us, but to actually pursue us.    \\nContemplative Christians such as Cynthia Bourgeault and others, remind us that we have to practice receiving from God the shepherd and host.  We have to practice because this does not come natural to us.   As humans, we are naturally bent on security and survival, and if we are fortunate enough to have the basics covered, we move on to establishing and preserving our own individual status and self-esteem.  And we brace ourselves and we hold on tight.  Our ears close to the deep, quiet voice of the the Shepherd. \\nThe deep irony is that it is only in the daily softening of our hold on this self-preservation program that we become available to God’s presence.  The invitation to daily prayer practices of surrender and letting go, releasing the places where we cling, slowly guides us into God’s care.  \\nWhere will we each encounter the Good Shepherd this week?  Watch for green pastures and cool waters that come your way; notice what happens as you walk through those dark places.  Where will we be invited to sit at the table of this Gracious Host?  Watch for those places of abundance, even with the enemies of scarcity and despair in the wings.  Let the food and the oil and the overflowing cup quietly astound you.  Encounter the power of this Risen Jesus as Shepherd and Host.  And give thanks to God.  Amen.   \\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tWe move deeper into the season of Advent in the church.  The late afternoon twilight, the quiet chill of the snow-covered woods and fields, frame our reflective spiritual practices as we prepare our hearts for Christ’s arrival.  We take time to consider the wider world, beyond the relative calm of our own circles.  We realize how profoundly we need the redemptive presence of God’s mercy, justice and peace.  How much we long for God to be truly coming to us, when our world is filled with such violence, inequality and despair!  This morning, our scripture passages and Schubert’s “Mass” invite us to draw further into this sense of expectancy and hope of God’s “perpetual coming to us” (Evelyn Underhill’s phrase, from Advent with Evelyn Underhill, edited by Christopher L. Webber).\\n\\n\\tThe prophet Isaiah speaks words of comfort to a people whose Jerusalem home and temple has been destroyed and who now live in Babylonian exile.  “Comfort, comfort my people, says your God…in the wilderness prepare a way for the Lord…the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”  Over 500 years later, John the Baptist appears in the desert wilderness outside of the restored Jerusalem.  Now faced with another occupying force of the Roman Empire, the people again suffer under oppressive and often arbitrary rule.  John challenges the people of Jerusalem to repent of their self-focus and their avoidance of the needs of the poor and marginalized.  “Repent,” he calls, “and make way for the One who will come and change this hurting world!”  John calls people to be baptized in water as a sign of their openness to God’s transforming action in their lives.  Then and now, repentance is our acknowledgement that we are cherished for who we are, but that we are also accountable for what we do. \\n\\n \\tWhile the liturgy within our reformed Protestant tradition no longer follows each portion of the Eastern Orthodox or Roman Catholic Mass, the confessional tone and words of praise in Schubert’s piece echo much of our spiritual yearnings and worship practice today.  It is fitting that we celebrate this work today, with John the Baptist’s call to “repent” and to “prepare” echoing in our minds. \\n\\n\\tSchubert’s piece begins with the Kyrie.  The word “Kyrie” is used over 740 times in the Greek New Testament, mostly referring to Jesus.  It means “Lord, Master.”  This is the only piece of Greek in this Mass set in Latin, a vestige from the early years when all the church’s liturgies were in Greek.  “Lord, have mercy on me.”  The prayer reminds us that our pride and arrogance needs continual acknowledgement and repentance, as these are often the foundation of our judging of others. \\n\\n\\tThe Gloria is a celebratory passage praising God the Parent (here described as “Father”) and Christ.  It begins with the words found in Gospel writer Luke’s record of the angels’ song to the shepherds, as they heralded the baby Jesus’ birth (Luke 2:14). \\n\\tThe Credo is a setting of the Nicene Creed, a statement agreed upon by church leaders in the 4th century as they struggled to define the nature of Jesus.  There was a serious heresy in the second and third century that questioned Jesus’ human nature. Some church leaders refused to believe that God would dwell in a “defiled” human body.   Wiser minds prevailed, insisting that God became incarnate in humanity:  Jesus is fully divine and fully human, the Nicene Creed affirmed.\\n\\tThe\\xa0\\xa0is a doxology or song of praise.  It is the final words of preface to the\\xa0 in both the Catholic Mass and in our own Communion Service. These joyful words praising the Trinity are often sung to a lilting Argentinian tune, here in our Communion service here at Falcon Heights Church.  “Holy, holy, holy, my heart, my heart adores you!  My heart is glad to say the words, you are holy God,” we sing as a congregation.  The Sanctus in Schubert’s Mass, describes us joining with the\\xa0, who are pictured as praising God with their song.  \\n\\n\\tWe come full circle back to our New Testament text for today with the Benedictus.  The words are from the song of thanksgiving uttered by\\xa0\\xa0on the occasion of the birth of his son,\\xa0.  Zechariah anticipated that the deliverance from the yoke of Roman oppression was now at hand.  He understood this to be a fulfillment of God’s original promise to his ancestor, the Hebrew patriarch .  Zechariah rejoices because the deliverance will not just be from a worldly power, but will also enable people to worship God without fear and serve God with spirit of justice. \\n\\n\\tAgnus Dei - We close with the “Agnus Dei.”  This part of the Mass is based upon John the Baptist’s reference (recorded in\\xa0)\\xa0to Jesus, when Jesus approaches him for baptism: \"behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.”  The Agnus Dei is the invocation to the Lamb of God sung during the breaking of the bread during the Eucharist, or Holy Communion.  “Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.”  \\n\\n\\tWe prepare our hearts and minds to receive this music.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tSheep, shepherds.   God and Jesus.  Hmmmm….let’s see if we can make some sense out of this.  \\n\\tFirst of all, how’s it feel to be compared to a sheep?  Most of us think of sheep are unruly and dumb.  But that might not be the whole story..  In Jesus time, and thousands of years before that, sheep were important for wool, meat and milk.   Sheep like to hang out together, which made it easier for people to herd them.  Their eyes are on top of their heads and they walk with a funny zigzag which lets them see behind them all the time.  Watching out for a wolf!  They have four stomachs which means they can digest all kinds of stuff we could never eat, like grass and weeds.  A night they would be all penned up with other flocks, but they were smart enough to know their masters voice, and would come to the particular shepherd in the morning to head out to pasture together.\\tNot a bad thing to be a sheep.  \\n\\tSo, I guess it can be okay to be compared to a sheep.  But am I supposed to be your shepherd?  When the PSC finds a new minister, will that person become your new shepherd?   I used to think so, but then I heard this story about a certain sheepdog named Esau.\\n\\tNow Esau’s human was Rev. Craig Barnes, a minister like me.  Esau was \\nactually a bearded collie, a type of Scottish sheepdog.  His human, Rev. Craig, used to think that he too was called to be a shepherd of his congregational flock.   But at some point he noticing something interesting about sheepdog Esau:\\n\\t1. On their morning walks, Esau would sniff all around and happily wag his tail.  Everyday.  Cloudy or sunny day.  Same thing.  Happy to be alive!  “Hmmmm,” though Rev. Craig, “I wonder if I’m supposed to be the one who is to keep paying attention to the goodness all around us and remind people about it.”   God’s grace is always in the air!\\n\\t2.  Then, when Rev. Craig and his family would go to the beach, Esau would try to herd the birds.  Not by running straight at them, in a head on confrontation, but coming in slant.  “Ahhhhhh” thought Rev. Craig, I might try that more often with my congregation.  \\n\\t3.  Rev. Craig noticed that Esau would not go to bed until everyone in the house came upstairs to their bedrooms.   The sheepdog stays awake until everyone is gathered in.  \\n\\t4.  Dog park lessons: Rev. Craig also realized that the dog park was not really fun for Esau, because Esau kept trying to round up the other dogs.  “Yes,” though Rev. Craig, ministry is not always fun and games.   Pastors, ministers, need to worry about the order and well-being of the whole community.  My delight is not to be in chasing Frisbees but “in helping others gather around the Good shepherd.”  \\n\\t5.  Rev. Craig started to wonder:  Maybe I’m supposed to be more like a sheepdog, than the shepherd.  He even went to watch some other border collies at some sheep herding trials.  Sheepdogs practice herding the sheep, as guided by the shepherd.\\n\\ta.  He noticed how the dogs didn’t bark much or make a \\t\\t\\t\\tlot of fuss; \\t\\t\\t\\n\\tb.  they would actually spend quite a bit of time sitting still and \\t\\t\\t\\tlooking at the shepherd.  \\n\\tc.  “These dogs are faithful agents of another mind,” Rev. Craig \\t\\t\\t\\tthought to himself.  “Always obedient to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmaster’s, the shepherd’s directive will.”  He realized \\t\\t\\tthat the shepherd was the center of the sheep \\t\\t\\t\\tdogs life, not the sheep.  And the only way the \\t\\t\\t\\tsheepdog keeps up this good, herding work is \\t\\t\\t\\tbecause it frequently sits down, is very still \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand intently watches the master, the shepherd. \\n\\t\\td.   And it rests when the day is done.  “That’s it,” Rev. \\t\\t\\t\\tCraig admitted to himself.  My job as a pastor is to \\t\\t\\t\\tnudge the sheep towards the only savior of the \\t\\t\\t\\tflock.  Jesus, the Good Shepherd who lays down \\t\\t\\t\\tHIS life for his sheep.\\n\\t\\n\\tAs a minister, your pastor, I continue to learn how to \\n1. sit still and watch and listen to the master shepherd, pay attention to Jesus’ teachings, listen to his Spirit speak in my heart. \\n2. without barking or fussing or ostentatious displays of authority, try to lovingly nip at all of your heels.  \\n3. I too am just one of God’s creatures, an animal in this analogy, just like each of you.  I don’t save anyone; that’s up to God.  We are all learning to understand what the Good Shepherd wants us to do with our precious lives.\\nAmen.\\n\\t\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tI find it rather curious to hear these two scriptures passages this morning.  They seem to inhabit two different spheres: the Psalm – private prayer between the author and God.  A song of praise, thanking God for God’s loving presence that is steady presence through thick and thin.   From conception through the present, God being our refuge, our fortress, a safe place.  And then Luke’s description of Jesus’ very public start to his ministry.  It’s an abrupt conclusion to the story we read last week:  Jesus is first received with welcome approval by his hometown as he speaks in his synagogue.  But in today’s finale he proceeds to royally tick-off his neighbors.  To the point where they want to throw him off a cliff.   Jesus seems to pick a fight and it is hard to feel God’s steady, loving presence in what he has to say.  Comfort in the Psalm, and an unexpected challenge, even judgment, in Luke’s passage; a strange contrast.  Two different ways of understanding God’s action in our lives.  \\n\\n\\tMoving first into the scene in the synagogue, let’s see if we can figure out what the great teacher of “loving our neighbors as ourselves” is doing… besides raising people’s hackles.   Beginning his ministry, Jesus has traveled around speaking in different synagogues throughout Galilee.  Here, he returns to his hometown Nazareth and attends worship in the synagogue with what are probably family and neighbors.  He takes a turn reading from the Hebrew scriptures; his portion is from the prophet Isaiah.  It tells about the Messiah, the expected savior of Israel who will bring good news of rescue to the poor, and release to the captives, and healing to the blind, and the start of the Year of Jubilee - all signs of God’s in-breaking reign of mercy and justice.  Jesus sits down, everyone is staring at him, and he says to those assembled, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  Hmmmm… …murmur several people, interesting….isn’t this Joseph’s son?”  Can’t you see them nudge each other: “I remember when he was just a boy, helping in his father’s carpenter shop!”  No one seems too disturbed at this point.  But then Jesus launches into a rambling diatribe, declaring that the congregation is getting ready to oppose him.  Putting words in their mouths, he suggests they will demand some kind of favoritism, special miracles like he did in other towns, because he their hometown man.  \\n\\n\\tJesus finishes off this rude assault with provocative references to great Jewish prophets of the 9th century BCE:  Elijah and his disciple Elisha.  Each of these men was known for showing God’s mercy and compassion to outsiders.  Apparently, this is what finally infuriates the Nazareth crowd, because these are references to their history when they, the chosen people, did not seem to be favored.  In the first case, the prophet Elijah ignored needy Israelite widows during a famine and brought aid to a Phoenician widow, restoring and empowering her to new life.  In the second, the prophet Elisha chose among many needy lepers to heal a Syrian military commander of his leprosy, restoring and empowering him to new life.   The widow and the commander were both Gentiles, outsiders.  Jesus is in the synagogue congregation’s face: The healing power of God’s kingdom is to extend to those we consider to be outsiders. \\n\\n\\tAnd the people get it and they are “filled with rage.”    Perhaps they realize that when the marginalized are truly empowered, it tends to change the status quo.  Our resistance to this, as the insiders, seems naturally ingrained, because it may mean loss of advantage and privilege. Loss of a way of life that we might feel is already threatened.  I think this is the root of the tension between urban and rural parts of our country, and also at the center of our immigration debate.  The fear of losing “things as they have always been” may be even be part of our contentiousness as a small town and also as a congregation. I wonder, how do we deal with these stresses and fears in ourselves?\\n\\n\\tRowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Anglican Church has been known for inviting outsiders into conversation.  He would invite those out on the edges of British society and outside the Anglican Church, into open dialogue about spirituality and faith.  Out of these experiences, he wrote Tokens of Trust: An Introduction to Christian Belief.  He focuses on the idea that belief is more an act of trust than intellectual assent.  Belief is less about a right or wrong set of ideas; it’s about an action, a trusting. For Rowan Williams, belief in God is trust in a loving relationship.  This is the core the Psalm today: having a trust that in some essential way, we are held safe.  I do not believe the Psalmist spoke of a fantasy safety where we will never be ill or injured or die.  It is more the interior safety that comes from a growing awareness of an anchorage, a refuge that holds our very being.  Outward circumstances may shake it this trust, but cannot destroy it.  To illustrate, Williams compares Christian affirmation or belief in a loving God with the “formula used by Buddhists when they make their statement of common purpose to their community: (A Buddhist will say) ‘I take refuge in the Buddha’, meaning, “the Buddha is where I belong, the Buddha is what I have confidence in to keep me safe.”  Again, not immune to human frailty and suffering.  But, again, this interior safety.  What Williams is getting at is that our beliefs aren’t primarily intellectual ideas; they are really descriptions of a place, an inner anchorage in love, where we “find solid ground, home.”   “In you, O Lord, I take refuge,” wrote the Psalmist years ago.  What a marvelous breath-prayer to take into our week:  “In you” (inhale and pause).  “I take refuge “ (exhale and pause).   This sense is not automatic, but builds with daily contemplative practice, prayer, meditation, soaking in scripture.  \\n\\nJesus intuits his eternal refuge in God’s love; it’s what enables him to do his ministry of teaching and healing in spite of the opposition.  His refuge in God was not a place of safety.   But it is what empowered him to push the assumed boundaries of God’s mercy, even when gravely threatened.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps the Nazareth congregation wondered: (New Testament scholar Matt Skinner):   “what if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?”  Is this historic practice of the Jubilee year with forgiven offenses and debts too much?”    One NT scholar writes of our reluctance to be too generous: (Skinner takes a provocative leap himself in an article entitled “Immigration Reform and the Challenges of Generosity). We “resist outsiders and their empowerment,” he writes.  In the immigration debate, “To empower certain people toward citizenship scares many in America,” he continues.  “Do we fear loosing our advantage, our privilege?”  he asks.  In our fear, do we loose track of supporting family unity and hard work and people in need?  “What if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?” asks Skinner (Odyssey Networks, 1/29/13 posting).\\n\\n\\tOur toughest challenge as church is to be the kind of place where theological, economic, sexual orientation and political diversity does not unravel our loving interactions here.  Perhaps our greatest witness is to provide this experience of loving refuge, as it flowers in our patience and kindness with one another.  We will be better able to reach out to the outsiders and those disempowered beyond our doors.  All this is made possible as we take refuge ourselves in the living, loving God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAt the point he writes this letter, Paul is one of the early leaders of the small group of Jesus’ followers.  He has traveled all over the western Mediterranean talking about the teachings and presence of Jesus, and forming small communities of the early church.  He gathered such a group in the city of Corinth, in which people of all different social classes, slaves and free people, rich and poor, would come together to talk, pray, sing, read scriptures and share a meal of bread and wine at the Lord’s Table together.  They would make sure everyone had enough, and that there was food and money left over for the poor.  But they were all so different.  They struggled with getting to know each other, hanging out together, listening to God’s direction together.  Paul writes in his a letter to them that he knows this is hard, because they are all so different.  “You each bring different spiritual gifts to your congregation, for the purpose of the common good,” he wrote earlier in this letter.  “Keep working at this,” Paul pleads with them, because, “you are in fact the Body of Christ on earth now.”  Paul takes this commonly used body reference out of the political realm and applies it to their spiritual community.   “Jesus the Christ is no longer walking around on earth, but his spirit is with You…. His Spirit dwells in each of you and all of you together.”  To try and explain this amazing idea, Paul says:  “You are the Body of Christ, and individually members of one another.  You are the hands and feet, eyes and ears, belly button and toes of Jesus Christ here on earth!  You are all connected.  You matter to each other.  No hierarchy.”  Unlike the political state, implies Paul, you are all of equal importance to the whole.\\n\\tAt our Board of Directors meeting earlier this month, I asked them to do an exercise with me.  Think of this church, I said, imagine this church, as the living Body of Christ.  Imagine it as a body, a person.  What?  Yes, try it.  If this church were a body, a person, right now, what would it be like?  Well, they thought and imagined….and started to share.  Try it yourself.  What would you say?  What do you see when you think about this?  A man or a woman?  Gender-fluid, called out one Board member.  About how old would you say this body, this person, is?  Baby boomer, someone else commented.  What kind of shape is it in?  Been injured, is recovering.  Has a chronic condition!  Needs on-going attention and symptom management!  What is important to this person, I asked?  What challenges does it face?  What does it value?  Which brings us to the task at hand today.  What does the Body of Christ here on the corner of 2nd and 3rd, actually value?   When we are at our best, what core values guide our choices, our behavior, our witness in this community? \\n\\tI love how the ancient writer Paul talks about how the parts of the body all belong together.  All of us play different parts in the body and are all connected to each other.  The hand can’t say to the foot: I don’t like you very much, you don’t belong here.  Paul says that when one part of the body suffers, all suffer.  I think of that when we share joys and concerns.  We are happy and we are sad, all of us, depending on what is happening to each individual member.  Pushing the image a bit further….what part of the body are you?  What abilities and gifts are yours to share for the increased well-being of this body?  How is God speaking through your imagination about our church today?\\n\\tAs you now move from this Sanctuary Into small groups, you will be invited to think about what this body might look like in the future.  You will be asked to consider the year 2025, to think “outside the box” and wonder together about what kind of vibrant ministries might be happening here at that point.  You will be asked to imagine that 5 years from now, something about the creative and dynamic ministries of this congregation has caught the media’s attention.  A newspaper reporter has written an article about our church’s vibrant, engaging, ministries out in the community.  What would we be doing out there beyond our doors?  Picture being a truly vibrant and transformative church.  What would relationships be like among all of you?  “Members one of another,” wrote Paul.  What would your connections with and impact on the wider community be like?  What values would be most evident?  I invite you to imagine what that would look like.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tPalm fronds; potent symbols of all far-away places sunny and warm.  We finger these slender, fibrous pieces of greenery, and might imagine a large, ancient city under bright springtime sunshine. It’s the annual spring festival of the Jewish Passover and people are pouring in from the surrounding towns and countryside.  They stream towards the Holy City to celebrate the “passing over” of the angels of death in long-ago Egypt.  They will remember their ancestors’ escape from slavery under the oppressive Pharaoh, the long journey through the wilderness to land in which future generations now dwell.  Celebrating Passover in Jerusalem would have been a life-long dream and people pour into the city from the countryside.  Adults, children are tired but eager as they round the Mount of Olives and catch their first sight of the glowing city.  They are awestruck by the four miles of encircling stonewall, and there in the middle of the city are the shining gold-embellished walls of the giant Temple. \\n\\nThe industrious Roman-puppet King Herod has been hard at work transforming this place for over 30 years by the time these celebrants arrive.  A Jewish leader despised by his own people, Herod fawns for his Roman superiors.  Prestige and power are everything: he builds palaces, citadels, amphitheater, viaducts, public monuments.  Herod hugely expands their center of worship, the Temple.  All to gain prominence and esteem in the eyes of occupying Roman Empire.   But grand and beautiful as it is, this is a city on edge.  Jerusalem residents and visitors alike are straining under the increasing tax burden and the offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Rome and its minions.  After several centuries of prosperity and autonomy following the Babylonian exile, times have changed.  Since Alexander the Great’s conquest in the 4th century BC, their spiritual home has been occupied by idolaters.  No one knew when a statue of a Greek or Roman god might be installed in the Temple, or when there would be new restrictions on the people’s ability to adhere to the Torah, their law and their joy. This is what it is like to live in an alienated homeland (see Paula Fredriksen, From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus, 1988).  With Roman occupation, the Jewish people become convinced that the government and major institutions sought to insidiously thwart their religious practices and destroy their way of life.   They long for a restoration of autonomy, religious freedom, and justice.  A natural, and understandable, hope for people all over the world, even today.\\n\\nThis is the Jerusalem Jesus and his disciples are approaching on what we now call Palm Sunday.  A Jerusalem where Jewish leaders are worried about stability and safety for their people and where Roman authorities are beefing up security.   Biblical scholars Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan have studied this period in Jerusalem’s history, and wrote a book entitled The Last Week:  What the Gospels Really Teach about Jesus’ Final Days in Jerusalem (2007).  They suggest that there very well might have been two processions entering Jerusalem on that fateful day.  This one we just heard about from the Gospel of Mark, coming from the east, mostly peasant farmer types who have followed Jesus into town.  Jesus sitting astride a donkey colt and riding through one of the city gates, with the people crying out “Hosanna,” Aramaic for “save us, we pray.”  “Save us from what?” we might wonder.  From sin?  From the Romans?  \\n\\nOne thing is clear:  everyday people are having a rough go and want things to change.  They are searching for meaning to their present suffering and are desperately hoping for a changed future.  The crowds wave palms, throw down cloaks and branches at Jesus feet, identifying him a Messianic figure that will bring a new era of peace, justice….and vanquished Romans.   They want their Jerusalem and their Temple back and the Romans gone.\\n\\n\\tBorg and Crossan have suggested the possibility of another, simultaneous procession entering from the west, at the opposite end of the city:  the Roman governor of the region, Pontius Pilate and his entourage.  We might picture him summoned from his seaside villa, in administrative capital at Caesarea Maritima, by his Roman superiors.  I can’t imagine Pilate being very excited to make this inland journey (really, Pilate, you ought to get down there for the Festival of Passover! Bring a visible display of law and order to that city; place is crawling with riff-raff, brazen preachers and healers and possibly armed rebels lurking about; make a big statement Pilate - imperial cavalry and tough-looking soldiers and all that!).  What a contrast:  Through one gate, imperial power and might, swords and snapping flags, prancing steeds and armored soldiers.  Shock and Awe.  Impressive.  Through another gate, excited but weary commoners on foot, a preacher/healer man on a donkey.  Not so impressive.  \\n\\nWe begin to get a sense of how Jesus’ audiences resonated with his preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  They would have understood him primarily through the lens and the longings of this very prevalent theology of restoration (see Paula Fredriksen).  It had evolved into a hope for universal renewal; a restored Israel and a wider world of morally transformed, non-idol worshipping Gentiles.  Prophetic visioning began to happen all over the place, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare, believing they were living in the last days, and preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists abounded.  They were all performing signs and wonders that were a signal both of their intimacy with God and as pointing to the End Times.  Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  And his vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation.\\n\\nSuddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he raises the dead, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   But Jesus doesn’t ride a horse.  He rides a donkey.  In ancient Israel the kings would ride a horse off to war, and a donkey to signify they came in peace.  Is this street theater?  A parody?  This is the man who is to go head to head with the Roman powers?  Where is his power?\\n\\nYears ago, everyone seemed to be reading the book written by a Jewish rabbi When Bad Things Happen to Good People (Harold S. Kushner, 1981).  The author’s son had suffered terribly and died from a childhood disease.  When faced with such suffering, Rabbi Kushner found himself questioning God’s reality.  He wrote that our claims about God could end up contradicting each other if we aren’t careful. He challenged the notion that God is both all-loving and all-powerful.  In Rabbi Kushner’s mind, God cannot be both.  How could someone all-powerful and all-loving, allow people to suffer?  Kushner leaned towards affirming God’s love and facing the fact that God appears to limit God’s power among us.   I find this a compelling view.  It has helped me better understand what Jesus was doing that day he entered Jerusalem.\\n\\nWhat is God’s power really about?  Jesus rides in on a lowly donkey.  Pontius Pilate rides in on a huge mighty steed.  I would say that these are both power statements.  And there is something oddly subversive about this Jesus entry, if you ask me.  Or perhaps I should say, Jesus is purposely revealing the subversive nature of his own Kingship.  The real power, God’s power, is not about force, bigness, shock and awe.  God’s power intentionally self-limits.  God’s domain is about self-giving.  Empowering peace.  Compassion and Mercy.    \\n\\nA few decades later, the early Christian teacher and apostle Paul will write a letter to his church at Philippi.  Reading through this short letter, one quickly gets a sense that this church had some serious internal power issues.  They were constantly haggling over who gets to decide what, whose opinion matters the most, who wields the most influence in the congregation’s decisions.  Church conflict is apparently as old as the church!  In his letter to this first century congregation, Paul encourages his people to “let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.”  We may hear this as:  “now I want you all to agree on church doctrine and there will be no variation or theological diversity!”  But I don’t think this is what Paul is describing.  As we read on in the letter, Paul speaks of how Jesus “emptied himself.”  Paul says that Jesus,  “taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.”  Does this reveal something to us about God’s power?  Perhaps God’s most powerful aspect is God’s self-giving to us, out of God’s Self?  A God who empties-out God-self for all that is not-God.  Not-God.  That would be all of creation, humanity, us. “Have this kind of mind,” writes Paul, of self-emptying and humility among you.\\nOur lives do sometimes feel like an “alienated land” and we long for a sense of power, control, visible restoration.  We get confused, dismayed by the paradoxical kind of power which Jesus taught and enacted in his life.  The thought of humbling ourselves, pouring ourselves out, seems counter-intuitive.  Yet God calls us to hope for and work for a changed future in this kind of servant mode.  I wonder how might we talk about these challenges in an even deeper way together at Falcon Heights Church?  What might this kind of self-emptying power look like among us, as we be church together?  \\nThe ambiguity and turbulence of Holy Week brings complicated themes of life and death.  It confronts us again with the question of God’s powerful and restorative presence in the midst of human suffering. Always the realist, Jesus knew it is not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  There he is, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us; let us follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tAll of this was appalling to people like Martin Luther.  He also insisted that the Bible should be available to people in their own language, like German or French or English, not just Latin.  Luther wanted to put the Bible into people’s own hands, in their own languages, so they could read the stories of the ancient Israelites, Jesus’ teachings and the spiritual instruction in the letters of the early church.  He wanted people to be able to read the Bible for themselves so they could be shaped by God’s living Word. He kept preaching that God loves us, forgives us and welcomes us into eternity not because we pay money or do good deeds.  It is God’s grace alone, and our trust in this grace, that keeps us connected to God.  Luther’s 95 points about where the church was messing up, eventually led to a painful split in the Christian church.  It led to years of bloody fighting Protestants and Catholics throughout Europe, and to the eventual formation of over 20,000 Protestant denominations, including places just like Falcon Heights Church, United Church of Christ. \\nA common saying throughout the Reformed communities of Europe was that they were “the church reformed, but always needing to be reformed.”  I find this idea of church reformation important to consider during a time of change in any congregation, especially during an interim period between called, settled, pastors.  Any church is “always needing to be reformed.”  New mission statements need to be crafted so congregations can respond to the current needs of the world around them; structures, traditions, the-way-we-have-always-done-things may need to be reformed and changed, to better serve the movement of the Spirit among you.  That’s my stock message to churches where I serve as the interim pastor.   But I think we have to be very careful here, because we can be quick to identify those other things, those other proceedures, those other people, who need to be reformed.   Especially when there have been major disagreements in a church, we can be quick to identify the change needed in other people.   And we forget, or maybe we avoid, the challenging reality that we each need to be re-formed. \\n\\n\\tSunday after Sunday, I read the scripture texts and I realize again:  God’s Word offers both good news and what may feel like bad news.  Take today’s line-up from the ancient Jewish scriptures, the Book of Leviticus, paired with this saying of Jesus from the Gospel of Matthew.  Both these passages are about commandments.  This is not generally considered a “good news” word for most people.  Commandment?  Is someone trying to tell me what I can and cannot do?  How un-American!  No church should be able to boss me around!  I am a rugged individualist, a self-made person, the boss of myself, thank you very much.   Apparently Jesus, and the whole Jewish tradition before him, had a different view about this.  In our covenant relationship with our Creator God, there are some expectations about our behavior and our very being.  There are some assumptions about how God wants us to act and when we fall short, there are some assumptions about our re-formation.  Church isn’t just a place where we get warmly comforted and inspired and enjoy a tight-knit, like-minded people community.  Here is what may seem to be bad news, or perhaps simply, the challenging news:  Church is to be a place where we are equipped and empowered to change who we are and how we act….to be re-formed.   Or, put more bluntly, “God loves you just the way you are, but God\\xa0refuses\\xa0to leave you that way.” (Max Lucado)  The Christian life of discipleship is all about being re-formed.\\n\\t“So Jesus,” said the Pharisees, the scholars of the law, the lawyers of their day, “Great Teacher, which commandment in our Law is the greatest?”  This in itself was a weird question because Jewish law was considered to be a sacred whole.  All of it was believed to contain ways of applying the principle of love in relationships with God and with humans.  But the religious leaders want Jesus to spell out where one’s allegiance should go, and then they can argue with him and nail him. They want to trip him up.  I think this is similar to questions that fly in congregations that have been in conflict:  Which transgression was the greatest?  Who messed up the most in our recent history?  These are trip-you-up-question.  Why?  Because these questions allow the questioner to avoid the deeper question of “what has been my part in this conflict?  What action or attitude needs to change in me?  Where do I, myself, need to be re-formed?”  The Pharisees seem unwilling to see what part they might play in the reform of their own tradition and that is where they get stuck.   In congregations, when we still want to blame others, we also are stuck.\\n\\t“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”  Jesus answers by going to the core of their tradition:  love God with all you’ve got, heart, soul, mind.  Love your neighbor as yourself.   Nothing new.  It was spelled out for the early Israelites during the Exodus period of wandering through the wilderness, as we heard in the Leviticus text.  Don’t render unjust judgment.  Don’t slander; do not hate in your heart or bear a grudge against your people.  Love your neighbor as yourself.  Love God, love your neighbor.  \\n\\tWe want to denigrate love, by making it seem romantic or impractical in our governance models.  “How does talking about love ensure that nothing like this (whatever our particular ‘this’ is) never happens in our church again!”   “What’s the greatest commandment that has been broken, what ‘s been the greatest transgression, who was most wrong?” we demand.    “The greatest? The most important thing here?” asks Jesus.  “Love,” he answers as he swings the conversation back to each of us personally.  Love God and one another as you love yourself.  Because this is going to re-form you.\\n\\tIf I love God with all my heart and soul and mind, I have to at least be paying attention to something else beside myself.  What does it actually mean to “love God?”  I tell you honestly, I am still trying to figure this out.  But I am learning it has something to do with where I put my attention.  Can I be still for a period of time each day and simply pay attention to God?  Or simply pay attention to the silence around me, even if things are roaring between my ears?   We know this in our family life, in our friendships; love has a lot to do with simply paying attention.  Acknowledging the other person, listening to the other person.  This kind of attention is love in action; it allows others to feel seen, heard and to feel real in our presence.  And as we do this giving of attention, this kind of loving, it changes us.  It reforms us.  I come to recognize that my view, my perspective, is not the only one.  Others have different experiences, different feelings and different perspectives.  This slows me down a tad; it humbles me a bit.  Love others as you love yourself.  Ouch.  Loving means being aware of our own selves.  Navel gazing?  I don’t think so.   What have I experienced, what am I feeling, what has been my part in what has happened?  Self-awareness.  Self-love.  \\n\\tYears ago, there was an older man in one my churches.  He was often gruff and sometimes contentious in meetings.  He and I were working together on a committee that was trying to visualize the church of their future.  We were talking about the purpose of the church; what business are we in here?  This man suddenly blurted out:  “We have to be a school for love!  Church is the place where we learn to love.”\\n\\tLoving God, loving others, loving self:  Jesus knew these all are linked together and that this loving can change us.   He knew we were not made to travel our spiritual journeys alone as individuals, where our preferences are maintained and our perspective remains unchallenged.  Jesus called people into this “school for love” so that we may be re-formed in that loving.  Thanks be to God for “the church reformed and always re-forming.”  Amen.      \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThis is a bewildering story, set in the strange and meandering Fourth Gospel .  The writer known as John composes this Gospel about Jesus not until the close of the first century CE.  He (or she) never met Jesus, but freely rearranges and rewrites stories and sayings of Jesus for a widespread community of early churches spread throughout Asia Minor.  These are communities of Jews who follow the Risen Jesus, had spread way out beyond Jerusalem throughout the Med, since the Holy city’s destruction in 70 CE.  These Jewish Christian communities were now in considerable tension with local synagogues which rejected claims that Jesus was indeed the Messiah and Son of God.  This Gospel is actually more of a theological statement, than a historical biography of Jesus, The author takes great liberties to allow the Risen Jesus Christ to speak directly into the challenges facing these emerging Christian communities.  \\n\\tJohn places this story of Jesus’ final miracle, which John calls “signs,” in the middle of the Gospel, almost like a hinge point of “before” and “after.”  We enter this story set within a few miles of the huge metropolis of Jerusalem, an immediately a confusing scene unfolds before us:  an urgent request for help, indications of deep friendship, two days of hesitation, dallying on Jesus part, angry accusations from his close women friends Mary and Martha, theological proclamations about his being the Messiah and Son of God, intense anguish and grief, and finally a dramatic act of healing.  Now Lazarus is dead; now Lazarus is resusitated.  Before we even get to this bizarre and frankly unbelieveable detail that someone is actually raised from the dead, we are confronted with a rather callous seeming Jesus.  Why in the world would he hesitate for two days before going to Bethany to help his beloved friend Lazarus, brother of his women disciples Mary and Martha?  Yes, earlier verses tell us he is busy across the River Jordan, teaching and healing there.  You can walk these distance to Bethany in under an hour.  Why the delay?  \\n\\tJesus is recorded as saying: “This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”  Wow.  Tell that to his frantic, grieving sisters.  Is this a twisted version of the simplistic and hurtful platitude: God is going to use your suffering for a greater good” - ?   I, for one, am not willing to embrace a notion of such a cruelly manipulative God.  The story may also lead us to may wonder why our loved one was not healed or pulled back from death or resurrected.  Does the love of the risen Jesus Christ extend to everyone, or only to special first century folks like Lazarus?    \\n\\tThere are many reasons to dismiss this story, especially when it is lifted up as a tale with a happy ending.  See!  This Jesus is really amazing!  He must be divine – he brings the dead back to life!  And Jesus does that for us too!  Just believe!   It’s easy to toss the story off as another fanciful tale, in part because we are fact-focused post-Enlightenment people, who live in a world of measureable evidence and verifiable fact.  This sounds suspiciously like an “alternative fact” that the church has pushed for years.  A dead person is made alive again.  Right.  \\n\\tI can sense that temptation to cynicism and avoidance within myself, and am reminded of how these attitudes can sometimes stifle energy and my openness to new information.  A cynical hopelessness can creep up on me, especially when I’m feeling despairing, as I’m sure Mary and Martha were.  These days I notice a creeping cynicism and avoidance in myself and others as we are overwhelmed with the huge governance changes that are happening in our nation, as we observe from afar the never-ending violence, suffering and starving around the world.  The enormity of the healing work in front of us often leaves us feeling scattered and de-energized.  I do notice that cynicism and avoidance can bring numbing quiet to the tumult in my head and heart.  But a larger part of me does not want to stay there.\\n\\tI was struck by the quote at the back page of our worship bulletin, the end of the last paragraph:  “Optimism is a political act.  Those who benefit from the status quo are perfectly happy for us to think nothing is going to get any better.  In fact, these days, cynicism is obedience.”  The writer closes by noting that “to believe in the future; to believe in resurrection might be the most radical belief of all!”  Let’s dive back into this story and see if we can find some clues, some connections to our lives.\\n`\\tThe Gospel writer tells us that the disciples are not pleased that Jesus wants to head to Bethany, near Jeusalem, when he finally decides to head over there. They are aware that the religious leaders are increasingly nervous about the crowds Jesus draws, and look to harm him.  In living under Roman rule, the chief priests in the temples and the wealthy lay leaders who own large tracts of profitable land walk a thin line.  They themselves have become part of a local domination system that has drawn certain benefits under the imperial domination system.  (The Final Week).  Peasants who previously made a living off their land, growing their own fruits, grains and vegetables, now are forced to grow luxury crops of figs, dates and olives for export.  The products are heavily taxed, and don’t feed their families; the profits benefit the wealthy.  Others are forced off their ancestral lands.  All of this sounds hauntingly contemporary to me.    Jesus is one of many voices calling for reform and economic justice.  His criticism of those religious and lay leaders who benefit from this imperial domination system is biting.   He is already spreading a message that some forms of communal interaction and governance must die, so something else can be resurrected and live.  And ironically, heading towards Jerusalem is leading him to his own death.  When Jesus arrives at Lazarus, Martha and Mary’s house, its not surprising he used this language: I am the resurrection and the life.  But what does this mean?\\n\\tI was surprised to learn this week that archeologists and historians have discovered that the town of Bethany, just a few miles outside of Jerusalem, was some kind of site for the care of the sick.  There seems to have been some kind of poor house for the destitute, a leper colony and a hospice for the dying.  (wiki)  Did this event of bizarre life-giving healing really happen here, or does the Gospel writer place the story here so his or her readers might know something about Jesus?  From 2000 years away, we cannot be sure.  But I do know that it has been among such suffering communities that I have at times found the most hopefulness, and ironically, the most new life.   I know this is not unfamiliar to many of you.  We encounter people dying, who seem radiant with love, with forgiveness, hopefulness, with life at its fullest.   We hear miraculous stories of communities who forgive in the midst of atrocity:  a Amish community devasted by a killer’s school-house rampage;  a southern church Bible study decimated by a racists violent hatred.   Oddly enough, the openness and forgiveness of these communities served to resuscitate them and bring them new life.\\n\\t. These are resurrection stories, and when I start to really pay attention, I realize they are all around me.  And I think these stories are unsettling because they challenge me to look at places where I would rather cling to death.  Where it would seem I prefer my life energy be drained away by resentments and regrets, by cynicism and hopelessness.   But these are the ways of death, and Jesus knew it well.  They are caves in which it is easy to hide when the news overwhelms us, or the church history just seems to complicated, or the relationships are too tangled.  And we feel like we are entombed, or walking in the dark and there is no light in us.  \\n\\tWas Lazarus really dead or just taking a nap?  Was he totally dead and brought back to life just by hearing Jesus’ voice?  I am not totally sure myself about what I might have witnessed if I had been on the scene.  But I find deep truth in this story.  Something in me resonates when I hear Jesus bellow loudly: “Lazarus, come out!”   Because there are places that I am enclosed in the dark, and sometimes it seems safe and even comfortable.  But the Spirit of the Risen Jesus is persistent:  “Anne, come out!  Resurrection is not something that happens in the future; it is a present reality…..let me draw you into it!  And this is what is might look like and this is how I want you to help me make it happen!”  \\tWhere does new life need to happen for you?  Where is the energy and hope blocked within each of us?  I think that throughout our lives we are invited to be resurrection stories.  Again and again the Spirit of the Risen Jesus is going to call us out of our places of darkness and death.  Will we be listening?  Will we respond to that call to “come out?”   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tHave you ever been looking at something and all of a sudden it changes right in front of your eyes?  You are watching storm clouds quickly approach, but then all of a sudden it clears and the sun comes out.  Or a rainbow slowly forms in the sky, shines with all its colors, then fades away.  Or you watch your friend who has a sad look on his face and then suddenly it lights up into a smile.  The change happens right before your eyes.  \\n\\tI think this is what happened to Jesus friends when they were on top of the mountain in our story today.  Jesus changes before their eyes!  Jesus had been doing a lot of teaching and healing with many people crowding around.   Probably needed some peace and quiet, may have gone up on a mountain to pray.  “Peter, James, John, why don’t you come with me?”  The Bible story says all of a sudden Jesus was TRANSFIGURED – his face started shining like a sunbeam and his dusty dark robe went all white and shiny.  What?  Pretty strange.  Next you know, these two other men are standing next to him:  People from LONG ago – Moses who led the Jewish people out of slavery in Egypt to the promised land in Israel (over 1000 years before).  Moses who went up on top of a mountain to talk with God and received the 10 commandments to bring them to the people.  And next to Moses was Elijah, who also had gone up on top of a mountain about 600 years before this to receive special instructions from God, to go tell the Jewish King – hey, you need to stop being so corrupt, you need to take care of your poor people and orphans and widows better!  Moses and Elijah!  The disciples are shocked – these guys, Moses and Elijah died a long time ago!  And they are talking together!\\n\\tI wonder what they were talking about?  The storyteller doesn’t tell us.  I wonder.  All three were spiritual teachers….I wonder if they were talking about a problem all teachers have….how to get people to listen….to really listen to what you are saying…?  \\n\\tMoses – my people kept getting scared, the trip through the desert was so long.  That made it hard to listen to what God wanted to teach them about being a community together.  I went up the mountain and they got impatient and worried and built a statue out of gold and worshipped it!  They didn’t listen to me!\\n\\tElijah – I know what you mean!  Those Kings, they had a lot of power, they thought they were so important – they kind of lost track of what God wanted them to do.  \\n\\tJesus – No kidding! I keep telling my disciples that I need to keep spreading my message of love, my message that even the people we don’t like are important, we should love our enemies. This is hard to listen to; they don’t like the part about how I may have to suffer for this message, and they will to.  It’s hard to listen to that.  \\n\\tWow…it’s really hard for people to listen, isn’t it?\\n\\n\\tThe disciples, Peter, James and John have been watching all this.  Peter gets all excited!  Let me build some tents here, some booths that can go over all of you, and make it permanent like!  You guys are famous!  People can come up here, and watch you and hear you.  A permanent shrine.  We can all stay up here together!  It will be great!\\n\\tWhile Peter is still yammering on about this mountaintop becoming some sort of spiritual theme parl, suddenly clouds gather and cover everything and a voice says:  THIS IS MY BELOVED SON; I AM PLEASED WITH HIM; LISTEN TO HIM!  Boom! Peter, James and John are so freaked out they fall to the ground, very afraid.  But Jesus goes over and touches them and says GET UP AND DO NOT BE AFRAID.  And they look up and only see Jesus; in his dusty dark robe with his face looking normal.  COME ON, TIME TO GET DOWN THE MOUNTAIN….I HAVE MORE HEALING AND TEACHING TO DO AS WE HEAD TOWARDS JERUSALEM.\\n\\tI wonder what they talked about as they went down the mountain….Jesus, what WAS that VOICE?   Maybe Jesus said to them, remember how I told you about when I was baptized in the River Jordan, when I first started my teaching and healing time?  God said, THIS IS MY BELOVED SON – I AM PLEASED WITH HIM.   Well, there it is again.  Yeah, and this time it told us to listen to you, Peter might have said. Hmmmmm…Jesus might have said.  How about that.\\n\\tHis disciples had been hearing him for several years now, as they traveled together teaching about God’s love and healing people.   Hearing and listening: \\n\\t1. OUR PARENTS TEACH US: When my kids were little sometimes I would have to remind them to look at me; I had to teach them how to listen.  Look at my eyes, hear my words.\\n\\t2.  BUT WE GET DISTRACTED: I’m fixing dinner in the kitchen, distracted with chopping vegetables, thinking about my day…someone in my family starts to tell me about their day.  I hear the words….but am I really listening? \\n\\t3. WE WANT TO BE RIGHT: I’m in a meeting, with a heated discussion.  You may be talking but my brain is thinking what I will say next.  I’m listening to my brains ideas, not your words.  That’s how arguments go, don’t they?  Sometimes I have to slow down my brain – listen to understand first.  What is this person saying, what might they be feeling?\\n\\tDuring the season of Lent we will be learning to listen more deeply.  We will listen to Jesus’ teachings and the stories about his interactions with all kinds of people.  And we can all practice listening more deeply to each other.    \\nAmen.\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\t“Let the waters under the sky be gathered together in one place, and let the dry land appear,” says God in this creation story from our Hebrew Bible.  The narrator continues: “God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together God called Seas.”  Seas.  Oceans.  “And God saw that it was good.”  (Genesis 1:9-10).   In the poetry and metaphor of the Creation story, God says that the Sea is good.  But the early Hebrew writers also spoke of water as a foe, or a force, which the Creator must overcome.  The symbolic language of Genesis describes the original waters of chaos not being destroyed in the act of creation but as being pushed back.   Throughout the Hebrew Bible, the God of Israel’s history becomes the ruler of all water, which can be both destructive and life-giving. \\n\\n\\tThis morning, our land-locked Minnesotan children are off exploring God’s good gift of ocean creatures and the care of today’s oceans in their “Caring for Creation” summer program.  Meanwhile, I invite all of us fresh-water lake-focused adults to also ponder the presence and mystery the deep, salty seas of our planet.  So far away, yet so much a part of who we are. It’s floating plants produce 75% of the air we breath, create the weather we experience, food we eat, the salty blood that runs through our veins, and the tears the flow from our eyes.  And now, in this 21s century, our oceans are so imperiled, so damaged already, so needing of our collective good stewardship as planet citizens.  Our worldwide ocean is vulnerable in ways our ancestors could never have imagined.\\n\\n\\tOceans….wide, deep, mysterious.  For eons it was perceived as an endless watery highway for travel; for years public policy and laws about oceans came out of our national Department of Transportation.  It has been seen as an endless source of fish protein and a great place to dump all kinds of trash.  Many of you have memories of ocean encounters:  watching crashing waves along the shore or maybe sailing on a ship to a far away place, perhaps even snorkeling or scuba diving.  Perhaps your remember sinking your toes into wet sand along the waters edge, or being pushed around by the surf, tasting the saltiness on your tongue or its burning up your nose.  I imagine there are some of you who have never been near or in the ocean, and you rely on images in your mind’s eye.  The sea was a great source of fascination for me as a young girl, as it cradled and sometimes endangered my father’s Navy vessels as he sailed to foreign lands.  Through the years, my siblings and I would eagerly watch from either an Atlantic or Pacific coast beach for his various ships returning to port.  The ocean often tossed and churned me, ground me into the sand and left me frightened and sputtering when I miscalculated the power of its waves.   Salty ocean waters were an early lesson about powers greater than myself.  They were also the place of independent, private peacefulness and even sensuality, as a preteen spending hours floating up and down over the rolling breakers in the warm southern California sun.  When I think of oceans, first I have to give God thanks and praise.  How might you acknowledge and give thanks for your own ocean experiences?  \\n\\n\\tI would suggest that whether we are deeply familiar with the ocean or not, for most of us it has been a surface encounter.  Today, I am inviting us to go deeper, to consider our inter-connection with and our responsibility for the well-being of all the oceans.  In doing so, I will also share some of the ocean work of my long-time friend and UCC clergy colleague, The Rev. Deborah Streeter, who coined this marvelous term “Blue Theology.”\\n\\n\\tWithin the wider United Church of Christ, there has been a long-time dialogue between science and religion, both at the national level and within our local congregations.  Deborah was part of early formal conversations between UCC scientists and theologians, sponsored by our denomination in the 1980’s and 90’s and she continues as part of the UCC Science and Technology Network.  A former parish minister and hospital chaplain, she finally drew her environmental interests and love of the ocean into a new ministry called Upwellings: A Ministry of Environmental Stewardship.  For years she served on the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary advisory board, as the first representative from faith communities, which helps assure public participation in the maintaining of this huge federally protected marine area.  With Upwellings, she formed an alliance of people from churches and synagogues, environmental groups, and education organizations focused on the loving care of God’s creation, especially the coasts and oceans.  Her church on the Monterey Peninsula sponsors the the Blue Theology Mission Station: a program which invites church youth and adult groups to experience how current science in marine biology informs a theology of creation care. (bluetheology.com).\\n\\n\\tAn “upwelling” is a fascinating ocean phenomenon I learned about in my years on Monterey Bay, on the central coast of California.  As Deborah has described to me, during most spring and summer seasons the coastal wind currents would shift and start to blow the waters of Monterey Bay southward.  This makes room for the very cold, nutrient-rich waters of the deep Monterey Bay canyon region to drift to the surface.  To upwell.  These are deep ocean currents, explains Deborah, that have been in the depths for thousands of years and are full of small plant and animal life that feed the marine life closer to the surface.  This phenomenon takes place on five of the earth’s ocean coasts.  Since humans have no control over this ocean occurrence, Deborah insists that it had much to teach us about the mysterious, uncontrollable movement of God’s spirit among us.  “Our spiritual connection to the natural world is like that upwelling gift;” Deborah describes. When the surface is blown away, new life and new possibilities emerge from the deep, nutrient-rich waters (“Ten Commandments for the Ocean,” a sermon by The Rev. Deborah Streeter, preached at the Disciples of Christ Church/Christian Church, Pacific Grove, CA, 10/2/11).  \\n\\n\\tDeborah also suggests that the upwelling phenomenon is a great metaphor for the movement of the Spirit.   I resonate with this notion.  I find that the wind of the Spirit often blows through my own life, or the life of our congregation or our nation, in so many ways that are unexpected, disturbing, unsettling and even frightening.  Often, I find that these wind-events in my life are blowing away surface assumptions, memories or habits that may no longer serve me.  These wind-events often expose people and situations for who they really are.  With the “surface” cleared, new ideas and understandings are able to flow up from the depths of our consciousness.  From the recent shootings in a church in Charleston has come the realization that the Confederate flag must come down from the state Capital.   What is blowing across the surface of your life these days?  Across the surface of our life together as a church?  Where is God drawing up new nutrient rich ideas, energy and hopefulness that will feed your life, our life together?  \\n\\n\\tMay we continue to pay attention to these “upwellings” in and around us.  Thank you, Deborah, for your vision and your ministry of ocean stewardship.  Thank you oceans, for our life origins and breath and mystery.  Thank you, God, for the gift of the seas.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words…\\n\\nWe know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to (God’s) purpose. (Romans 8)\\n\\n\\tWe have just heard some words from a letter, written by one of the early ministers and teachers in the church.  After Jesus died, Paul traveled around near where Jesus lived, spreading the good news that the spirit of Jesus was still alive, bringing new life inside people.  He started a lot of churches, then would write letters to them, encouraging them.  His church in Rome was having a hard time, and he wrote these words:  even when you don’t know what to pray for, the God’s spirit prays inside of you.  And We know that all things work together for good for those who love God.  \\n\\tNow that first part makes sense for me.  I like this idea that the Spirit is inside, deeply sighing for me, when I need help.  But that second part is alittle more confusing.  All things work together for good.  You mean if something bad happens in my life, it’s a good thing?  My dog dies, or my dad gets sick or I lose my job or a friend is mean to me, that is working together for good?  Probably most of us have had this verse, or something like it, offered in a crisis.  Something terrible has happened in our lives, in our family or in our church, and someone is trying to console us.  All things work together for good, they remind us.  Their intentions are well-meaning; they are trying to help in a situation where a bad thing has happened to a good or innocent person.  It’s meant to be….God doesn’t give you more than you can handle…\\n\\tBut it gets me thinking about what kind of God this might be.  A God who sits at a giant control panel in the sky, like a big computer, and plans awful things to happen in our lives.  “Here, let me send as earthquake, or make someone sick, or I’ll start a war over here.”  I don’t think that is true.  But we live in an imperfect world, where mistakes, disasters happen and people hurt each other.  Some are big and some are small.  \\n\\tMany years ago, when I was a young mom, I was standing by our kitchen sink preparing dinner.\\n\\t“Itchy is dead!”  The cry of anguish escalated as my young son hurtled down the hall.  I quickly turned from the sink as Nicholas burst into the kitchen.  Tears streaming down his cheeks, he could hardly speak.\\n\\t“Nicholas, what’s wrong?” I implored with mounting panic.\\n\\t“Mom!  Itchy is dead!”  Unable to identify the deceased, I hesitated.  Nicholas moaned, “my fish, Mom!”\\n\\tThe memory of that hot afternoon at the school carnival finally surfaced.  I quickly recalled Nicholas’ triumphant face as he presented me with the water-filled plastic bag containing a tiny goldfish.  “Look what I won!  I’ve named him Itchy!”  Remembering the survival rate of goldfish from my own childhood, I had hesitantly relented.  Now, the inevitable had happened and my seven-year old was inconsolable.\\n\\t“Oh, sweetheart,” I sighed, circling my arms around him.  He continued to sob hysterically.  As a hospital chaplain who specialized in helping people deal with loss, I was on familiar ground.  But as my own child continued to wail, I sensed a growing impatience within me.  I wanted to laugh out loud, “it’s just a fish!”  \\nSomehow I stopped myself.  I flashed on the way loss is often minimized: “It’s just a dog; you can get another one.”  “A miscarriage?  You can try again.”  “Don’t worry, you’ll find another job soon.”  These words of solace often discredit the sadness, anger and confusion people experience when something or someone precious disappears.  Yet, here I felt impotent in the presence of Nicholas’ despair and ached to make the loss seem smaller.  Like any good parent, I wanted to fix this.\\n\\t“We can get you another one” leapt to my lips.  But somehow I held the words back, knowing that few people are consoled by the idea of getting a replacement when a pet or human loved one dies.  Most of us need the healing work of active grieving before we can reinvest in life and love.\\n\\tNicholas’ sobbing was more muffled now.  I knelt down besides him, but I was in no mood to pray.  I was feeling a bit perturbed with God and wondered why children have to face disappointment and hurt.  Some people feel terribly angry and abandoned by God in times of loss.  “Why did God let her die?”  “Why does God let him suffer so?”  These are raw, tough questions that push against my understanding of fairness, the purposes of life, and of Mystery itself.  \\n\\tIn that moment on our kitchen floor, I wondered if God sometimes feels like this, like a mother circling a hurting child.  Does God yearn to replace the fish and make it all better?  There are times I plead with God to change the created rhythm of life and death.  “Where are you, God?  What are you doing?” I have demanded.  Yet, as I embraced my son, I remembered the ways God has held me during periods of chaos and grief.  Unexpected stirrings of gratefulness had emerged for me; there were moments of peace in the midst of mourning.  Family and friends were there to listen and acknowledge my loss.  Surrounded by such spiritual and emotional support, I found I could begin to do the work of grieving.\\n\\tSnuffling quietly now, Nicholas asked if we could bury Itchy.  We carefully scooped the floating carcass out of the fishbowl.  I sensed that my son was already starting his grief work.  Sermonizing or attempts to distract him from his pain were not required.  He had needed my quiet presence and compassion, and now went to blow his nose.  I returned to the dishes in the sink, marveling at God’s unfathomable tenderness and loving restraint as paren\\n\\tNow worst things have happened than a fish dying in our family.  But I realized it might give me a good chance to practice working these Biblical principles.  The Spirit of God is praying for you….and God is working all things for good, even this!  Sort of – start with the small stuff if you are trying to see how God is working all things together for good. I thought about how the Spirit was already praying inside of me, even when I was feeling frustrated and powerless; I liked that idea and began to get curious about what the Spirit of God felt I needed in this situation.  I got kind of curious; who might I meet when I go to get it fixed, what kind of conversations or encounters might come out of this pesky situation?\\n\\tI suggest we all try working with Paul’s teachings this week.  Try memorizing these two verses and work it with them in next interruption or irritation that comes your way.  Don’t try the big stuff right away; let the Spirit intercede within you with sighs too deep for words.  Watch for how God is working all things together for good.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThere once was a church in an urban area; at one time it had been a large, full church, a respected civic institution in a time when Christianity was the presumed religious voice of this city and this country.  But it had been in decline for decades as the neighborhood around it changed dramatically, families moved to the suburbs and the congregation avoided the changing mission field right outside their door.  The building was huge, in disrepair and it was just too expensive to keep it heated and repaired.  After much prayerful discernment, the congregation that remained finally voted to tear it down and create  high-rise apartments for newly arrived immigrants, with a sanctuary and church offices on the first floor.  Inside their front lobby was a tapestry depicting a phoenix rising from the flames.  ‘The Phoenix Rising from Ashes” was their renewed vision for their congregation.\\n\\tThere once was a church located in a northern mining center with many young transient workers.  The church became aware that these young people were hungry spiritually, but wary of institutional religion.  The older people in the church weren’t sure how to do this, but they felt called to befriend these young people in some way. The congregation felt called to reach out to these new comers, to provide them with spiritual mentors and to be a guiding light for foundational beliefs and values among these fortune seekers.  There is no display sign on the church property except for two huge colored spotlights that shine up into the night sky.  “God’s Northern Light” is their vision of who God  calls them to be as a congregation.  This church has become well known in this boomtown for being a source of wise council to those struggling with the ambiguities of daily living.\\n\\tThese are all congregaitons that took a hard look at the new world around them, at how the mission field of their community had changed.  They became clear about their values, beliefs and strengths, and what God wanted them to do next.  This is the task before us here at Falcon Heights Church in this time and in this place.  Another way to think about this is to ask ourselves:  “Who is our neighbor NOW?  Who are the ones we are to reach out to, as Jesus would have us reach out to the people who may not really seem like our neighbors?  What are the needs in the world around us that connect with who you are as a congregation?  Your values, your beliefs, your treasured traditions and strengths?  It’s in this connection, between these needs and who you are, that God calls you.  This is what we are exploring this month, and in the months ahead as the pastoral search committee is being formed.  What is the church that God calls you to be in the future?  And what kind of leadership will you need to help you be that church?  This is why the visioning process is so very important, yet is so different from such a process in a business or in a non-profit.  As the church of Jesus Christ, we claim that visions for ministry come not from our good brains figuring it out.  Visions, from Biblical times to the present, are a gift from God.  They are revealed and received.  It requires that we be listening, be paying attention to God’s direction as it comes within and among us.  Clarity about your vision is going to empower your yet unformed pastoral search committee to find a new clergy leader who is well suited to help lead you in these new ministries.  \\n\\tThis is not a very logical or rational process; at times it feels like fuzzy thinking, nonlinear, even non-sensical.  The Discovery Team, who has been working with me for the last 10 months to guide this interim exploration process, invites you to do some internal listening, imagining and see if you just might receive a vision from God about where this church should go next.\\n\\tYour fore-fathers and fore-mothers in this church believed that God was giving each of them, and future members, light and wisdom to interpret God’s truth. It’s there in your Constituion!  I believe this is the time to lean into this assumption, into this promise, and try it out.  Notice, as we move through today’s service, what images, inklings, imagingings come to you about where this church should be heading.  What makes your heart sing, and helps you feel hopeful?  Draw or write or record in some way this snippet of vision on the sticky-not included in your bulletin.  Post it on the glass wall right outside the sanctuary. \\n\\tAs I thought about this story from Mark, I noticed that Jesus’ followers had some difficulty with this receptive, visioning mode themselves.  Even with Jesus right there in front of them.  In this crowded scene where Jesus is teaching, people are bringing children to Jesus so he can greet and bless them.  His disciples have apparently taken on a body-guard mentality.  I’m reminded of the protective secret service agents trying to keep the people with kids from the Pope recently: the disciples tell the parents to back off.  Which actually made sense in that culture.  Young children were really nobodies in this time, considered of low status, not unlike women.  They were perceived as having little value in that culture.  But Jesus sees what his disciples are doing and becomes indignant: “let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.”  Oh how sweet, we might think, with our sentimental vision of cute obedient little children, how open and accepting they are.  “Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.”  \\n\\tFor years I thought this meant that we should receive God’s reign, God’s presence of mercy, healing and justice, with simple childlike faith and acceptance.  But one Biblical commentator I read this week noted that most kids are more likely to question, to say why? or if they are in their terrible twos (or as a teenager) their common response to any suggestion is probably NO!  (Mark Hoffman, Luther Seminary, Gettysburg, PA, working preacher site).  This commentator suggests that what Jesus really meant was that we are to welcome God’s reign, God’s Kingdom among us, like we would open up our arms to a little child.  Reception of God’s dominion, God’s transformative presence, is like warmly, carefully, embracing a child.  Or, put another way, “God is not experienced in display of power and might, but in weakness.”\\t\\n\\tBut this idea is so countercultural:  that in vulnerability, weakness….all things opposite of being big and powerful, that we most readily experience God’s action in our lives.   I wonder if Jesus’ teaching here may give us some new perspectives on how we grow in our faith, in our connection with God, throughout our lives?  It would seem that our faith formation needs to have more to do with helping us learn how to be open and vulnerable to God and with one another, to be understanding of each other’s weaknesses, humanness.  What would that look like?  What kind of gatherings, conversations and practices might that entail here in this congregation?  What are you en-visioning?  \\n\\tAs I encounter Jesus in this story, I remember that faith formation isn’t just for kids; it’s a life-long process.  I begin to get a vision of a church being a school for love, a love lab – where we learn to receive each other like we might receive a small child: sensitively, gently, joyfully with open arms.  A church becoming a place where we slowly learn to love people who are different from us, with whom we may disagree, with openness, vulnerability and forgiveness.  Where we are each transformed in the process, as prejudices and fears begin to fall away and new understandings about ourselves and the world emerge.  And we choose to involve ourselves in a church not because it gives us status, or makes us a more conscientious community member.  We come because we want to be re-formed as a person, as God’s beloved.  We become part of a congregation because we finally realize we want to change and grow.  We yearn to be that person with open arms, just like Jesus.   Amen.\\n  \\n\\t\\n\\xa0',\n",
       " '\\tI never met Jesus in person.  Does that surprise you?  Church tradition has said that the authors of Matthew Mark Luke and John were all disciples of Jesus.  Nope.  Jesus was arrested and killed before most of us were born!  But so many stories about him and his teachings were passed down by his family, by his friends, those who started to follow his Way. Then people started to write them down, but not until decades after he died!  But here’s the thing: what we all wrote about Jesus was NOT meant to be an eyewitness account, like a journalist might write in the newspaper or on-line today.  None of us meant our particular account of the life and teachings of Jesus to be a historical record.  We were doing something else.  See, as we were each writing our Gospels, we were experiencing the presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst of our faith communities!  Jesus wasn’t someone who just lived long ago.  The Risen Jesus Christ, the Messiah, was an active presence in our life together.  Our relationship with his living spirit was challenging and changing us everyday!  The other writers and I were trying to describe something so huge, we often had to resort to metaphor, poetry, symbolic language.  As your Native American storytellers say, “this may not be exactly how it happened, but I know that it is true.”  Like any really important story, we were trying to give you the bigger picture….of something that really was quite amazing and even mysterious.  Why was Jesus born?  What was God up to here?  Why did Jesus have such a powerful affect on people?  \\n\\tThrough the style of my writings, and the events I refer to, Biblical scholars figure I wrote my book in around 80 or 90 CE.  They can also tell that I am a Jewish, Greek speaking, Christian. I lived in Antioch, on the border of present day Turkey and Syria.  Busy cosmopolitan area, on the ancient Silk Route, and was filled with both Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity. Our community was deeply influenced by the spread of the Hellenistic civilization, and most of us spoke Greek. But I am Jewish in origin, some people think I was a Pharisee an expert on Jewish law, Torah and how to apply it to everyday life.  Certainly I am knowlegable about Jewish law.  It’s lifeblood runs through my book. The motivating force in my writing this gospel was really to say “this man Jesus is the one we, the Jewish community, have been waiting for all these years…this is the Messiah….the one who will come to save Israel.” That’s why I quote the Hebrew scriptures, what you call the Old Testament, so much throughout my book. \\nIn my book, I describe God’s mighty works and divine disclosures through Jesus and the people around him.  I wanted to remind my people that God was still doing all this in their midst.\\n\\tWhen I tell this to modern day churches, some people say they are wary of sounding so presumptuous; they hesitate to say God is doing this or that in their midst.  I tell them: Oh, come on! Don’t be so tentative and polite!  You are not running a civic organization or a social fraternity, this is the Body of Christ here at the corner of Holton and Garden!  Claim God’s mighty works in your midst! The healing and forgiveness and self-sacrifice and reaching out to those in need that goes on in the midst Falcon Heights Church….claim it!  I hear that you are well into your search for a new settled pastor.  As part of that process, you’re discerning what God is calling this church to next, getting clear about your vision and setting some priorities.  Does that sound audacious?  Claiming to discern God’s movement among you!    How wonderfully bold and risky of all of you!\\n\\t I do include some extravagant details in my birth narrative, I must say, all with important symbolic meaning. Angels!  Wild dreams! Unlikely parents!   Long journey and miraculous birth! A star!  Exotic wise men from the East!  A wicked king!  Action, camera – is that how you say it?!  Actually, only Luke and I include details of Jesus’ birth in our gospels.  We both believed that the most important moment in Jesus’ earthly life, when he actually became the Son of God, was at his conception.   But instead of dwelling on Mary, like Luke does, I focus my story Joseph, the brave Jewish man who becomes Jesus’ earthly father.\\n\\tThe long geneology at the beginning of my book?  I wanted to show that Joseph was related all the way back to important Jewish leaders, like David and Abraham.  I also even a few women of suspicisious repute, to show that God can work through just about anybody to get God’s job done.  But was Joseph actually Jesus’ father?  Hmmmmm…… Did you know that in my time, Jewish law dictated that paternity was based on the man’s acknowledgement of the child.  If a man takes his betrothed to live in his parent’s home (the final stage of getting married) and assumes responsibility for a mother and a child, he is the father.  If a man goes so far as to name a child, as the angel directed Joseph to do, the man was acknowledging that baby as his own.  Now any one of you who has adopted a child, or served as a step-parent, will know what I am talking about.  I guess I really admired Joseph, being that he could have simply divorced Mary without a lot of fuss; he was clearly afraid to take her into his parent’s home.   But he sensed that God was calling him to more than just familiar legal requirements.  God was asking him to make a decision before all the information was there.  Hmmmm…..I guess this happens to all of us, sometimes, doesn’t it?  We feel we have to take a risk and make a decision before  we know all of the consequences. Your pastoral search committee will do their best to learn about each respective candidate, but you will not know this person fully by any means before you are asked to vote on his or her call as your new pastor.  Risky business, this Jesus stuff, I must say.  Since my day, the church has come up with some beautiful songs to describe this mysterious risk-taking his parents did at Jesus’ birth.  Join me as we sing together this tender song about Joseph and Mary, each asked by God to take a risk and to move into the unknown. (sing hymn)  BREAK…\\n\\tWho were those people from the east who came to visit Jesus?  And what about this awful King Herod?  Pastor Anne will tell you why I included this awful puppet ruler of the Roman occupiers, during her January 1 sermon celebrating the Feast of Epiphany.  But the star, I have to tell you about this really cool detail!  In ancient times, important people’s birth was often heralded by an astronomical surprise: a comet’s sudden appearance, the alignment of two planets in a blazing orb.  I meant for these exotic visitors to remind people of Zorastrian priests from Persia, who had a special group of starwatchers called the magi.  For my congregation, these folks were definitely outside the fold.  Not familiar to much of anyone.  See, my church community was starting to welcome new people into its midst, like Greek speaking gentiles that we Jewish folks didn’t really know or understand.  You know how this can be; it’s unsettling to mix with people of different customs and traditions.  How is it that they can follow Jesus with us?  But the magi were some of the first to recognize who Jesus was!  \\n\\tAnd these foreigners heard God speaking to them in the world around them, not just scripture or tradition.  And you know that don’t you?  How it is God sometimes seems more present, more compelling, when you are in certain outdoor spots on this planet.  You can see it in your minds’ eye.  A quiet lake at sunrise, the blaze of a sunset, the deep green of the woods, a warm beach with crashing waves.\\n\\tI wanted to show and inspire my own people how humble, fallible and very human folks take risks to be part of God’s work in the world.  I wanted people to see that God can speak to them through just about anything, especially when we take some risks.  Especially when we are paying attention to the grandeur and mystery of the natural world around us.  My hope and prayer is that my writings will inspire you too.  Remember that God is always eager use to each of us in bringing about the God’s reign of compassion and justice and peace.  \\n\\tWhat a pleasure to time-travel and speak with you today.  Let’s sing one more of your beautiful Christmas carols.  “Lo how a rose is blooming, from Jesse’s root has sprung.” I love how this one talks of Jesus bursting forth from Jesse’s lineage.  Right out of the geneology in my gospel story!.   Jesse, the little known sheep-herder and father of the boy who would become King David.   It’s true you know, God can work through any of us.  Shall we sing together?\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n  hi\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'A GRATITUDE ATTITUDE\\n\\tIn the midst of a week filled with pastoral concerns about our beloved church member, Chuck Michaelson, and his family, as well as tracking combined fury of Hurricane Matthew and the presidential campaign, I’ve also been following another story.  I’ve been watching a drama unfold at First Congregational Church United Church of Christ in Berkeley, one I knew well from my years of ministry in northern California.  For over 125 years this big urban church has been a center of theological liberalism and social justice leadership in the San Francisco Bay area.  Sitting on the edge of the UC Berkeley campus, the congregation has  been on the forefront of fighting for women’s suffrage to rights of interned Japanese Americans, civil rights, nuclear disarmament, and more recently partnering with Black Lives Matters to address continuing racial injustice. Last week, several of the church’s buildings were accidentally destroyed by a roof construction fire and the main Sanctuary sustained considerable water damage.  In the midst of this sudden devastation, their Senior Minister, Molly Phinney Baskette, asked in a pastoral letter to remind her congregation: are we paying pay close attention to the story we are telling about this event?  She asks, do we tell a story about fear or a story about hope?  Following this last week’s terrible fire, will this be a time of hunkering down for them as a church, of restricting programming and staff under the weight of costly repairs?  She noted that “A few of the TV news channels, which love to light up the lizard brain to spike ratings, told the story of fear: heartbreaking devastation, toddlers from our nonexistent day care fleeing the building, danger of building collapse. They weren’t really interested in our composure.”  Our public statements “about resiliency and strength, about people being more important than things, about vision for the future, didn’t make their newscasts,” she continued.  She describes how one of their church musicians “encountered white supremacists demonstrating Friday night near our church, preaching that the fire was an act of God in retribution for our Black Lives Matter banner. They were selling a vengeful God, a border-wall God, the God whose love is scarce and finite….But you,” she writes to her people, “you have been telling the hope story of our fire. You are honoring your grief and your memories, but not letting them get in the way of believing forward that God will do great things among us.\\n\\tI come to our texts this morning, wondering how God will continue to do great things among us.  We have just lost a beloved and key lay leader in Chuck’s death yesterday.  We are called to believe “forward that God will do great things among us” says Rev. Phinney Baskette.  Looking at our text from Hebrew scriptures this morning, I wonder how on earth was the prophet Jeremiah able to believe forward and speak of how God would continue to do great things among the Jewish people.  He sends word to to those who had been dragged from Jerusalem and exiled to Babylon: “5Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce…have sons and daughters…seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the\\xa0Lord\\xa0on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.”  In a time of fear, where does hope come from?\\n\\tThis passage from Luke is a story of hopeful things happening to fearful people.  How do you “believe forward that God will do great things among you” if you have leprosy?  In those days, people afflicted with leprosy were feared by their surrounding society; they were seen as sinful, unclean, and outside of God’s grace.  If you happened to somehow get cured of an illness like leprosy, you were required to see a Temple priest for a special cleansing ritual.  Only then would make you be spiritually fit to rejoin the community as a healed, clean and whole person. \\nThis story of Jesus healing these feared lepers carries a surprise for the first century listeners in Palestine:  they would be not only shocked to see hopeful things happening to feared lepers.  They would be surprised to hear polite, grateful words coming from the Samaritan leper.  The Samaritan, the foreigner who is not liked or appreciated by the Jews (and the feeling was mutual for the Samaritans), is the only person in the story who says “thank-you” for his healing. He steps forward and falls at Jesus feet, praising God.  Jesus wonders out loud, so the crowd won’t miss it: “weren’t there 10 of you?  Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”  Again, the person we would least expect, an outcast person from hated and feared Samarian, is the one who acts graciously, expressing deep gratitude.  He is the one whose faith doesn’t sit within him like an inert block of belief.  His faith is a verb; he is acting faithfully as he expresses his gratitude.  Something about this has made him well.  \\n\\tWhat is it about gratitude that might bring healing and hope?  What does gratefulness do to fear?  Researchers have studied the phenomena of gratitude, in part because they were skeptical about the recent outpouring of popular books on the subject.  Many of these books have claimed that “a life oriented around gratefulness is the panacea for insatiable yearnings and life’s ills.” (Emmons and McCullough, p. 377).   So two social science professors, Robert A. Emmons and Michael E. McCullough, conducted a study on “Gratitude and Thankfulness Dimensions.” They explored whether or not a grateful outlook had a measurable effect on psychological and physical  well-being. Did it really reduce fear and anxiety in people?  They looked at the difference between “counting your blessings” and “counting your burdens.”   Is it any wonder that they discovered that when people regulary make a weekly listing of life’s blessings things seemed better?  The study revealed that these people had “a more positive and optimistic appraisal of one’s life, more time spent exercising and fewer reported physical symptoms.” (p. 386).  “Grateful people are more likely to acknowledge a belief in the interconnectedness of all life and a commitment to and responsibility to others” (McCullough et. al., 2002). \\n\\tThe researchers also noticed a curious “spiraling effect” where the “experience of gratitude, and the actions they did when they felt grateful, built and strengthen social bonds and friendships.” (p. 388)  And then they would end up feeling more grateful….and more connected….and more grateful.   I know tht if I spend a good portion of my day grumbling, fretting and counting my many burdens, I am not good company for anyone. And then I have even more things to complain about!  \\n\\tAs I reread the passage from Jeremiah in light of these thoughts about gratitude, I realized that the prophet was telling the Jewish people pretty much the same thing.  Their country overrun by the Assyrians, they had been dragged off to live in exile in Babylon.  They had lost their beautiful city Jerusalem and their religious center the Temple.  They had cause to be fearful and wonder whether or not they could connect with God at all in this foreign land.  They felt abandoned, deserted, overwhelmed.  Jeremiah proclaims that God wants them settle in, to marry and work and contribute to the welfare of their new rulers, the Babylonians.  And in doing so, in connecting with their surroundings and gratefully acknowledging what was there in the midst of the difficulties, they too would prosper.  “You are connected to your captors; pray for them. Be here…be here in what is right in front of you…pay attention to it, connect with it…I am here with you,” says God.  \\n\\tGratitude is not necessarily a cure for everything, like clinical depression or cancer, poverty or deep grief.    But something about saying “thanks” and acknowledging the things we are grateful for, changes us. The congregation of First Church Berkeley is experiencing this reality, even now: Gratefulness that no one was injured, gratefulness for the firefighters, for strangers sending money for the rebuilding fund, for a willingness to dig in but not hunker down in fear. The gratitude study reveals that even before we actually experience this positive emotion, in giving thanks we will start to think more clearly; we get more flexible and creative in our thinking, which in turn helps us deal with stress and adversity better (p.388).  Our attitude shifts and we start to feel more grateful. \\n\\tThe feared and perhaps fearful outsider, the marginalized Samaritan man who turned back and fell at Jesus’ feet, knew this.   He acknowledged his connectedness to Jesus, his receiving of something of value.  He thanked and praised God, and all of this changed him.   Blessings surround us, in the midst of all that is wrong in this world.  It is ours to pay attention and give thanks; allowing fear to be replaced with hope.   Amen.',\n",
       " \"\\tBut frankly, things have seemed alot more «weedy» than usuall.  Ongoing humanitarian crisis and governmental policy challenge with the flooding of unaccompanied immigrant children across our borders.  Escalation of violence between Palestine and Israel, and bizarrely, a downed civilian passanger plane over Ukraine.   Specific stories of one child from Hondorous, a young mother from Palestine, a teenager from Israel, an AIDS researcher from the Netherlands begin to overwhelm me….and I wonder about God's presence and plan in all this. While in conversation with one of you eariler this week, in the middle of a busy coffee shop, I was asked the perenniel difficult question:  why is there so much evil in this world?  I sighed heaviliy before responding. why is there so much evil in the world, so much seemingly meaningless suffering?  We talked together about solidairity with those who suffere, prayerful attention.  About accountability and confronting bullies worldwide and close to home.   \\n\\tJesus had a knack for answering questions like this by going sideways:  he would draw word pictures for people, in order to explain truths that may not seem obvious. 'The Kingdom, the reign of God is at hand!' he would begin. People would look around and see the Roman legions imposing control over their communities; they would see the rich getting richer and the lower classes struggling.  Evil was pervailing, as far as they could see.  «This Jesus keeps referencing the prophet Daniel and the writings of a future, escatological time when God's justice and peace will prevail in the world.  He says it is NOW.  Really?»  \\n\\tTo help people understand the reality God's liberating and healing activity in their midst, Jesus launches into a parable: The Kingdom of God is like….well, it's like soil and seeds and farming and growing!  His audiences were mostly workers of the land, closely familiar with the ways of an agrarian society.  But listening to Jesus' stories about soil and seeds this week and last week, one might conclude that God is one strange farmer!  For starters, why is the landowner, who obviously has his own servants to do the work, out in the field sowing seeds himself?  Wouldn't it be prudent to let your servants do the planting?  Jesus' listeners would know that there were Roman laws against sowing darnel, or wheat-looking weeds, in someone's field.  They would remember the passage in the Hebrew Bible, in Leviticus, which states that planting weeds in a field turns the whole field into something that is ritually impure, that even gathering up the weeds can't change.  Eat the wheat from this field, and you will be impure or unclean and cannot participate in Temple worship.  \\nAt this point in Jesus ministry, followers and non-followers of his teaching are starting to rub up against each other, in neighborhoods, in the synagogues, within families.  Wheat and weeds in the same field, you might say.  How could God be present in this situation, if all these unbelievers and no-goods were allowed to co-exist with believers and righteous people?  It's a quick jump from here to the good-evil binary way of looking at the world.  Hearing this story, Jesus' listeners are really going to wonder just why the owner wants to leave all the weeds there.\\n\\tKaroline Lewis, a professor at Luther Seminary in St. Paul,  writing on the WorkingPreacher blog commented on this passage: good and evil do manage to co-exist in the world but humans seem to have a propensity for develping «full blown plans to eradicate all evil at every turn.»  We must somehow «seekout and purge all sin and evil.»  Lest we think this is only the tendency of people more extreme that us, she suggests we each watch how we privately respond to certain news stories.  I am hardly consider myself reactionary, but I have all kinds of irradication fantasies about how I would save the world from evil caused by political extremism and repressivereligious views.  And I find myself with all kinds of assumptions about what is grossly misguided, uneducated, unsophisticated, naively primitive or just plain wrong when it comes to other people's religious views and spiritual practices, not to mention their politics and military actions.  I have had to notice that there is a certain  arrogance in my certainty and judgement, even though I try to keep it mostly to myself.  Enough about me….What goes on in your head when confronted by suffering, evil - the weeds- of the world?\\n\\tI would much prefer to think of myself as the wheat of this story: I'm fruitful in my labors and growing something helpful for Gods Kingdom.  I'm no slouch, I'm no WEED.  But Jesus seems to be saying that life is full of wheat and weeds all mixed together.  Lest we think wheat reigns supreme – all of it –wheat and weeds – is eventually transmorgraphied in the end.  The weeds by the gardener's fire and the wheat is crushed by the miller's stone, baked in the baker's oven and eventually passes throught the human digestive track!  For now, imperfect world, the good and bad existing side-by-side, is part of God's plan.   Clearly Jesus did not want us to take a side-line when it comes to suffering and injustice. But as Karoline Lewis notes,  our purpose is not to seek out and purge evil….our «purpose is to live the Gospel» - to be light when others want to snuff out the light of hope, compassion and justice.  To be salt when others favor blandness and conformity, uniformity and acquisensence to injustice.  To live out our Vision:  Many paths, traveling together…Emmaus United Church of Christ.\\n\\tWheat and weeds, all mixed together and all seeming to receive God's blessing of rain and sunshine.  God is strange in this way; God doesn't seem really picky; God will work with just about anyone.   Consider the story from Genesis for today.  Abraham's grandson, Jacob, was of questionble character, a real 'weed' if we think about it.  Part of it was his mother Rebekah's fault; she talked Jacob into this contrived scheme to steal his older brother Esau's birthright and their father's deathbed blessing.  But Jacob basically acts like an overempowered trickster and a cheat.  But after Jacob has lied and fooled his father, and now is escaping from his brother Esau's understandable fury, he ends up receiving God's blessing! He has this strange vision in his sleep of angelic divine messengers traipsing up and down between heaven and earth, - a vision full of movement - and God suddenly appearing right next to him!  ''Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.''  Land, descendents, the blessing of protective presence, and the opportunity to become a light of justice and hope, a blessing to all the nations. Is it little wonder Jacob wakes up from this dream and exclaims, ''surely the LORD is in this place – and I did not know it!''\\t\\n\\tSometimes in the middle of our human condition, work, families, this church, filled with wheat and weeds all mixed together, we wonder if God is here at all.  But God is in this place!  Is God big on sorting out the good from the bad and sending the evil ones off to somekind of accountbility, maybe a bit of firey damnation? Well, we just don't know how it will all end up.  But in the Empire of God, now says Jesus, the good mixes with the bad.  Yes, it is «contested space» - and within it, we are the one's who seek to do God's will.\\n\\tGod worked God's purposes through some pretty questionable characters throughout Biblical history, and seems to still do that today.  Jesus reminds us that while the arrival of God's good future is assured, the way from here to there is strewn with people making mistakes, with sin and unbelief.   So we might notice this week when we find ourselves making distinctions between good and bad people, when judgementalism creeps into our tone. This is the Good, but perhaps unsettling, News for today; the wheat and the weeds are mixed together for now, and it’s our job to live together peacefully and productively.  God will sort it out in the end.Many paths, traveling together….Emmaus UCC. A vision full of movement.   All of us working together in this imperfect world, grateful once for God’s guiding and protective presence…this presence that united us in Christ and in Christ’s mission.   Thanks be to God!  Amen.\",\n",
       " 'Today’s text from Luke brings a story of two people actually seeing each other and consequently, envisioning a different future.  The unexpected encounter is between Jesus and a tax collector named Zaccheaus.  Zacchaeus was certainly not someone likely to challenge the status quo.  He was a Chief tax collector and rich. have made him ritually impure and unfit to worship in the Jewish Temple.  He held a position of authority and wealth as a top employee of the occupying imperial force, the Roman government. But his dealings with a foreign power deemed him unclean, and unable to worship in the Temple.  He cleared a huge profit from his work.  But he did this at great cost, for he was shunned by his local Jewish community.                                                              \\tBut apparently Zaccheus has heard about unusual teacher and healer, and now with the news of Jesus’ arrival in Jericho, Zaccheus is: “trying to see who Jesus was.” The phrase is probably better translated “he had been repeatedly seeking.”  But Zacchaeus is hesitant, as he knows he is not welcomed in the crowd.  Yes, he is described as small in stature, but I wonder if he went up the tree in part because tree branches can be a convenient hiding place.  Now he can see Jesus, he can see the future walking towards him, but he stays safe up in the tree.\\n\\tI can relate.  Sometimes the future is walking right towards me, and I would rather “stay up in a tree” of avoidance or busyness, of not paying attention, or simply not seeing.  Hiding there in the safe leafy branches of my routines, my assumptions and comfort zones.  I admit that I have done this with some recent news stories that, until this last week, I have skimmed, felt sad and powerless about and then mostly ignored.  I’m talking in particular about the news out of Standing Rock, North Dakota.  The people from hundreds of Indian Tribes, Bands and First Nation groups, from across the US and Canada that have joined the Standing Rock Souix Reservation people to challenge the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.  A planned pipeline connector that was diverted around the majority white community of Bismark, due to residents fears about water contaimantion.  The pipleline is now slated to snake across Indian land threatening their water sources, violating established treaty rites, and destroying sacred cultural and burial sites.  500,000 barrels of crude would flow per day from North Dakota\\'s Bakken oil field, across the Standing Rock land, to Illinois. \\n\\tIn the last few days, I have had to acknolwedge that all of this current action is happening within the wider, grievous history of our genocide against Native people…. because my ancestors wanted their land.  It’s easy to keep these struggles out of sight and out of mind, especially when I don’t feel directly impacted.  Yes, I so want to “stay up in my tree” on this one because I feel guilty that I haven’t been paying enough attention, and when I start actually seeing, I get easily overwhelmed.  But then on last Thursday a massive police and National Guard action dismantled the self-identified non-violent “protectors” encampment, and over 125 people were arrested.  And then on Friday I’m in a clergy meeting with our UCC MN Conference Minister, Rev. Shari Prestemon, and she announces she is traveling to Stand Rock to join 4 other UCC Conference Minisiters to give peaceful clergy witness to the struggle, to provide protective witness in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and with the water protectors. (http://www.clergyclimateaction.org/clergy_standing_with_standing_rock) But how might I “come down out of my tree” when it comes to this ongoing contentious action at Standing Rock?  Yes, our congregation donates food and clothing to the Department of Indian Works of Interfaith Action in St. Paul.  But going forward, how do we “come down out of our tree” regarding the on-going marginalization of Native people in our nation?  \\nZaccheus stays up in the tree, craning his neck to see Jesus, until Jesus himself somehow spots him.  Do I really believe that the Spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ sees me?  Jesus calls out Zaccheaus’ name and acknowledges him, and invites himself to this local outcast’s house for dinner.  Can you and I hear Jesus naming and acknowleging us, inviting himself into the intimacy of our homes   and individual hearts?  The crowd is scandalized by Jesus; honored rabbis do not go and eat with sinners; it will make them ritually impure.  But because Jesus sees this man, and clearly recognizes all that he is and accepts him, Zacchaeus is able to respond. \\nI believe that the spirit of the living Jesus Christ spots me in my “tree” of avoidance, of overwhelm, of hopelessness when it comes to the whole Standing Rock situation and our history with the Native people of this land.  And so are each of you, in whatever darn tree you happen to be stuck in at the moment.  Zacchaeus bravely comes down out of his tree, moves out of his place of security as a wealthy cheater of his community.  “I’m going to give half my possessions to the poor and repay those I have defrauded.”  This tax collector was not unlike all the brave people who step forward and say,  “I am going to be more than I am right now; I’m going to look into the future and see something new in myself, in my church; I’m going to see something new in these marginalized people who are outcast in our community.”  How might we, as a church, better understand and give witness to what is going on in Standing Rock?  I’d love to hear your ideas.  \\nToday we celebrate Martin Luther and the other reformers: the people who saw something new and envisioned a church more accessible to common people.  Jesus saw something new as he looked at Zacchaeus; a generous and honest man emerging out of a hated tax collector.  The Spirit of the Living Jesus Christ sees us hiding up in our trees, where we may be trying to get a better view but we are not quite committed to the future at hand.  Jesus invites us to come on down, and engage God’s work of justice and mercy in new, risky ways. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Talk About #NoDAPL: A Native Perspective\\nFriday, 28 October 2016 00:00By\\xa0, Truthout | Op-Ed\\nThe public witnessed a new level of escalation\\xa0on Thursday\\xa0in the Native struggle at Standing Rock, as police swept through an encampment in the direct path of the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL). The resulting standoff with the National Guard, and police officers from various states, led to 117 arrests. Advancing authorities attacked Water Protectors with flash grenades, bean bag launchers, pepper spray and Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs). There were also numerous reports of police beating Water Protectors, and reports of live ammunition being used.\\xa0\\nSuch developments were incredibly disturbing, both to those present and to Natives who were actively watching from a distance, but the raid itself was not unexpected. In fact, there was a great deal of suspicion that the police would close in the day before, which led me to reach out to a number of my friends on the frontlinesWednesday. Amid our conversations about their feelings and recent experiences at the camps, I asked my friends if there was anything they wanted shared in writing. What follows is grounded in the substance of those conversations. These ideas are obviously not representative of all Native perspectives on the subject, because our convictions are as diverse as that of any peoples. But it’s a perspective we thought was worthy of expression.\\nIt is crucial that people recognize that Standing Rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence. The Dakota Access pipeline (#NoDAPL) is a front of struggle in a long-erased war against Native peoples -- a war that has been active since first contact, and waged without interruption. Our efforts to survive the conditions of this anti-Native society have gone largely unnoticed because white supremacy is the law of the land, and because we, as Native people, have been pushed beyond the limits of public consciousness.\\n\\nThe harms committed against us have long been relegated to the history books. This erasure has occurred for the sake of both white supremacy and US mythology, such as American exceptionalism. It has also been perpetuated to sustain the comfort of those who benefit from harms committed against us. Our struggles have been kept both out of sight and out of mind -- easily forgotten by those who aren\\'t directly impacted.\\nIt should be clear to everyone that we are not simply here in those rare moments when others bear witness.\\nTo reiterate what should be obvious: We are not simply here when you see us.\\nWe have always been here, fighting for our lives, surviving colonization, and that reality has rarely been acknowledged. Even people who believe in freedom frequently overlook our issues, as well as the intersections of their issues with our own.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when you talk about Standing Rock, please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact the residents of Bismarck, North Dakota. When Bismarck\\'s population -- which is over 90 percent white -- objected to the risks the pipeline posed to their drinking water, their concerns were accommodated, and the pipeline route was shifted into treaty lands. Please inform people of these facts, and remind them that our people are still struggling to survive the violence of colonization on many fronts. People should not simply engage with stories related to our struggles when they see a concrete connection to their own issues -- or a jumping off point to discuss their own issues. Our friends, allies and accomplices should be fighting alongside us because they value our humanity and right to live, in addition to whatever else they believe in.\\n\\nAmy Goodman article: http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37507-dakota-access-pipeline-company-attacks-native-americans-with-dogs-and-pepper-spray\\nOn Saturday in North Dakota, security guards working for the Dakota Access pipeline company attacked Native Americans with dogs and pepper spray as they resisted the $3.8 billion pipeline\\'s construction. If completed, the Dakota Access pipeline would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude per day from North Dakota\\'s Bakken oil field to Illinois, where it would meet up with an existing pipeline that would carry the oil all the way down to Texas. The pipeline has faced months of resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and members of nearly 100 more tribes from across the US and Canada. On Friday, lawyers for the tribe filed documents showing how the very land where Dakota Access would bulldoze on Saturday was, in fact, a tribal burial site. Democracy Now! was on the ground on Saturday, and we bring you this exclusive report.\\n\\nStanding Rock: A Clergy Call to Action Energy Transfer Partners began construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in May 2016, but the company\\'s plans have hit a snag.\\xa0\\nIn late July, the Army Corps of Engineers granted permits for the pipeline to cross beneath the Missouri and Cannon Ball Rivers\\xa0without approvalfrom the Standing Rock Sioux.\\nBy late August 2016,\\xa0more than 1500 people, mostly Native Americans, had responded to the tribe\\'s\\xa0call to action\\xa0and converged at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to protect against construction of \"the black snake.\" In an historic show of solidarity, 188 First Nations and American Indian tribes have\\xa0united in opposition.\\nAlso in August, Youth from Standing Rock\\xa0completed\\xa0a 2000-mile relay run to Washington, D.C., to bring the message of their\\xa0#RezpectOurWatercampaign to the White House, in their own show of opposition.\\xa0\\nThe Dakota Access pipeline would run through the Dakotas and Iowa to Illinois, where oil would be sent to\\xa0East Coast markets by train\\xa0or to the Gulf Coast via another Energy Transfer Partners pipeline being converted to carry oil.\\xa0\\n\\nTo the broader church:\\n\\nAs Christians, we, the undersigned clergy, are conditioned by the gospel to stand on the side of the persecuted and the jailed. As such, we are compelled by our faith to stand with the water protectors of Standing Rock, who have pricked the conscience of a nation and the world. In opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline that would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois, they have resolutely declared that they are not protestors but protectors and defenders acting out of a sacred obligation which affirms “water is life.”\\nIn a pattern familiar to our faith, they have stood as peacemakers while government authorities and hate-filled hecklers deride them as criminals, rioters, and terrorists. With moral indignation, we have watched as children, women, and men have joined in prayer and song only to suffer at the hands of those wielding batons and pointing rifles. \\xa0With justified outrage, we have heard of how those arrested have been strip-searched and humiliated. With acute offence, we have witnessed an escalating, militarized response to acts of nonviolence.\\xa0 We have witnessed multiple law enforcement agencies and the National Guard protecting the brazen and wanton acts of corporate powers determined to have their way. As these events unfold, we are aware of the context of race that defines this reality. In\\xa0a letter\\xa0to the Attorney General, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II writes, “This country has a long and sad history of using military force against indigenous people–including the Sioux Nation.”\\nFor these reasons and more, we have joined together as clergy to issue two calls:\\n\\nTo our fellow clergy who are able to travel, we invite you to join with other clergy in Standing Rock on November 2nd\\xa0and 3rd. As the Rev. John Floberg of the Episcopal Church\\xa0writes in his appeal to clergy of all denominations, “Our vision is a day of protective witness in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and with the water protectors.” If you are unable to join with other clergy on these dates but would like to come later in the fall or winter when support will still be needed, please coordinate with the\\xa0, the Environmental Justice Minister for the United Church of Christ.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'CONVERTED HEARTS\\n\\n\\tThese two Bible stories are admittedly startling: A man riding along blinded by a light then hearing voices and falling off his horse?  A supposidly dead Jesus appearing again to his followers, this time with a bizarre multi-fish miracle, Peter putting on his clothes to jump in the water, Jesus BBQing breakfast on a beach?  Did these events really happen? In a diverse congregation such as ours, we will have a range of opinions and beliefs about this.  I suggest we look at what the authors of the Book of Acts and the Gospel of John may have been trying to do by including these tales.   Which means we may have to drop our 21st century notion of “accurate reporting” and listen more imaginatively and deeply.  Because something else is going on here….\\t\\n\\tI suggest we start with this question that was addressed to the disciple Peter by Jesus:  “do you love me?” Have you ever been asked this question:  “Do you love Jesus?”   This may seem like an unusual idea, or, perhaps this is a familiar question from your religious upbringing.  There are a number of Christian communities where members greet each other regularly with personal questions about one’s relationship with Jesus: “how is your walk with Jesus going these days?”   Maybe you have experienced questions such as these as a litmus test, a way of ferreting out if you were really saved.  Do you love Jesus?  I dare say it is not a question that reflects the piety or practice of the four European Protestant traditions that make up the United Church of Christ.  Does it make us feel  uncomfortable, our personal space a bit invaded, leaving our mind a tad befuddled?  Ask yourself, “Do I love Jesus?”  What goes through your mind?  What kind of feelings come up for you?\\n“But what would this mean, if I loved Jesus?  How would I know if I do? Why is this even important to discuss?”  Try to stay with the initial question to your very own self, “Do you love Jesus?” as we ponder today’s scriptures together. \\nLet’s consider the Acts tale of Saul of Tarsus, who will later be identified by his Roman name, Paul and become a major spokesperson for the early church.  Saul, a learned Jew and son of a Roman citizen, never met the historical Jesus.  But he apparently hated Jesus’ increasingly bold followers.  By this point in the mid-first century, the synagogues are having a problems continuing to incorporate either Jewish Christians or the growing number of Gentile Christians into their traditions and belief systems.   Saul had joined forces with those teachers of the Law who believed that the followers of Jesus were misguided and were a liability for the whole community.   \\nBut, on route to Damascus, Saul is suddenly overwhelmed with brilliant light and a voice: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”  The voice, audible to both Saul and his traveling companions, identifies itself as Jesus:  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting!”  Saul is blinded by the encounter and is instructed to proceed to Damascus and await further instructions.    There he is healed by one of the disciples, is baptized and begins to proclaim the Risen Jesus in the synagogues.  An astonishing turn-around.  We might wonder: What converts such enmity into affirmation?  At the extreme: What changes the actions of hate into love?\\nHas there been a time when this has happened in your own life?  A time when clinging to old patterns, problematic and settled ways of seeing and doing things, just did not work anymore:  Assumptions like… seeing our parents as the source of our own adult problems.   Thinking we can persist in our increasing use of a certain mind-altering chemical on a daily basis.  Bad-mouthing a previous spouse, misrepresenting our financial reality on our taxes, continually complaining about one friend to another friend.  The dissolving can happen slowly over time; or we get radically “carved-out” by a disappointment, a failure, a loss….and finally realize we have clung to old certitudes, ingrained habits, that no longer serve.  It’s like the light comes on.  Wow, we mutter to ourselves, I’m seeing this totally differently!  \\nOn the road to Damascus, Saul is blinded by a flash of light and collapses. There comes a time when something seems to throw us to the ground; it converts us.  And if we are smart, we start groping around towards something new, stretching out towards the healing, moving from the self-recrimination, the distain of others, towards something very different.   \\nWhen we find Peter with a group of the other disciples by the Sea of Tiberias in today’s passage from John, its almost as if Jesus’ being among them had never happened. I can just imagine Peter turning dejectedly to his companions: “well….so much for being ‘fishers of men and women.’  I’m going back to fishing for fish.”  They put out their boat and labor all night.  But no fish.  \\nWhat is odd in John’s narrative is that the Gospel writer has already described several resurrection appearances up to this point.  These people, among others, have already encountered the Risen Jesus, talked with him, had the Holy Spirit breathed on them, been commissioned to go out and forgive in Jesus name.   But here, they don’t even recognize the stranger who calls out from the beach, saying: “hey, let your nets down on the other side of your boat.”  They start to strain against the huge load of fish in their nets, Abundance, overwhelming fish abundance, slithering out onto the deck.  “I have come that you might have abundant life,” Jesus used to tell them. And suddenly a switch flips in Peter; it’s like a light goes on and Peter shouts, “It is the Lord!”  He throws himself into the water, thrashing towards shore, groping towards something,….Someone.  \\nBefuddled, the rest of the disciples do not understand until they actually have eaten breakfast together with the stranger on the beach. “Come and have breakfast,” says Jesus. Come and eat the most important meal of your day…of your life, really.  Come, break your fasting, your denial of what you need; break your pattern of scarcity thinking.  “Come and have breakfast,” says Love.  And suddenly, the light goes on for them.\\nWiping crumbs from their beards, they probably began to talk.  Jesus is here with them; they have been knocked to the ground, thrown down from their assumptions that this “inclusive and merciful and present Kingdom of God” stuff was all over.  “Well, we figured we would just go back to fishing for fish,” they try to explain.  Jesus gazes at them with such tenderness, such compassion.  And then, the question: “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks.   \\n“What?  Why, yes, Lord; you know that I love you,” Peter answers, perhaps remembering the first time he denied even knowing Jesus during those terrifying hours following Jesus’ arrest.  \\n“Ah…well then feed my lambs,” says Jesus.  \\n“Feed your lambs…?” Peter scratches his head.  “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks again.  “Well, yeah, you know I love you!”  Peter mumbles, remembering how he lied to that woman in the Temple courtyard that awful day.  \\n“Tend my sheep,” replies Jesus.   All the disciples are staring at the two of them; what is going on here?   But now Jesus is asking Peter again;  “Do you love me?”  And the light of comprehension starts dawning even brighter.   Peter finally sinks deep into the reality of his own forgiven self.  It’s as though Jesus is saying: “I am seeing you Peter, for all that you have been and all that you are.  I am loving you, Peter.  Can you open to that, can you stop clinging to your sorry old failed self?  Can you love me back?  Peter, do you love me?”  \\nAnd it all comes crashing down for Peter, doesn’t it?  “Lord, you know everything;” he cries.  “You know how I abandoned not only you, but how I abandoned that best self I came to be as your disciple.  You know it all, and you still want me to go out in your name and fish for people and forgive and tend and feed all those who hunger for you.  You know everything.  You know that I love you.”  \\nMaybe this is what conversion really looks like.  It isn’t suddenly having an intellectual certainty about a creed or belief or theological concept.  For whatever reason, a light goes on.  And in that dawning awareness, there is an opening of our hearts to seeing ourselves and reality differently.  We may finally begin to see how the Risen Jesus is seeing us.  Come and get back to basics, says Jesus.  Come and eat breakfast; take in this nourishment that I know you and forgive and love you.  Such compassion for us, such eagerness that we will join him in the tending and feeding of those who hunger for God.  We are forgiven and restored to wholeness, so we can turn to this larger question Jesus asks of each of us: “Do you love me?”   \\nIt’s certainly a risky question to answer, because we won’t be able to just sit on the beach, all cozy around the fire.  Affirming our love for Jesus will always send us out.  We aren’t just asked to be like Jesus, to adhere to his teachings.  We are asked to follow him.  “Follow me,” Jesus says at the end of this encounter.  Not just a dead hero and teacher, but a living presence.  That’s what the Gospel writers themselves were experiencing.  That’s what they wanted to record.  Loving Jesus will invite us to move deeper into God’s hurting world, to forgive and to feed and to tend.    And we can thank God for that.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tWhat a joy to celebrate our musicians today: Allison and Greg as our paid staff here at Emmaus.  All who volunteer their time week after week to share their musical gifts for the glory of God and our mutual delight.   But the music we share together in this space, Sunday after Sunday, goes beyond our enjoyment, doesn’t it?  The purpose of worship is not to please us, it is to please God.  But the irony of worship is that if we are not at some level pleased, or stirred, somehow connected with, by the music in worship….little seems to happen for us.\\n\\tGraham Standish, a Presbyterian minister and author in Pennsyvania writes that we can no longer simply say that “worship is to please God.”  It’s too easy to dismiss this as an authoritarian command: who cares about pleasing God, why should I bother?  Rev. Standish claims that people need regular worship so they can be touched and opened.  Worship is about “encountering and experiencing God (in the company of others) in a way that transforms us, even if just a little bit.”  And you can’t do this without worship that makes a “spiritual and psychological impact on people.”  Whatever happens here has to resonate with us psychologically and spiritually, not just intellectually.  Otherwise, there are lots of other ways to spend a Sunday morning, that may even provide the transformative encounters with the Divine that we seek.  \\n\\tMost of us know how different kinds of music, either playing it or listening to it, can move us psychologically and spiritually.  And, as Rev. Standish points out, “each generation is difffernt in what it resonates with because over time the culture changes.  The result is that worship rooted in previous generations loses its power to connect with each succeeding generation and leads us to address spiritual questions that are no longer being asked, or at least not being asked in a way that can be addressed in forms familiar to today’s older generations.  \\n\\tI invite Boyd Post to share with us the ways in which music has helped him encounter and experience God through his life.  (BOYD SPEAKS)\\n\\tToday’s scripture reading comes from the end of the Gospel of Matthew, and records Jesus’ final words to his small group of disciples.  He tells them to go out and “make disciples of all nations,” baptizing them and passing on Jesus’ teachings.   Unfortunately, this passage can conjure up images of the worst of the Christian missionary movement down through the ages.  Indigenous people being forced to accept a religion completely foreign to their way of living in harmony with the world.   But there is a key here that is especially important to our congregation which values diversity and inclusivity within our community:  the word “nations” does not mean “nation-states” in the modern sense.  A better way to describe this would be “tribes of people who are not all like you” (Thomas Long, Feasting, p. 47).  Those who are different from us, who have different life experiences and perspectives….and who probably are pleased and stirred by different styles of music!   \\n\\tA huge part of our discipling, our learning to be followers of Jesus, happens to us in our worship together, week after week.  Its here that we should be “encountering and experiencing God in a way that transforms us, even if just a bit.”  Music is a huge part of of helping us  envisioning the world in a new way, “transcending ourselves and reaching beyond who we are.”  \\n\\tI invite Barbara Johnson to share with us now.

       " '\\tSuch a strange image in this passage from Acts:  a tablecloth-like fabric lowered from the sky holding all sort of non-kosher animals.  A nightmare for any orthodox Jew who followed the Torah’s kosher laws, as Peter did.  The original followers of Jesus, all Jews, were now scrambling to deal with Jesus’ message spreading beyond their inhouse, Jewish understanding of him as their Messiah, the Christ.  What do we do with these non-Jews, these Gentiles, who are drawn by Jesus’ message of compassion and justice?  Do they need to be circumcised and observe the Torah’s purity laws to be part of God’s plan?  What happens if we become truly diverse and inclusive in following the Way of Jesus?  Will the center hold?\\n\\tFor churches across the country, debate about diversity and inclusion has often focused on church music.  What kind of music is appropriate for communal worship, for praising God?  In a congregation that comprises 5 generations and hopes to grow it’s welcome to those age 40 and under?  Organ, traditional hymns, anthems from the classical era?  Piano and gospel?  Congas and world music?  Accoustic guitars and folk?  Jazz? Pop? Rap? New Age synthasizers? Electric guitars and rock-like praise music and projected lyrics on screens?  Thinking about these choices, I find it to be a curious and gentle irony that our “Joyful Noise Sunday” falls some four days after the death of the Minnesota music icon Prince.  I’ve been listening to radio retrospetives of his huge collection of work over the last few days, and to fellow musicians and music critics discussing the uniqueness of his creativity and the breath of his musicianship.   I was struck with their descriptions of the diversity of genres, Prince’s resistance to being slotted in one style, his innovation across different types of music.  And I got to thinking….there is a lesson for the church here.  God is bigger than one genre of music, and our praise and worship of God has got to be bigger, more expansive than one genre.   I sense this will be the challenge of the 21st century church, especially one such as Falcon Heights Church.  Not breaking off into different worship services for styles of music that cater to different preferences.  But holding our center by blending genres and styles in one common celebration each Sunday.  Worship as the place where all ages share the heart of our life together, and experience God’s presence more fully.  Where we courageously envision a new world of compassion and justice and are enabled to move out and make those changes happen.\\n\\tWe have invited a few of our choir members to testify to how different types of music have affected them spiritually and deepened their sense of connection with God.  After each testimony, I invite us to share our gratitude for their sharing by singing a verse of “When in Our Music God is Gloried.”  We hear first from Bob Olson. ',\n",
       " 'THE WITNESS OF MARY\\n\\nI occasionally worshipped at a Catholic Church with my friends when I was young. The stained glass, shadowy depths, and flickering candles were all quite foreign to me.  I remember a large statue of a blue robed lady up front near the altar.  I had never seen anything like this in the simple, sparse Congregational Churches of my childhood. And my Catholic friends’ had prayer cards with this lady’s picture on it; her name was“The Virgin.”  I wasn’t sure exactly what a “virgin” was.  Eventually I pieced together that the Mary in our little French crèche scene at home, Jesus’ mother, was the same person as the lady in blue at the Catholic church.   I wondered why Mary, except for the annual Christmas pageant, never came to our Protestant church. \\nThe Biblical references to Mary are amazingly few, given the eventual development of devotion to her and church doctrine about her.   Of all accounts of Jesus’ life and ministry, only the later gospel writers, Matthew and Luke, speak of Mary’s role in Jesus birth and claim that she was a young, unmarried virgin.  The whole rest of the New Testament, Paul’s letters and those of other early church missionaries, and the gospel writers Mark and John – none of them mention the virgin birth.   Miraculous births were quite common in the mythology of both the Greeks and the Romans.  But this belief about Mary was either unknown or simply not relevant to the earliest Christian writers, which I frankly find to be a relief.  I have known far too many people through my ministry who were turned off to the transformative power of the Christian message by the assumption that they had to believe in the virgin birth.  \\nI would be curious to learn how is it for each of you, when Mary steps on the stage of the Gospel story each Advent?   What do you make of her?  We encounter her today as a young virginal girl, barely a woman and engaged to Joseph.  In Luke’s text, she is described as being “perplexed “ when an angel greets her as a “favored one” and brings her this an astounding announcement.   While Matthew has this news come to Joseph in a dream, it is Luke who unfolds the full narrative of Mary’s encounter with the divine: not only will she conceive by the Holy Spirit, but her child will be “called the Son of the Most High…and will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”  “How can this be?” Mary asks the angel in surprise, and we might ask the same question.  I wonder if Mary was reacting less to the news of virginal conception and more to this coming of the Son of the Most High who would initiate God’s reign of compassion, salvation and hope? \\n\\tFor years I have been fascinated by how Western artists have depicted the angel Gabriel appearing to Mary.  Since the Middle Ages, rich and complex paintings of the Annunciation have been popular themes and teaching lessons about the virtues of purity and obedience.  As I looked at reproductions of some of these more famous paintings again this week, I couldn’t help but notice that so many of them show Mary in a startled and even defensive position.  An early medieval painting by Simone Martini has her pulling her cloak close around her neck and frowning at the angel.  Fra Angelico’s piece has Mary calmly meeting the angel’s gaze, but with both her arms protectively cover her mid section.   The Spaniard El Greco seats Mary in an wildly apocalyptic looking scene, under ominous, swirling clouds; her pale, mournful pale face and upraised hands push away the imposing angel.  Rembrandts’ pen and ink drawing has her almost shrouded by the angels huge wing; and with an overwhelmed look expression Mary leans away, again with the arms up protectively.  “Please Go Away” the Mary in each scene seems to say.  Leonardo da Vinci’s Mary appears interrupted in the middle of reading a book; she has a calm, intent expression as she watches the angel but holds her left hand up in what looks like the universal symbol for “halt!”  From the Netherlands, van Eyck paints her as looking away from the angel and with her hands thrown up in what has to be the universal stance for “What Ever!” \\nThese paintings have brought many people much joy and inspiration.  I simply find it curious that these depictions of Mary just didn’t seem to illustrate this scene we read Luke.  The artists’ Marys seem either shocked and harried, or defensive, reluctant, somber; they are often sad.  Luke’s Mary seems otherwise to me.  \\nIt wasn’t until I stumbled upon the American painter, Henry O. Tanner’s Annunciation that it occurred to me what seemed so odd about all the other  pieces I reviewed.  It is lesser known, but perhaps you have seen it and can call it to mind.  Painted in 1898, Tanner’s Annunciation depicts a simple scene of a young woman in a bare, first century Palestinian home. The room is hung with a plain tapestry of muted browns, ochre.  Mary is sitting on a bed-like couch covered with rumpled blankets.  Following her gaze as she looks off to the left of the painting, all we see of the angel is a golden, shimmering shaft of light.  No halo, no wings, no face.  Just golden light.  Mary’s face is flooded with the reflected radiance, her eyes are wide with concentration, and she appears to be listening intently with her head forward.  In stark contrast with the bracing, flailing, defensive posture of Mary in so many of the other Annunciation paintings, here her hands are folded quietly on her knees.  Not in her lap, primly like an obedient and passive child.  But as she leans forward to look and listen; her hands are calmly folded and resting on her knees.   She appears intent, a bit perplexed yes, yet she is clearly pondering at the same time, just as Luke describes.   She is being engaged, not terrified, by the angelic being.\\nMary’s positioning and countenance in the Tanner painting reminded me of Denise Levertov’s poem, “Annunciation.”   The poem begins with oblique references to the images we know from so many of these Annunciation paintings, with their symbolism of lilies for purity and period settings.  But Levertov brings Mary back down to our human level, and we are invited to consider how God might encounter, might annuciate, to each of us.  How might we each move from “how can this be?” to “here I am, a servant of the Lord.”  Levertov writes:\\nCalled to a destiny more momentous than any in all of Time, she did not quail, only asked a simple, “How can this be?”  And gravely, courteously, took to heart the angel’s reply, perceiving instantly the astounding ministry she was offered.\\nAgain and again the Gospel writer Luke reminds us that God is working with unusual characters to bring about God’s realm on Earth. Lowly people like young girls and tax collectors, people who are sick or deformed, prostitutes and blind people, possessed people and foreigners and other outcasts.  Insignificant Mary embraces God’s call to be part of that work.  She doesn’t say, “oh I’m too young, too inexperienced, too busy.”  She willingly takes on the burden of being pregnant and stigmatized.\\nI don’t see Mary as a model of sexual purity that I must emulate, or motherly achievement that is the only proof of a woman’s worthiness.  Mary’s witness to me is that she will go on to be one of adult Jesus’ early and most faithful disciples; she remains with him at his death and is an active part of the early Christian community proclaiming his resurrection and ongoing presence.   As a young woman, Mary had the gumption to believe that God had chosen her for important work, and she had the courage to respond.  I suspect this story survived not so we emulate her virginity or even her motherhood; we are to follow her model of discipleship.  Faithful discipleship as a follower of adult Jesus; this is Mary’s witness.\\nGod has daily ministries of bravery and hope for each of each of us and for the life of this congregation.   “How can this be?” we might find wonder.  It is because God seeks to use each of us, and we yearn to partner with God in this work.   So we listen and we ponder carefully.  We lean forward into them, as God’s annunciations come, keeping a steady gaze and calm hands.  Our consent will illumine us.  And we will shine as God’s lights in the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'We don’t know the actual context in which Jesus taught his followers the Lord’s Prayer.  They may well have been in the middle of eating together.  Perhaps a relaxed evening meal or a hastily consumed mid-day snack as they walked from one town to the next.   Give us this day our daily bread.  What kind of “bread” do you picture in your mind’s eye as you hear this petition?  When I pray this part of the Lord’s Prayer, I remember the squishy white sliced marvel of my childhood: Wonder Bread!  My sister and I loved to tear off the crust and mush it into a ball, which we would slowly nibble as we wandered the neighborhood.  A far cry from the flat pita-like bread that Jesus ate in his day.  Give us this day our daily bread: it seems so obvious, but what are we doing when we pray this part of the prayer? \\n\\nThe whole issue of daily sustenance, and our relationship with food, has become increasingly complicated. Food is so over-consumed in our part of the world that we live in culture of fad diets, rising obesity, various eating disorders and diet-related diabetes.  And some popular diets suggest that bread is fattening and bad for us.   Perhaps we should pray “keep us away from our daily bread!”   But we know all too well that as many of us walk miles to burn off calories from bread, others around the world walk miles to just find bread and food calories for their families. \\n\\nWe pour through glossy food magazines, watch hours of TV celebrity chef shows of other people cooking.  We obsess about nutritional value and the sourcing of our food, but as a nation it is now a well documented fact that we are spending less and less time cooking.  Food policy researchers have noted that while the price of an increasing abundance of processed food has plummeted since WW II, the price of fresh fruits and vegetables has sky-rocketed.  Is it any wonder that those with limited food budgets eat too much processed food, fast food, junk food?  The powers and reach of agri-business, industrialized feedlots, and GMO’s continue to grow, and overwhelm our supermarket aisles, and their products are being increasingly marketed to under-developed countries.  All while we are painfully, if we can stand to pay attention, painfully aware of the exploding number of people in the world who are hungry.  Over 800 million a day, with about 35,000 dying daily from hunger related illnesses.  Give us this day our daily bread.  How does God envision that we relate to our need for daily sustenance with the needs of others?\\n\\nAs we considered the first part of this prayer in the last few weeks, I suggested we imagine “God the Father” as the Divine Head of the World Household ((John Dominic Crossan’s phrase, from The Greatest Prayer: Rediscovering the Revolutionary Message of the Lord’s Prayer).  As a just and merciful gender-inclusive Householder, head a multigenerational estate.  God looking after God’s whole house, seeing that everyone, even the most vulnerable, get enough.  May your kingdom, your reign of peace and justice, come.  We considered how we are called to be co-workers, partners in helping heal the broken House of God’s world.  Today’s brief petition about daily bread moves us into the nitty-gritty of how life should go in God’s House of the World.  And it is not just about me as an individual:  not, give me my daily bread.  Maybe this is the first piece Jesus wants us to understand:  that we see ourselves in this need for sustenance together. As in the paraphrase of the prayer by John Philip Newell: “May there be food for the human family today and for the whole earth community.”  If you don’t have food, this should be a problem for me.   \\n\\nBut it is a huge challenge to maintain this awareness on a daily basis, to bring it to the consciousness of our children, to find ways to be around and work with and for hungry people.  I’m beginning to think this is one of the most challenging spiritual practices there is today:  what might I do daily that addresses world hunger, near and far?  Might I pray about this a few times a day?  Pick a country with food shortages and read about it, make a donation on a website, talk with my family about it? Find a food policy issue that worries me and pepper my congress people with letters about it?  Help my children to choose 3 items for the local food pantry each time we shop together and deliver it?  Really put a few more moments of attention to slow and careful table blessings said together at each meal? Grow some food – anything; cook some food mindfully?  What would a daily spiritual practice of engaging our daily bread look like for each of us?\\n\\n\\tJesus’ disciples would have heard this part of the prayer as they chaffed against the control of the Roman Empire, where the life for many within the Jewish community was precarious at best. People were conscripted for military duty, lost their land and were dealt taxes and tariffs on most aspects of their lives.  This also included the local fishing industry, which was of particular concern to many of those meeting Jesus.  Rome made commercial dealings more profitable for those in power, but far less so for everyone else, like the local fishermen.  The fish you caught were taxed, as was your boat and your nets, and the materials used to repair your nets and vessel (see John Dominic Crossan). \\n\\n\\tSo, the context for Jesus’ prayer is a tinderbox.  But what is so incendiary about: “Give us this day our daily bread?”  These words would resonate with the Exodus story for his Jewish followers: Their ancestors had fled slavery in Egypt, and struggled with starvation during their years of traveling through the wilderness on the way to the Promised Land.  But they were blessed with the appearance of manna, a substance that would last for about a day before spoiling, with which they could make bread.  Enough was provided just for that day.  Jesus’ prayer would seem to make a tidy circle, reminding them to trust God.  Just pray for this day….don’t get greedy.  Simple enough.\\n\\t\\n\\tNot so simple and innocent, writes the New Testament scholar, John Dominic Crossan.  He contends that this part of the prayer about daily bread may be the most dangerous part of Jesus teaching.  “Jesus dies not for demanding charity or generosity of hospitality,” says Crossan.  “(Jesus will be killed) because he insists the world and its food belong to God and not Rome.”   Over and over, Jesus would use both bread and fish to illustrate this reality: He would multiplying not just wine, but loaves and fishes, politically dangerous acts where the Romans are standing by ready to tax all of any extra food production!   Jesus spoke of himself as “the bread of life,” blessed and broke bread as symbolic of his own body and spirit that will nourish his followers. The resurrected Jesus stood on the beach directing his followers where to productively fish, then grilled them fish for breakfast.  In front of everyone, Jesus kept enacting a living parable of God as Householder of the world.  The Emperor of Rome is not ultimately in charge here; God is. \\t\\n\\n\\tI wander the aisle of the supermarket and wonder to myself: what does it mean that God is in charge of all this plenty?  What do I need, what is enough?   I was eating blueberries one recent summer while serving in another church in northern VA.   I was proud that I had not eaten blueberries flow in from Chile during the winter.  I had waited for seasonal fruit to arrive.  ”New Jersey blueberries” I read on the plastic box.  Pretty close-by to where I was living, but I wonder what it’s like to pick these things?  My few minutes on the Internet revealed that there were ongoing labor violations in the NJ blueberry industry. Haitian migrant workers come up from FL, enduring overcrowded and unsanitary labor camps, unsafe bus transportation.  The Farmworkers Ministry of the Catholic Diocese of Camden had recently been established, to provide a social justice ministry of outreach and advocacy among these farmworkers.  Not in my backyard?  Well, I’m eating the blueberries they pick, wasn’t I?  \\n\\n\\t God the Householder of the World wants food security, enough bread and fish, for everyone. If your child is starving, you become insecure, angry and desperate.   Might we learn more about the places of food insecurity in our Twin Cities?  What are the choices facing these families?  Paying for medicine or utilities or paying for bread.  As hard as it is for us to imagine, many of these people are already working several jobs. \\t\\n\\n\\tMaybe it’s our own anxiety about our own future that complicates our relationship with food.  God is ready to partner with us, to guide and empower us and our choices, and we stay stand-of-ish.  We stay muddled in our own worries and insistence that we figure this out ourselves.  Perhaps we might try a new rhythm this week.  Perhaps some more mindful tasting, savoring the things we eat each day, and giving thanks.  And as part of this rhythm, then learning more about where it comes from, the environmental impacts of our food production, who is hungry and why.  \\n\\n\\tYes, this church has a long history of collecting food and food money for those in need.  Meals on Wheels, sandwich making and food serving for those without food and shelter, financial support of our denominations hunger programs.  We have started providing weekend food for kids in need at our elementary school down the block.  But God and the whole food reality is much bigger than this.  What could be the new spiritual practices we will engage around our own food consumption and the wider questions of food justice?  As individuals, as families, as a church community?  Begin by praying like this, said Jesus:  “May there be food for the human family today and for the whole earth community….give us this day our daily bread.”  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " \"Every year, I receive a cheery Thanksgiving card from my auto insurance company.  This year, on the front of the card, there was a painting of a young family pouring out of a van and into the welcoming arms of an elderly couple.  A happy and poignant reunion scene under a tree ablaze in fall colors.  Inside the card were these words: “Coming Home: The sheltering arms of a golden maple, lasting stone walls, a family going home for the holidays – enduring images of a safe and secure time and place.”\\n\\t\\n\\tIt’s a scarey and unpredictable world out there, we are constantly reminded in the news media.  This longing for a place of certainty and safety runs deep, and seems to heighten in the darkening seasons of fall and winter.  Where do we each find our sense of safety and security?\\n\\nWhile my insurance company is bringing me homey annual Thanksgiving greetings, the church calendar does an odd thing.  As our cycle of scripture readings conclude at the end of each November, every year at this time we are pulled back to the tense days of Jesus’ arrest and execution.  Certainly a jarring departure from visions of homey safety and security!  Our cycle of weekly Bible readings come from the Revised Common Lectionary that we share with Christian churches around the world.  And they often provide an unsettling counterpoint to the current mood around us:  Here we are happily singing Thanksgiving hymns, contemplating or longing for in-gatherings of loved ones. And liturgically, aren’t we are just about ready to start the familiar and sweet baby stories about Jesus’ joyful birth?  But the last week of the annual church calendar, right before Advent, always hauls us back to the foreboding texts of Jesus crucifixion.  Today, these are accompanied with strong words of the Hebrew prophet Jeremiah, railing against the corrupt leaders of his 6th century BCE Jewish world.  Again, that cognitive dissonance when we approach the scripture; perhaps accompanied with some understandable resistance on our parts.  \\n\\nMy mind is tracking December plans for our congregation and a flurry of emails between my family members about our upcoming Thanksgiving feast.  Hot Italian sausage in the cornbread stuffing?  Jalepeno peppers or ginger in my cranberry sauce this year?  Ah….nothing says “all is right with the world” like hot turkey stuffing with tangy cranberry!  But here we are with Biblical texts that challenge us to wonder what we really do believe about safety and security in the world, the Kingdom/Realm of God and the ultimate role of Jesus Christ in our lives today.  \\n\\t\\n\\tOkay, so it’s the Catholics fault today has gotten complicated.  It was Pope Pius in 1925 who initially put out the call to identify the last Sunday in the liturgical year as  “Christ the King Sunday.”  Actually an oddly prescient decision, I would say, during the wild mix of hopefulness and real bleakness in the 1920’s.   Nations watched the rise of new repressive dictators rising in Europe over the shambles of the war that was to end all wars.  Not a bad idea to invite the church universal to consider some of the wider questions of “who is in charge, in this chaotic world?”  Since that time, traditional Protestant hymns for this day would include triumphal images of Jesus’ victory over the grave and reigning with God on high….hymns which can make a more progressive congregation cringe.  We don’t fancy talking about kings much here in America; we had a revolution in part so we wouldn’t have to endure a monarchy in which we were not represented.   And all that triumphalism that makes Christ the King that makes Christianity sound the like only viable or true religion on earth.  With our respect for other wisdom traditions and interfaith dialogue, such exclusivity about Christian claims just isn’t us at Emmaus. \\n\\t\\n\\tYet at the same time, today’s texts challenge us to take a hard look at the very powers that rule among us that today “destroying and scattering,” in Jeremiah’s words.  “Driving away” and hurting the very community that they are charged to support and protect.  The prophet voices God’s concern and dismay as the people of Israel struggle after returning from exile in Babylon:  a series of Jewish kings have become corrupt, having sold out to the interests of the wealthy and powerful, they no longer maintain the well-being of the people.  As Richard Nysse, professor of Old Testament, comments on this passage:  “Hurt caused by poor (human) leadership is a problem for God.”  The text “doesn’t assert specific leadership principles”  - it simply “announces the attention of God and the events that ensue from that attention.”  Or, I would put it a bit more crashly:  it’s as though God finally says, “damn-it, all of you, Enough!  I’ll do it!  I’m going to gather the remnant, bring them back into the fold, help them be fruitful and multiply, and raise up one in the future who will reign wisely and will rule with justice and righteousness.”  \\n\\t\\n\\tIs it any wonder that, after meeting Jesus and choosing to follow the Jesus Way, first century Christians looked back at this ancient text and said to themselves:  yes, Jesus is the one that God was talking about.  But what kind of reign, what kind of ruler do we see in Jesus of Nazareth?\\n\\n\\tOur New Testament text asks us to take another hard look at Jesus on the cross, to see again the taunting sign above his head, “King of the Jews.”  We are challenged to consider: what kind of king is this one who will be called the Messiah in Hebrew, the Christ in Greek?  Compare his “kingship” or authority to imperial rule of his day, and you get a very counter-intuitive image:  a crucified king. As the UCC theologian and minister Tony Robinson comments on this passage, whoever Jesus is for us, the New Testament claims that “This King is one who doesn’t rule, but stands with; doesn’t assert but surrenders; is not in the self-interest business.”   Robinson continues more sternly: We are speaking of a rule unlike the rule of “The extremely and obscenely wealthy” in our nation who take millions a year in salary while eliminating laborers’ pensions, one of many actions that contribute to dysfunction and despair in our society, undermining America's middle class and its relative security. Note well,” concludes Robinson, “safety and security are not the result of more security measures or security police or security technology. They are the result of a healthy community characterized by justice and righteousness.”  (Robinson, November 2013 blog).\\nThis question of “who is really in charge,” of our lives, is difficult to answer. I find this an especially perplexing and poignant issue right before Thanksgiving.  We pride ourselves on our self-sufficiency but also want to celebrate God’s good gifts of abundance. “Ah, all is right with my self-sufficient world. God’s gracious hand is truly upon us.” But if we are paying attention, we are faced with a wider world of great disparity, scarcity of food, shelter, potable water and secure livelihoods, amidst the abundance.  \\n\\nInteresting to note that in the Jeremiah reading, what God does first in response to poor leadership is to  “pay attention.”  The neglectful shepherds, human leaders, stopped attending to the people in need.  “I will attend to them,” says God.   We participate in God’s reign as we attend, pay attention, to those in need, even as the stories fade to the back pages of our newspapers, newsfeeds and blogs.  Careful attending leads to new actions.  I wonder if this might be a way into experiencing the Biblical proclamation of God’s reign on earth.  How can we pay attention and not turn away from all that is destroyed and scattered, unattended to?  How can I realistically believe that God’s reign of loving mercy, that I see in the life of Jesus, is really operative in our world?  \\n\\nSometimes, I can’t intellectually believe it, I can only practice at it.  Some days, after I have pondered enough national and world news to overwhelm me, I walk over to the huge map of the world that covers a whole wall in our townhouse living room.  This is my contemplative prayer practice where I wonder about the mystery of God’s reign of justice and righteousness, hope and mercy and how I might be a larger part of that tending and healing.  I wonder about how our home of ultimate safety and security is in God.  Not protection, certainly, but accompaniment.  Staring at the map, I look for a few hot spots on the planet:  this week the typhoon devasted Phillipines and the eastern end of the Mediterranean where enmity and fear and hatred continue to boil.  On another day, tornado destruction in Illinois, rise in poverty, obesity and diabetes in Mississippi.  I place my two hands on two different places and lean my head into the map.  I let my prayerful attending imagine God’s restorative attention.  How might we each more imaginatively attend to the world, and God’s reign among us, this week?  \\nThese scripture texts stretch my imagination, just as I want to focus inward on hearth and physical home.  They remind me that the forces of destruction and scattering are not the last word.  They call me to action by first to calling me to attending, paying attention.  And so we give thanks for these provocative texts, and for this time to worship and reflect together.  We give thanks for God’s attention of us and attending to us.  Amen.  \\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\tWell.  According to the Post story, only about 2% or Americans actually describe themselves as atheists.  Encountering a self-described atheist in American’s heartland is apparently so unusual that Glenn Beck claimed the CNN interview must have been some kind of fake.   The author of the Post story, Alexandra Petri, noted that thanking the Lord for such events is a natural assumption for around 80% of Americans, and that we presume everyone thinks the same way.  “Hold on a minute,” I remember thinking to myself.  I would not place myself among the 2% of atheists, but maybe we have something in common here!  I don’t believe that God saves certain people from tornadoes or floods and does not save others.  For me, this is not God’s job description: specifically guiding a split-second decision that allows for safety for some, and letting others be crushed by crumbling walls, killed by flying debris or drowning.   Yet, I still would claim that God is in the middle of all of it.  \\n\\n\\tI imagine we have a variety of perspectives in this congregation on just what God is up to in the course of natural disasters, and in this world of ours in general.  Has God created our world but now left its workings to us? If God is, as I just suggested, in the middle of all these things…..what is God doing?  As Anthony Robinson, UCC minister and author, asks in his book What’s Theology Got to Do with It: Convictions, Vitality and the Church:  “Is God simply a concept to be discussed?  …Is our life a seminar about God, rather than a relationship to be confessed or a community where God’s transformative presence is changing lives?” (p. 68-69).  Last week we heard again the wild story of Pentecost, where Jesus’ disciples were suddenly filled with the power of the Holy Spirit sent by God.  After Pentecost, these men and women start to courageously speak out about being filled with the Holy Spirit and a profound sense of new life. Courageously they step forward, testifying about their personal, life-changing experiences of God, Jesus and the indwelling of God’s renewing power.   Did the God of the first century act differently than the God of the 21st?  Are there only two options now: there is no God who interacts with us or God is in control of everything?  From dramatic natural disaster rescues to helping us find parking places?   Neither of these seem like good options to me.\\n\\n\\tTraditionally, the Sunday following Pentecost is designated as Trinity Sunday.  It’s a time when the worldwide church reflects on and celebrates the reality that God interacts with and is known to us in many ways.  Anthony Robinson would say that the age-old doctrine of the Trinity is the place to wrestle with these questions about how God relates to us and the rest of the world.  He claims that this “three persons of God in one” idea guards against our turning God into some kind of personalized comfort zone.   The Trinity “holds different truths in tension” (p. 64) and keeps pushing us to consider how we might know and experience God in different ways and different forms.  \\n\\n\\t It took the official Christian church about 300 years to formulate this symbolic language about both the Person and the actions of God, and it was stimulated by considerable controversy about Jesus himself.  Who was he?  Divine in some way, a divine creature in human disguise, or all human?  Who is Jesus now as God’s anointed one, the Risen Messiah, the Risen Christ, in our midst? This ancient Trinitarian wording, “Father, Son and Holy Ghost” became the shorthand metaphorical language used to talk about God-in-the-world.  This wording is still used in Christian baptism, and also in the rite of confirmation when young people affirm the baptismal vows made on their behalf when they were infants. Through the centuries there have been numerous controversies, heresies have been declared and denounced, and blood has been spilled over the doctrine of the Trinity.  In the early 17 and 18th centuries, debate over the Trinity, particularly the nature of Jesus, divided many of our United Church of Christ forbearers in New England Congregational churches.\\n\\n\\tOne of our United Church of Christ treasures is church historian and author, Barbara Brown Zigmund.  She explains that this metaphor of God as creator, redeemer and sustainer describes God as “one God existing in community.”  The Trinity speaks of how “God embodies the very nature of reality as relational and communal” (Barbara Brown Zigmund, Christian Century, 4/15/87).  I hear that same relational and communal aspect of God in today’s reading from Book of Proverbs:  Wisdom, a feminine noun in the original Hebrew, was there with God at the beginning of time.  Wisdom, as the divine feminine aspect of God?  Partner with God?  There may be more “we-ness” to God than we think.  “Let us create humans in our image,” God speaks in Genesis, “male and female let us create them.”  BBZ’s point is that we can both understand God better, and who we are as human beings, when we recognize “the relational nature of God.”  Another way of saying this is “we are all connected…and God is a part of that precious connectedness.”  \\n\\n\\tThings get even livelier in my mind when I think of both a masculine and feminine aspect within the Trinity itself.  Might this Lady Wisdom be an inter-connecting, animating force between these different aspects of God?  The idea of God existing as a 3-in-1 relationship suggests to me a dynamic, fertile and even dare-I-say juiciness within Godself.  Does this sound too racy?  I think it makes God infinitely more interesting, and relatable to me as a living human.  BBZ suggests that “to believe in a triune God is to suggest that there is an inner relationship within Godself which spills over into the Christian life.” I love this image. “There is an inner relationship within God’s self which spills over into” our lives.  We don’t have to constantly rev ourselves up, produce all this life giving, inspiring, relational energy on our own.  It’s already spilling over onto us from the 3-in-1 God!  As I watched images of thousands of volunteers pouring into the storm devastated regions of Texas, I could see that life-giving, relational energy pouring out.  God’s self of compassion spilling out over and through people digging through muddy debris, making meals, distributing supplies, comforting strangers.\\n\\nOne 8th century theologian, John of Damascus, put it this way:  “there is an exchange of energy between the persons of the Trinity by virtue of their eternal love.”  The Persons of the Holy Trinity metaphorically hanging around loving each other, grooving on each other.  All this interconnectedness and intimacy and affection overflowing onto/into us!   Hold that image in your minds eye the next time you look at one of your children, your grandchildren.  Relational overflow!  The next time you stare up into a tree or at the stars: picture the vibrating connections of this loving universal force, crackling back and forth.  The next time you look at your face in a mirror: imagine not just energy, but the affection of God-in-three-persons spilling out of your eyes.   Proverbs describes God and Wisdom constantly “rejoicing in God’s inhabited world and delighting in the human race.”  And because this delight overflows onto us, we too can be creative and wise, just like God our Father/Mother who is the wise creator. We too can be helpers and peaceworkers in this world, just like God in Jesus our brother.  We too can inspire and provide companionship to others, just like God in the Holy Spirit, which has been sent to us.\\n\\t\\n\\tSo when I think of the Trinity these days, I don’t see some dusty, outdated and irrelevant church doctrine.  I get an image of powerful, even wild and unpredictable, love energy snapping between the synapses of God.  Sizzling, vibrating connections between God the Father/Mother our Creator, God the Son, our Brother, God the Spirit.  God existing as this overflowing, loving community. And all of us coming together as the faith community so we can experience this spilling out of God more intimately.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tJesus arrives in Capernaum, a town near the Sea of Galilee.  A military officer sends word to Jesus that his slave is sick.  Please, will Jesus heal him?  Now the chorus of other characters chimes in to support the centurion’s plea. First the local religious leaders, who seem to fall all over themselves, praising this wealthy gentile. He has contributed to their synagogue building campaign and acts lovingly towards the Jewish people in his community.  Are the leaders more interested in fawning over this military officer or do they also have the slave’s physical health in mind?  The text is quiet on this point.   But like religious leaders throughout time, they were constantly parsing the question:  How far does God’s grace and mercy extend?  How open can we be to those who seem to have little value or have little to give in society, in our house of worship?  We don’t want to be seen as the “loser synagogue,” or the “gay church,” do we?   We are always happy to welcome a young family with 2.5 children, husband and wife who look like they can support our budget.  We may feel less welcoming of someone who appears to be living on the streets.  What will it look if we welcome and associate with these people?  \\n\\n\\tIt’s always this way, isn’t it?  For these first century religious leaders, the pull would be between the Jewish Law’s requirement to welcome and help the foreigner, the stranger in their midst…..and the fact that all sorts of people were deemed unhealthy for their community.  They were to avoid those who worshiped idols, people who were disfigured with illness or deformity, and people who were poor.  The great sea of those deemed “unclean” would taint the community’s righteousness (being adherent to the rule of Law) and very well-being as a collective.  \\n\\t\\n\\tPerhaps we can relate.  For us it is an ever-fluctuating mix of people-not-like-us.  The list probably varies among us, but usually represents people in whose presence we feel most insecure, most wary and afraid. The Other who represents an unknown that covers the gamut of foreignness: strange cultures and mysterious or mis-represented religions, other skin colors, people of other sexual orientations than our own, people with dementia or mental illness, people with gender identities that are other than stated on their birth certificate.  All perceived as the Other that we would rather avoid.\\n\\n\\tWhat is curious about this story is that the Roman centurion himself represents the Other: not just an “unclean Gentile,” but also the ruling group who will eventually torture and kill Jesus: the Roman Empire.  Yet as always, our tendency to separate people out into binary categories of black and white, good and bad, is challenged by the Biblical narrative.  In our current political climate, we are being urged to do this kind of moral separating, which is essentially contrary to Biblical principles.   What are there cultural assumptions and distinctions that need challenging among us?  Categories of good and bad, boundaries of who is included and excluded that we need to face as followers of Jesus?  Cultural assumptions that no longer serve, be they about race or religion or sexual orientation or gender identity?\\n\\n\\tThis Roman military man was a non-Jew known as a God-fearer. He and other Gentiles like him were drawn to Judaism’s moral precepts and worship on one God.  They would attend temple services and follow Jewish law….everything except the distinctive marking of circumcision for men. I doubt the centurion’s support of the Jewish community played well in the barracks with his men, nor did it help his reputation with his military superiors.  The centurion is part of Herod Antipas’ militia; part of the army that keeps the Jewish community under the repressive control of the occupying Roman Empire.   But this particular officer appears to have an unusual relationship with the community under his jurisdiction.  And Jesus will say that this man shows us what living faith is really like.  \\n\\n\\tA servant in the centurion’s household is very sick and the centurion is convinced that Jesus will be able to heal him.  The centurion has become the slave’s ally, and now he seeks to draw Jesus in as an ally of this marginalized human.  But instead of coming to Jesus directly, the centurion makes his appeal through intermediaries in the community.  Certainly, the centurion could have simply commanded Jesus presence.  But the centurion knows and respects the customs of the Jewish tradition:  mixing of Jews and Gentiles, in a private home, would render the honored teacher Jesus ritually unclean.   This centurion is apparently well-known by the Jewish elders in the community.  “He is worthy of you doing this,” the leaders assure Jesus, “….he loves our people.”  There is a web of connection that has reached across boundaries and been built over time.  Cultural assumptions and fears have begun to evaporate.\\n\\n\\tJesus is intrigued and starts heading for the centurion’s home.  But before he can arrive to heal the slave, another group approaches, this time the centurion’s friends.  Fellow soldiers?  Neighbors?   Clearly this man has developed deep relationships in this community.  And apparently the centurion has had second thoughts.  His friends tell Jesus that the man is overwhelmed by his own sense of unworthiness.  But the centurion’s reaction is also coupled with a peer-to-peer acknowledgement with Jesus of their mutual power and authority.  The centurion’s realm of authority is over the men in his command.  This is not a person who is used to asking for help.  He tells people what to do.  But he has chosen to use his own authority to be an ally for a marginalized and helpless person, his slave.  And, the centurion humbly recognizes Jesus’ realm of authority is over a different and far larger sphere.  “But speak only the word and let my servant be healed.” And Jesus heals the servant, a nobody slave who has been found to be of value by a whole community.  “Jew and Gentile, slave and free, all are one in Christ Jesus our Lord,” the apostle Paul would later write (Galatians 3:28).\\n\\tThe centurion acknowledges the privilege of his authoritative resources, and also is humble about God’s greater power through Jesus.  This is the shape of faith that catches Jesus’ attention and we need to follow suit.   In the United Church of Christ, we are part of this brave centurion’s legacy.  From the fight against slavery, to early support of women in leadership, to the ongoing work for civil rights for people of color and for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, our denomination has served as an ally to the marginalized.  One person, a Roman centurion with authority and wealth, steps forward as an ally.  He connects with Jesus, he humbly partners with Jesus, for the well being of someone one on the margins.   This is the shape of faith, these are its contours, says Jesus.  Let’s have some more conversation about how we, like the centurion, might become better allies to those on the margins.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'JOHN TELLS ABOUT JESUS\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tThroughout the weeks before Christmas, I shared a series of “first person” sermons.  Each Sunday I “took on” the persona of three different New Testament author: Mark, Matthew and Luke.  I was able to ham-it-up a bit as I pretended to be a 1st century disciple, speaking to you, 21st century followers of Jesus.  We considered each of the authors’ different historical settings and audiences for their writings, as they sought to tell the story of Jesus’ life and purpose from their perspectives. In relating how Mark, Matthew and Luke each described the birth or public arrival of Jesus, we explored how each of them give somewhat contrasting views on the life and person of Jesus.  Different ideas about how and in what ways Jesus becomes, in the words of the early church, God incarnate, God-with-Us, Immanuel, in human flesh.  \\n\\t\\tToday we come to the gospel of John….and somehow, I just couldn’t seem to deliver this sermon as John in “first person”   Maybe it’s that his Gospel is so very different from the other three gospels, and I have always found his words and his worldview a bit perplexing and even unsettling.   Yes, there can be something erudite, rambling, off-putting about John’s gospel.  I almost have to hold it at arm’s length.\\nBut it’s worth exploring, in part because it contains the strangest birth story about Jesus yet.  In hearing how John introduces Jesus, we might wonder: What happened to our familiar Christmas birth narrative?  Where are Luke’s  angels and shepherds heralding the baby Jesus’ birth, the focus on Mary?  Where are Matthew’s tender Joseph, the Three Magi  visiting the baby and King Herod trying to kill the baby?   Weirdly, none of this appears in John’s Gospel.  \\nEach Gospel writer begins by is trying to describe WHEN the Incarnation happened.  For Mark it happened when the adult Jesus stepped forward to be baptized and God adopted him as his anointed child.  For Matthew and Luke, it happened when Mary miraculously conceived and gave birth to Jesus; God gets intertwined with humans through paternity.  For John, the Incarnation happened way before any of that, before God’s creation of the universe!  Different perspectives, lots to chose from!\\n\\t\\tAs time went by, and each of the four gospels were written, the circle of new Christians spread wider and wider into non-Jewish communities.  With John writing in the early 2nd century CE, we now have an author who was very Greek and used the language and symbolic world of the Greeks who had mixed with the middle eastern world.  He uses un-Hebrew-like words and concepts like “logos” meaning “logic,” (abstract word used by the early Stoic philosophers) “light and darkness,” and “life.”  The Jesus we know through John is repeatedly speaking of his coming so people could find life and find life abundantly!\\n\\t\\tInstead of short, pithy moral teachings, John’s gospel is filled with long philosophical discources, that most likely are not Jesus’ words verbatim.  Again, its important to these four gospel books are theological documents, not historical biographies about Jesus.  Everything in the gospels is seen through the lens of the community empowered, in the present, by the Risen Christ.  And we see this no where more clearly than in John.  For starters, John does not mention a Baby when he presents Jesus to his readers.  With strange poetic language, the author introduces Jesus, God Incarnate, by going both prehistoric and cosmic at the same time.   Let’s look closer at the scripture reading on the back of the bulletin:  Notice how the words repeat themselves, in a tumbling litany:\\nIn the beginning   In the beginning  - echos of a time before time, eternal time?  The Cosmic Word appears with a capital W.  Eternal, cosmic Word of God, there from the beginning.  Speaking, calling out, creating, making it so.\\nMore repetition…..     WordWordWord.\\nGodGodGod – the name God repeated eight times.  This story is not really about Jesus, the Gospel writer seems to be urging.  It’s about God!\\nBeingbeing.  LifeLife.   Creation keeps springing forth.\\nDarkness – one reference.  The image then vanishes into the swirl of repeating   brightness -  Light Light Light Light Light Light.\\nBecoming more specific now:  TestifyTestifyTestified – spoken words pouring forth - John the Baptizer has foretold it!\\nWorldWorldWorldWorld  - eternal Word with a capital W coming into the temporal world  - two realms colliding, inter-connecting.  \\nBelieve believe! - we are addressed, urgently invited.\\nFlesh Flesh,  - the author tries to clarify.    \\nOnly Son   Only Son\\nThen almost shouting, full of Grace and Truth!    \\nThis is Jesus, see him and see God, the writer seems to groan.  Hear him and hear God. Grace upon grace.\\nAnd finally, this tender whisper:  This is the one.  Close to the Father, close to the Creator’s heart.\\n\\t\\tWith this mishmash of abstract Biblical references and imagery, John leaves me overwhelmed, a bit breathless.  Frankly, his words shake me out of my post-holiday stupor of rich food and revelry.  But John’s Greek listeners would find nothing strange in this cosmic perspective, as “word” or “logos” means logic in Greek.  In the beginning was logos, logic, the mind of God and it was with God and the mind of God, the intelligence was God. The philosophical Greeks loved this stuff.  But…where is John going with this?  He also is connecting with his Jewish readers, as delight in the “Word” of God, in the teachings of the Torah, was sacred to all Jews.  The prophet Jeremiah’s image of finding God’s words and eating them, symbolically consuming them into one’s being because they are so precious, gives us a sense of how central “Word” was for these people.   \\n\\t    John chooses symbolic, poetic language to help people better understand “who is this Jesus?”  Who is this one we are ALREADY experiencing in the midst of our community as the Risen Christ?   Now most Greek Christians and bi-lingual Jewish Christians would be with John up to this point.  John describes Jesus as the agent of creation, as the source of “life,” as a light that shines in human darkness and evil.   But it is in verse 14 that John makes his bold move:  “And the Word became flesh and lived, dwelt among us.”  The Greek word for “dwelt” actually is derived from the word “tent.”  Can you hear the echoes of God of the Hebrew Exodus, who dwelt, tented with the Israelites in their wanderings in the desert wilderness, in the sacred tabernacle and also in the firey pillar that went before them?   \\n\\t\\tAnd this is where John’s words edge up on the “scandal” that Apostle Paul describes in his letters to the early churches.  High-minded Greeks, for whom bodies and the material world were an awkward mess, found this idea rather repugnant:  This logos, that has always been here, has now entered the world in a deeper, fuller way.  John’s words jump off the page at this point:  This one who has dwelt among you has now has become incarnated, put on human flesh!  God has become incarnate among you, sharing in your joys and pains here in earthly flesh.  And in receiving this one, you too have the “power to become children of God.”   Which makes us siblings, doesn’t it?  Brothers and sisters in Christ; an unlikely mix of folks all in one family of God.   Because we are human, are part of Creation, this Word, this Jesus, is all tangled up in us.  Revealed in us.  Working in us and the person sitting next to us and the person on the other side of the world we have never met.  Sound, mysterious, huge and confusing?  You bet.   \\nIt’s a stormy grey Sunday after the soft glow of Christmas.  The houselights have come up….. and “wham,” and here is the real deal: Christmas isn’t just about warm fuzzy feelings and presents and family gatherings.  For us in the community of believers and seekers we say that God is here with us in this newborn baby; God is for all of humankind.  The God who spoke and created creation, still speaks this creating power today.  In each of us and in all of this messy, chaotic and beautiful world.  And our job is to listen to and respond to the Living Word that has moved into and is present in all of it.   “How it all works” is revealed to us as we keep our eye on Jesus the Christ. May the poetic mystery and challenge of John’s Gospel continue to challenge and transform us.  Amen.\\n\\n(followed by time for silent reflection)\\n\\n\\t\\t ',\n",
       " 'BLESSED COMMUNITY\\n\\n\\tIt has been a cold snowy January!  It’s been snowing even more up in Minnesota, where my husband Chris and I have our home way up on the north shore of Lake Superior.  And it’s been really cold and the wind has been blowing hard which makes it colder.  Now Minnesotans know how to deal with snow, but the governor canceled school again last week because the snow was SO HIGH and the wind made the tempertures SO LOW.  Lots of church services and programs go cancelled too. So I was interested to read this blog from a Lutheran minister I know, David Lose, who was stuck at home; couldn’t get to church to hold meetings or study groups, or to the hospital or homes to visit people from his church. But his phone was still working and he spent much of the suddenly empty day calling various members of his congregation.  After helloes and a bit of casual conversation, he asked a number of different people the same question:  “What’s God been up to in your life lately?”  Now at first, most of his people simply went silent.  How would you answer that question this morning: “What’s God been up to in your life lately?”   The minister sat for a moment with what he called this “Holy Silence” on the other end of the line, and then said: “Well, what’s been keeping you awake at night?”  And one by one, the stories poured out.   This seemed to be an easier question!\\n\\tIt’s difficult, isn’t it, to talk about what God is up to in our lives.   Some people say, God is doing something in your life if you are blessed with being healthy or plenty of money or feeling happy or saved from some disaster.  But what about the times that are hard for us, when someone sick, not enough money, feel sad or someone in an accident.  Is God not blessing us?   Some people say God is punishing you if bad things happen.  I don’t think that is true.  When things happen in our lives, good or bad, is it humans that make them happen or is it God or is it both?  Hard questions!  \\n\\tLet’s look at Jesus’ teaching again:  he says some strange things:  Blessed are the poor, those who mourn, the meek (not powerful), the hungry.  What?  All these things that we think are NOT blessings, curses even.  But look what he says: these are all places where God’s action happens.   Where there is room to let God in;  When I realize everything isn’t perfect in my life, I realize that I don’t just do life on my own. Something happens in us and we start opening up to receiving.  Receiving from God, from others.  Receiving?  If we are followers of Jesus aren’t we supposed to always be giving?\\n\\tPassage from Micah – do justice, love kindness, walk humbly with God.  Those are about doing, giving, generosity.  \\n\\tTeachings of Jesus – yes, do/give/be generous.  AND learn to receive.  This is hard for us sometimes.  We want to be in control.  We want to be the givers.  But the blessed community has both givers and receivers.  We all need to take turns being one, then the other.  Not good for one group to always give, one group to always receive.  \\n\\tIn worship we get to practice being receivers.  Receivers of God’s word, God’s love and forgiveness.  Receivers of Communion, the symbol of Jesus’ ongoing presence among us and the community this offers.  In this church there is a tradtion of taking communion, tearing off the bread and then dipping it in the jucie.  Today, I invite you to practice being receivers by letting a server break the bread off for you.  Practice receiving it.  And then watch this week.  How are we the blessed community going out into the world.  Can we be both givers and receivers?  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tAnyone who does laundry on a regular basis knows the agony of the lost sock.  You’re folding the dry shirts and sheets, deep in the endlessly repeating cycle of dirty clothes getting clean.  And there it is:  another darn sock without it’s match.  Actually, the lost sock is not really the problem.  What is now troublesome is this now “left-over” sock.  Leftover glove or mitten, a metal nut without a matching size bolt. There is a “forlorn lostness” to this solo item.  Funny how these small, everyday circumstances around our home can sometimes put us in touch with deep feelings and wonderings.  We might be reminded of other lost things and broken pairs in our life.  Like a friendship or a marriage, or a loved one who has died.  An adult child who seldom calls anymore, or an adult child who seems to have lost adulthood and struggles with finding a satisfying worklife, emotional stability.  We might think about the loss of a beloved church member who angrily departed or who drifted away and stopped coming to worship.  Lost socks: Memories get snagged and we suddenly find ourselves mulling over the realities that run below the surface of our everyday lives.  At times we ourselves may feel lost, or a part of ourselves seems to have gone missing.  Perhaps it was a lost opportunity, a sense of optimism, a certainty about our abilities.  Or that secure feeling that God really was there for us. \\nJesus of Nazareth had an uncanny ability to recognize and search out lostness; people lost to themselves, people lost to their communities.  He wanted people to know that lostness, and the grief that can accompany it, matters to God; God somehow knows and aches with all this human lostness, isolation, disconnection, separation, endings.  Maybe that’s why Jesus hung out with marginalized people who were lost to society, to their community and its supportive fellowship, lost to themselves.  And Jesus chose to do a radical and intimate thing:  he frequently shared meals with these lost people.  \\n The two parables we just heard from Luke are told by Jesus in reaction to the grumbling of some local religious leaders that Jesus’ actually sits down to eat with “lost” people.  Both tax collectors, specifically, and generalized sinners, people who broke Jewish law, were considered to be “lost” to society, sullied individuals who should be avoided.  These rules may seem foreign or even ridiculous to us, but Jesus was breaking what was known as the Jewish purity code by hanging out and eating with corrupt petty officials, people with deformities and illness, and sex workers.  In their defense, the Pharisees and scribes did have the unity and well-being of the whole community to consider.  The suspicious and repressive occupying Roman enforcers were always to close at hand.   Jesus overhears these Jewish legal scholars complaining and tells these two stories about lost-and-found.\\nThese are disarmingly simple stories about seemingly trivial items: one single sheep and one small coin.   “Which one of you would not leave your whole flock; what woman wouldn’t use up lamp oil to find one small coin?” Jesus asks the crowd.  “uh….that doesn’t sound wise,” I can hear people muttering to each other.  What kind of smart herder risks losing a whole flock to find one lamb?  The image is over-the-top; it doesn’t make sense.  Stranger yet, shepherd is an unlikely role model for God who searches for the lost.  In Biblical times, shepherds were considered shiftless and dishonest, dirty and ritually impure themselves. The next story is just as exaggerated.  A woman loses coin valued at about one days labor.  She uses up precious lamp oil and time to search her house.  She finds the coin and invites her friends to “rejoice” whereby they all start partying in celebration, using up more of her meager resources.  The Lord God of the universe is like a persistently searching shepherd, like a diligently searching woman?  This sounded odd to Jesus listeners.  Jesus implies that God not only searches for the lost, the misfits, but God wants to feast in an extravagant and seemingly wasteful manner and celebrate how all the lost people are welcomed in.  No wonder the religious leaders found Jesus irritating.\\nAccording to Jesus, God is out there searching, persistently looking, not waiting for those on the margins to be included.  Not waiting for us, in our own disoriented sense of “lostness,” to finally see that we could have a closer connection to the Creator of the Universe.  No, Jesus seemed to think God is actively pursuing us.    \\nWhat does it feel like to be subject to this kind of search?   Do you find it reassuring….. or does it creep you out to think of God searching for you?  We talk a lot in the liberal church about how we welcome all seekers, and how important our own individual search for God and truth and mystery is.   We want to make sure we have the freedom to seek out God on our own terms, without someone telling us where that search should go or what the discoveries might be.  Perhaps there is some hubris in this insistence?   We bring a strong sense of independence and carefully guarded skepticism to our search for God.  But if God is looking for me, it seems to take away my control of this process!  Will I be judged, even punished, once I am found?  Will God demand something really difficult or ridiculous of me?  \\nHere is where I find the matching of the Luke story today with this passage from Exodus to be unexpectedly revealing.   I caution us about a literal reading of this supposed interchange between God and Moses.  We can get distracted by focusing only on:  “just how did a conversation between a person and God get recorded?”  Think of this narrative as a parable, like stories Jesus taught.  It’s recounted as Jewish sacred history, its recorded so people can know what God is like.  And it’s a mind-bender!  This is a scene from the Israelites’ time in the wilderness, following the escape/Exodus from enslavement in Egypt.  They are pretty lost themselves at this point, uncertain where the promised land is and how to get there. They also seem to be losing a sense of their emerging identity as God’s people.  Their leader Moses keeps going up to the mountain to commune with God, and this time he hasn’t been back for days.  Aaron has been left and is valiantly trying to keep the peace among the lost, the worried and restless families.  They want something to follow, some symbol of this mysterious God who is supposed “will go before them and lead them.  Aaron suggests they take all their gold jewelry and melt it down to form a golden calf.   “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord” Aaron proclaims when they were done.  They all bring burnt offerings and celebrate in front of what they considered to be an image of the deity that has brought them up out of Egypt.  God gets whiff of what is happening down below and confronts Moses.   Whether they were actually worshiping other gods or simply ached for a symbolic representation of their one God and Lord, the text isn’t quite clear.  It was to be a “festival to the Lord.”  What is clear is that God is pictured as furious, going on a rant, pretty much disowning these people who seem to have lost their senses and their connection with God.  \\nMoses and God argue back and forth, almost like two parents trying to pass the blame for their disobedient child.  No, she’s your child!  No, she’s your daughter!  Well, whatever….I’m at my limit here with these people! says God.  But what happens next is that God changes God’s mind.  God actually repents, so the story goes.  God changes God’s perspective.  Yes, it does sound terribly anthropomorphic.   But I find this image compelling.  If God can change God’s perspective and repent, reorient, then….maybe you and I can too.  We are after all, made in God’s image, according to our Creation stories.  Maybe that’s the beginning of letting myself be found.  Stop, open myself to a new perspective, repent, reorient, be ready to receive.  It’s another over-the-top story, but the Hebrew writers wanted people to know that God is persuadable and extremely passionate when it comes to human beings.  \\n\\tThis is the God who searches us out in uncertain times in our lives, transition times as congregations and tumultuous times as a nation.  Watch this week.  How is God searching you out?  Watch for invitations to stretch your imagination, to welcome lost parts of yourself, to open yourself to those who seem different.  Maybe there will be a spontaneous invitation to rejoice and feast together with all kinds of unlikely characters.  Let’s keep our eyes and ears open.  Someone, infinitely mysterious and passionately close at hand, is searching for each of us.  Thanks be to God. Amen.',\n",
       " '\\t“Once to every man and nation.”  Once to every woman and nation, I would add.  In spite of its gender exclusive title, this hymn by James Russell Lowell never fails to stir and challenge me.  A 19th century poet, editor and diplomat, Lowell was the son of a Congregational minister.  Lowell was also an active abolitionist, working with his wife Maria White in the New England anti-slavery movement.  Our hymn is part of a longer poem called “The Present Crisis,” which Lowell published the poem in Boston in 1845, as a protest against US involvement in the war with Mexico. Lowell was convinced that land added to Texas would only increase the territory of permitted enslavement of certain humans. After a portion of the poem was set to music, it was often sung in many New England Congregational churches, which felt called to anti-slavery work. “Once to every man, woman and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side.”  These denominational ancestors of our United Church of Christ believed that the then prevailing “truth” of black people’s inherent inferiority to white people was a “falsehood.”  For them, “time (had truly) made ancient good uncouth.”  \\nThe tone of the hymn is somber, even gruesome at times: we walk a path “by light of burning martyrs,” tracking “Jesus’ bleeding feet.”  Yet, I experience an odd mixture of feeling both chastened and hopeful as I sing the words, challenged again and again by the phrase, “new occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.” \\nAs a nation, I believe we are at an interesting confluence of “new occasions” this last week.  MLK Jr birthday, a impeachment trial, today’s Winter Congregtional meeting…… I find myself wondering: “what new duties” are being revealed to us as disciples of Jesus? In a time when politics has sharply divided us as a nation, we so want the Jesus story to NOT be about politics.  \\n\\tBut the Gospel of Matthew wants his readers to know that Jesus’ public ministry begins in response to a political act:  Jesus learns that John, his cousin and most likely his spiritual mentor, has been arrested and jailed by the local political ruler King Herod.  Jesus leaves his hometown and heads to Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee.  And, “from that time” on, writes the Gospel of Matthew, “Jesus begins proclaiming ‘repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.’”  Jesus starts with a message about not about getting to heaven when you die, but about…..politics!  About governance, who is in charge and about how choices are made in this public realm.  He says that the kingdom that rules the heavens, the reign of God, has come near.  The first public words out his mouth are a radical political proclamation about the nature of our life together as a body, polis, community.  And these words will eventually pit him against the political powers of the day and get him arrested and jailed and crucified.   \\n\\tWe are on the edge of a communally fraught time for our nation.  New occasions that are challenging us with new duties, in the words of the Lowell hymn.  Last week began with our annual celebration The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. birthday, in an era when racial inequity around housing, jobs, rates of imprisonment and health care, and resulting racial tension, continue to soar.  Dr. King often used the Biblical phrase, “the beloved community.”  He spent his public life addressing the interwoven realities of racism, militarism and poverty, which he claimed conspired together to keep our nation from being such a beloved community.   Mid-week, we witnessed the beginning of the Senate impeachment trial, of our current President.  We continue to experience deep, angry and chaotic divisions in our country, in our leadership and general population.  As a church, we are slowly starting to emerge out of a time of hurtful divisions in our own congregation, but have a ways to go before we are a healthy and revitalized ministry-focused church.  This is the reality, the context, in which this Matthew passages drops today.\\nIn the midst of all this, we encounter Jesus the adult, who starts his public ministry by saying the reign of heaven is coming near.  And then he does this very odd thing of going up to a couple of fishermen and saying “follow me, I will make you fishers of people,” and the guys drop everything, I mean everything, and follow him.  Leaving nets and catch and boats and family?  Not a prudent move, it would appear.  One Biblical scholar (Warren Carter) has noted that Jesus appropriates the word kingdom, used by the Roman empire, and slyly strikes at the heart of mighty mperial Roman rule.  “Kingdom of God is at hand!”  Not, “the kingdom of Caesar.”  One might say that Jesus is referring to regime change.   God’s kingdom, reign of justice, mercy and peace, as opposed to the way that the ruling Roman’s operate, is happening here. The “beloved community” God intends is at hand, it draws near.  Jesus is going to start acting like his very presence, his teaching, his healing work, extends this regime change and reveals it.  And who does he invite to join him first?  Fishermen.  Not the local scholars or politicians, or soldiers, not the bakers, artisans or tax collectors.  All three gospels, Matthew, Luke and Mark, tell us his first students, followers, are fishermen.  Historians hold this is significant because the fishing industry of the time was more fully embedded in the imperial Roman economy that just about anything else.  (Warren Carter describes how) “Rome asserted control over the land and sea, their production, and the transportation and marketing of their yields with contracts and taxes.”  Boats, nets, your catch, where you pulled up your boat, who you sold to, prices, all regulated by the empire who also takes a huge cut.  Professor Carter continues: “Jesus disrupts these men’s lives, calls them to a different loyalty and way of life, creates a new community, and gives them a new mission (fish for people). His invitation to them exhibits God’s empire at work, this light shining in the darkness of Roman-ruled Galilee.”  Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.  Now we move to the relational, the building of this beloved community.  It’s going to be about how we live together, govern ourselves under God’s rule.\\n\\tThis same Biblical scholar (Warren Carter) notes that Jesus will go on and heal people who have actually been physically damaged by living in the inequities of the Roman imperial system.  Jesus comes and starts to “repair imperial damage.”  At least 70-90% of the inhabitants of the region were living in poverty.  Food insecurity, unclean drinking water, social stress, poor nutrition, frequent imprisonment and hard physical labor just to survive.  Many of the illnesses that Jesus will cure are caused by these kinds of unjust conditions: body weakness and paralisis, blindness, mental instability, fevers.  Jesus “enacts God’s life-giving empire.”   When I read this, all of a sudden the healing stories of Jesus seemed more radical, more seditious, than I ever imagined.  I also realized how closely these conditions of first century people’s lives parallels that of people of color in this nation today.\\nMartin Luther King, Jr. called our nation to repair “imperial damage” of centuries of racism, militarism and poverty.  And it was very hard for much of our nation to hear him.  And the damage continues.  Is the current US Senate trial, in a sense about “imperial damage” having been done to our nation?  What do we each want to say to our elected Senators about this?  Closer to home, some would say this congregation has sustained damage.  And there is considerable disagreement about how and why certain damage to people, relationships, structures and programs actually happened.   But how might we move beyond the narrative that this is a troubled, declining church and get on with wider ministries of “damage repair” in our wider community and world?  The conflict in the apostle Paul’s first century church in Corinth was due to an emphasis on individual freedom over the well-being of the whole congregation.   Will we seek to both honor our diversity of perspectives yet still be “united in the same mind and same purpose” as the apostle Paul urged the conflict-ridden church in ancient Corinth?   I think this is possible.  I think this is beginning to happen among us, as “new occasions” are bringing us new challenges and “new duties,” as a church.  “Speak and act so no one will doubt you are brothers and sisters in Christ,” Paul wrote to his friends in Corinth.   And may it be, increasingly so, for us.  Amen.\\n\\n()',\n",
       " '\\tOn this day that we celebrate the ministries of our Sunday School, I invite us to reflect on just how we pass on the Christian faith to the next generation.  Is it a matter of transfering certain information about history, ideas and morals? Certainly engaging our young people’s intellect is important, so they can make wise decisions about their own beliefs.  But if there is more to our experience of the Holy than thoughtful ideas, we also engage hearts, souls, even bodies in the exploration of faith.  How do we form the faith of the next generation?  \\n\\tWhen I was in Sunday School, many years ago, we were awarded little gold pins for memorization of Bible verses.  I still have mine tucked away in my jewelery box; a small open book with the words “Naval Amphibious Base Chapel, Coronado, CA” in tiny blue letters.  I think I memorized the Beatitudes, but I really can’t remember.  This is back when then prevalent Sunday School model might be described as the “banking theory” of Christian Education.  Just cram as many Bible stories and information into the blank slate of a child’s brain, in the hopes that they will be able to draw on this information later.  When confronted by an ethical dilemma or future decision as an adult, they can make a ready “withdrawal” out of this bank account where the church has made deposits.  \\n\\tBut what I remember more distinctly from my childhood is that the chapel altar had one of those twirling three-sided deals, especially created for the military at the time.   Turn it and there were Torah scrolls on one side for the Jews who worshipped on Friday evening.  Turn it again and there was the crucifix with Jesus on it for the Catholics who came at all different times and also got to use the curious closet confessions and the bowls of holy water.  The third side of this marvelous contraption held the plain cross for us low-church and minimally liturgical Protestants who only came on Sunday morning.  This gave everything a distinctively interfaith atmosphere, before I had a clue to what interfaith dialogue or relations might mean.  Today, there would be special prayer spaces nearby for Muslims and celebration rooms for Wiccans.  Interesting to me how the US military has made provision for this faith variety for years.   Seeded within me at a young age was an awareness of other faith traditions, ones that were somehow valued equally with mine.  Different did not mean better or worse.   “Different ways to connect with what we call God,” my mom would muse when I questioned her on the drive home.  Faith formation happened for me in Sunday School, but also in worship in the Chapel, in conversation with my parents on the drive home.  And it also happened with people I met, people who were outside my family circle.\\n\\tI will never forget our Protestant minister, Chaplain Menges.  Maybe its because he dressed in the same Naval officer’s uniform as my dad that he caught my attention.  But Chaplain Menges, a big beefy guy with booming voice, wore summer dress whites all year round with crosses on his shoulder boards.  My parents would later tell the story about how Chaplain Menges basically blew the chapel budget with his after worship Coffee Hour beverage choice.  Each Sunday, out in the hot southern California sun, the sailors on chapel duty would hand out ice cold soda pop; Chaplain Menges loved the stuff and wanted to share the abundant grace of this blessed nectar with us.  Happily guzzling as many bottles as we could before my mom caught up with us, my siblings and I thought we were in heaven.   Early on, my faith was being formed:  not so much by the deposit of facts in my brain, but seeded by images of and attitudes about diversity.  Fed even by sugary sodas that hinted at overflowing abundance in God’s house.   Nurtured by a Chaplain who remembered our names and wanted us to know God’s extravagant welcome.\\n\\tHow was the centurion’s faith formed in our story today?   We have no idea where he was originally from, or how he was raised.  But there is something here about faith formation of adults, which I think is important to notice on a day when we are celebrating children’s Sunday School programs.  This Roman military man was a non-Jew known as a God-fearer.  He and other Gentiles like him were drawn to Judaism’s moral precepts and worship on one God.  They would attend temple services and follow Jewish law….everything except the distinctive marking of circumcision for men.  Apparently, they even respected the tradition of Jews not co-mingling with non-Jews.  In the story, the centurion and Jesus communicate at a distance, through intermediaries, and Jesus never actually gets to the centurions home.   Hard to say how this Roman military man evolved or exactly what was his particular religious upbringing.   He would have been part of Herod Antipas’ militia; part of the army that kept the Jewish community under the repressive control of the occupying Roman Empire.   \\nBut this particular centurion appears to have an unusual relationship with the community under his jurisdiction.  \\n\\tA servant in the centurion’s household is very sick; and the centurion is convinced that Jesus will be able to heal him.  But instead of coming to Jesus directly, the centurion makes his appeal through different intermediaries in the community.  Why hold Jesus at arms length in this way?  Certainly, the centurion could have simply commanded Jesus presence.  But the centurion knows and respects the customs of the Jewish tradition:  mixing of Jews and Gentiles, in a private home, would render the honored teacher Jesus ritually unclean.   But this centurion is apparently well-known by the Jewish elders in the community, who come to Jesus with this suprising appeal:  the elders speak earnestly to Jesus, describes the Gospel writer Luke….”he is worthy of you doing this….he loves our people.”  There is connection here, relationships have been built over time.  “He built our house of study and worship, our synagogue.”  I have wondered what this action cost the centurion…both in money and in prestige among his military contingent.   Jesus is intrigued and starts heading for the centurion’s home.  But before he can arrive to heal the slave, another group approaches, this time the centurion’s friends.  Fellow soldiers?  Neighbors?   Clearly this man has developed deep relationships in this community.  Apparently the centurion has had second thoughts, is overwhelmed by his own sense of unworthiness.  But his reaction is also coupled with a peer-to-peer acknowledgement of power and authority.  His realm of authority is over the men in his command.  This is not a person who is used to asking for help.  He tells people what to do.  But he recognizes Jesus realm of authority is over a different and far vaster sphere.  “But speak only the word and let my servant be healed.”   And Jesus heals him, a nobody slave who has been found to be of value by a whole community.  Jew and Gentile, slave and free.\\n\\tWhat I know is that we don’t come to God alone.   We come and connect with this one we call God because community has brought us here.  Either in our distant past, or in this very day, people have nudged and encouraged us in the faith.  Centurions who love foreigners and build them a synagogue.  Teachers who love our children and sit with them and get to know them.  Teachers who love our youth and bring donuts and power point lessons about the life and teachings of Jesus, and their very selves to the conversation about God, and life and meaning and purpose.  \\n\\tThe town of Capernaum in the first century.  The church here at Emmaus in the 21st century.  Thanks be to God for these communities of faith formation.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'Church potlucks, a beloved tradition in a wide variety of congregations, have been the brunt of media jokes for years.   Saturday Night Live “Church Lady” parody; quips about typical Lutheran church cuisine on Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie Home Companion.  Because much of my ministry was spent in California, my potluck experiences are quite mixed.  I remember standing in one potluck line following an ordination service in a foody-sophisticated Marin County congregation just north of San Francisco.  I was joking with a colleague about the difference between San Fernando Valley farming communities church potlucks of jello-salad and bean-mushroom-soup-canned onion rings fame and this spread before us of fresh salmon, leafy salads and piles of artichokes and aioli dip.   Looking back, I realize I had not only disparaged certain regional food of the Valley, but that I had also made a somewhat classist comment.  Years later I moved to Minnesota and more humbly acquired new potluck vernacular as the mysteries of tater-tot hot dish, lefhsa and dessert bars soon revealed themselves.  Clearly, food can unify and it can divide.  It can make you feel at home; it can make you feel like a stranger in a crowd.  Inclusive, exclusive.  \\nAs we look at this passage from Acts, we might well wonder what all the food fuss was about for the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.   It was well-known that Jesus ate with all kinds of people during his ministry.  But, following his death and the spread of the Gospel message, these city folks were questioning the Apostle Peter about his associations with outsiders: “Peter, why are you eating with those uncircumcised, Gentile people?  You know their food choices do not adhere to our sacred purity code!  You become impure yourself by eating with them; their food may have already been offered to idols!”  This conversation may seem like splitting hairs to us: kosher, non-kosher, ritually clean and unclean food..  And Paul has already eaten with the Roman Centurion, Cornelius, and affirmed the receiving of the Holy Spirit by Cornelius and his entire household.  This is beyond our contemporary debates and accomodations around certain dietary restrictions.  Food was a deep religious identity issue for Jews, as they struggled against assimilation under the dominant Roman regime.\\nHow might Peter’s strange vision, of a sheet descending down from the sky and filled with all kinds of animals and birds, give us a glimpse of God’s new intentions?  How did a curious assembly of edible creatures, all of which were considered non-kosher, unclean, give this observant Jewish apostle of Jesus an intuitive flash of God’s new directions in redeeming the world?  For those who know Hebrew scripture, this jumble of animals on a table cloth would remind the of  heavenly banquet table imagery: the arrival of God’s reign of justice and peace where everyone is included at the table.  Not unlike a welcoming church potluck, it is a vision of all kinds of people bringing all kinds of food.  Think about it:  church potlucks are a place where we enact God’s inclusive reign on earth: gather together, no boundaries, we trust in each other’s cooking abilities and cleanliness standards and we try new things.  \\nPeter recounts this bizarre vision to the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who still believe that followers of Jesus, of the Way, should also adhere strictly to Jewish dietary and circumcision laws.  Peter has been of similar mind, but something has started to change within him as he sees so many different kinds of people drawn to the teachings and presence of Jesus.  One commentary I read this week notes that Peter’s act is “boundary deconstruction.”  (working preacher ref, May 19, 2019). The Jerusalem leaders could have kept Cornelious and his household at arms length, until they passed some probabtionary period as new Christians.   But apparently God has little patience with this kind of border keeping.  \\nWe might think about new people coming to a congregation.  Over the years, I have observed that the presence of new people inevitably changes the culture and the future of that church.  But this is often problematic for those who have been around for awhile, like those who were raised as Jews within the centuries old Jewish tradition.  In an effort to explain not only why he was sharing food and lodging with gentiles, Peter has to justify why the Roman (gentile) centurion Cornelius was allowed to be baptized as a new Christian.    We might well imagine Peter’s own revulsion to this dream of clearly non-kosher animals such as pigs, shellfish and reptiles, tumbling together on the descending cloth.  But apparently God is not too concerned by what seems unusual, even distasteful to us.  This may be important to remember as we find ourselves resisting certain changes in church institutions. \\nPeter continues with his story in front of the circumcised believers in Jerusalem.  “And not only that, but then these men from Cornelius’ house appeared, who were obviously Gentile, and the Spirit told me to not worry about that but to head to the town of Joppa and preach the good news to this entire household of Gentiles, Cornelius’ very house, and the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning!”  “Now tell me,” continues Peter,  “my brothers and sisters in Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?”  And the room of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem fell silent.  They are reminded of their own prophets’ insistent teaching that God’s intention was to reach out beyond their religious tradition to include the whole world in redemption.  Suddenly these Jerusalem Christians break into praise, proclaiming, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”   Interesting.  The conserving, resistant element in the Jerusalem group was able to look back at the best of their own tradition, and with that reminder they were able to discern the way forward into change.  This gets me wondering, in what ways have we been “hindering God” around here?  When has this congregation been at its best and how might elements of that legacy move us forward in this transition period?\\nWe also might do well to pay attention to what we find to be off-putting, a tad disturbing as we move through the coming days.  Where is God calling each of us deconstruct borders, to break down exclusionary walls?  Surely, we will each bump into someone, some situation this week, some new idea around here, that will make our nose wrinkle or our stomach churn.  We are bound to encounter a part of humanity that we would just as soon exclude from our circle. The new person at church that has a few too many unusual ideas or someone in a same sex relationship or speaking with a foreign-sounding accent, someone with just too many tattoos or the wrong color skin or their gender expression makes us cringe.   We might want to pay attention to our discomfort, as we move through the various circles of our days.  Our discomfort may be a signal for us about the new thing that God is up to next.  Like God giving “even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life” we read in the Book of Acts.   \\nAs if a tablecloth full of animals and birds isn’t enough strange metaphor for one Sunday, the author of Revelation presents us with vision of a city radiant and holy as a bride, descending to earth.  Frankly my inner feminist bristles at  this bridal imagery, but again, I remind myself, think metaphorically!  In the ancient world, cities were invariably represented by the feminine.  Roman sculpture often depicted conquered cities as shackled female slaves.  How’s that for the denigration of a certain gender?  The author of Revelation, writing under the cover of metaphor to challenge Roman rule, is doing something different.  In this pointed political diatribe denouncing the vile, gaudy, imperial corruption of the Roman Empire, he envisions God redeeming our whole planet.   This is different from modern day misrepresentations of the Book of Revelations, such as the Left Behind series.  Here we have an image of God embracing our material world and making the earth itself new.  There is actually no rapture or snatching up of faithful Christians away from nasty earth in this book.  “See,” says the loud voice from the throne, “the home of God is among mortals; God will dwell with them; they will be God’s peoples.”  \\nThe author’s vision doesn’t talk about escaping this place of repression; it describes earth being transformed.  Earth being the place where all will be saved from injustice, all barriers and tears wiped away, where repressive systems will be dismantled, mercy and reconciliation will reign. God here, in our dwelling and living, breaking down barriers, even in our sharing church pews and potluck with one another.   How then will we, First Congregational UCC, be part of God’s barrier-deconstructing plan?  How will we be part of this new heaven and new earth?  We have much to explore together in the days to come.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'Both of today’s scripture readings include dramatic interaction between humans, the forces of evil and God.  The Genesis story offers this mythological tale of the first humans, Adam and Eve, complete with talking animals and a mystical garden.  The humans are confronted with the temptation to be more than human and to embrace God-like powers of certain knowledge and immortality.  There is a lot that this story is not about, in my opinion.  Briefly stated: This ancient Jewish story from 10th century BCE is not a scientific description of the how humans appeared on earth.  Nor is it intended as a condemnation of women (that comes later in church history – think “justicification for persecuting witches – 15th century CE).  The serpent is not the devil; personification of evil comes much later, influences from Persian religion.  Probably most importantly is not about original sin either – a flawed nature we all inherit because of A and E’s disobedience.   Biblical commentators have noted that the first time Hebrew scriptures mention “sin” is later, when Cain kills Abel.  Perhaps our “original sin” is retaliatory violence that attacks creation’s well-being? (Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki).  \\nSo what to make of this story – that has wrecked such havoc in it’s misinterpretations??!!  It is a foundational mythological tale that attempts to explain our present condition of human life, all its messiness and brokenness.  A life where we often pretend we are God-like as we overreach our limits and then we blame others.  It reminds me of how I loose my sense of precious creatureliness.  We forget we are created in God’s image: we become ashamed and fearful, we hide from God and become estranged from each other.  Good stuff to consider in Lent.  Our Wednesday morning Bible study really went to town with this scripture last week; it’s a scripture text well worth more than a quick mention in a Sunday sermon.  \\nThe Matthew story is a description of Jesus being tempted in much the same way.  We have no idea if this was a literal encounter with some personalized face of evil, or an equally harrowing vocational struggle within Jesus own psyche.   His public ministry of teaching and healing has not started yet.  Following his baptism by John the Baptism, he heads to the wilderness on what could be described as a vision quest.  What is this urgency within me?  This sense of God calling me to do…what?  Engaging the time-honored spiritual practice of fasting, honing his spiritual attentiveness, he confronts – what – his shadow side?  Hallucinations?  Matthew calls it “the devil” – which means basically “adversary” in this context.  Forget the red guy with horns and a pitchfork, or visions of Dante’s “Inferno.”  Think poetic language to describe great truth!  Jesus is invited, beguiled, to take on impressive powers that are admired and celebrated in the human kingdoms of the world.  These promised powers will make him great in humans eyes, maybe even spread his message further!   But yielding to these temptations will ultimately run contrary to his purpose.  He is to be the one who preaches the “alternative community,” or the radical reversal of assumptions about status and power in God’s Kingdom.  A reign marked by Self-sacrifice, vulnerability, humility.    \\n\\tThe adversary, pushes Jesus to face the implications of the words from God at his baptism:  “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”  “If you are the Son of God,” taunts the adversary, “how about this?  Important to remember that first century hearers of this story would not immediately associate the title “Son of God” with meaning Jesus was divine.  “Son of God” was a honorary title well known in Judaism:  Kings in the Davidic line during Israel’s golden age were called “Sons of God” and the people of Israel are sometimes themselves called “Sons of God.”  But maybe most importantly, in the first century Greco-Roman world, human emperors were using this it.  “Son of God” was an honorary title for the Caesars, who lived extravagant lifestyles, had the power of a huge army behind them and ruled with an iron fist.  “If you are the Son of God,” the adversary says, “if you are going to be high and mighty like the Caesars…. snears the adversary. What kind of Son of God are you, really?”  \\n\\tThe tests that follow are pretty tempting, not so much because Jesus is hungry and tired.  They are tempting because they challenge Jesus to get really clear about what he is called to do and not do in his ministry.  And they are confusingly tempting because they contain partial truths:  “Come on Jesus, I know you are going to be concerned about the needy and the hungry!  Let’s get started here, by turning these stones into bread.  Hey Jesus, God’s reign of justice and peace is a real challenge to earthly corrupt powers.  Don’t you want to have dominion over the kingdoms of the earth so you can get this Kingdom of God thing started in the right way?!”   Finally, the adversary even turns to quoting promises from the Psalms:  God’s protection is promised to the righteous who call on God’s name!  In an ironic twist, the adversary suggests Jesus try this out in the center of Israel’s holy city and sacred Temple.   So Jesus, you certainly are righteous; how about you just fling yourself off this Temple balcony?  Go ahead, lean into those promises of the ever gracious and saving God!   \\nIt’s one thing to say no to something that we know is really wrong.  But what about the places in our lives that seem less clear.   The day-to-day ethical choices that are awash with partial truths, with ambiguity; a simple statement that borders on a tiny lie, a misrepresentation about ourselves or someone else, Saying we think or feel something when we really don’t.  Leaving parts out of a certain story when we talk with our suspicious parent or spouse.  All those small, grey-area part-truths can test us over time.  These are the messy places in our lives where we are faced with choices.  These are the very places where God calls to flourish by making the choices that reflect who we really are.  Created in God’s image, beloved, forgiven children of God.\\nThe question before us during Lent is always:  who is this Jesus?  What kind of Son of God is this?  He is the one who will not live with half-truth; he will not portray God as a magic trick waiting to fulfill our every desire.  We watch Jesus struggle with understanding his call, his vocation as God’s Son.  And by choosing to live out the full truth of who he is, Jesus will face enormous consequences.  His teaching and healing will invite many into God’s saving grace, and it will also begin to incur the wrath of public authorities.  On this first Sunday in Lent, we might well wonder to ourselves:  what would it mean for me to more fully live into God’s will for me, as God’s beloved child?   What full truth about ourselves are we each being asked to face this day?  Such are the questions of the Lenten season.  Thanks be to God. Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAfter hearing the conclusion to that Matthew text, I am tempted to say: “a pair of scissors, please!”  I want to cut these offending passages out of the Bible because they are such a turn-off.  Angels sorting out evil ones from the righteous ones and throwing them into the “furnace of fire?” “Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth?” I’m confused here: Will the fish weep and gnash their teeth or is this people in the afterlife?  Passages like this can be downright distracting:  Firey furnances, weeping and gnashing of teeth seem to have little to do with God’s grace and extravagant welcome.  Did really Jesus say these verses?  I must admist, I really couldn’t blame him for a few nasty zingers towards those who were opposing him.  At this point in his brief ministry, he has already gotten word that some of the argumentative religious leaders have accused him of working for the forces of evil.  And, they were now conspiring to kill him.  Frankly, it makes Jesus a bit more real and accessible to me if he isn’t always nice.  Which he wasn’t.   Apparently, he would flip over a few tables once and awhile, speak testily about his frustrations with those who grasp for money and power, who bully, marginalize and exclude people! “You!  You brood of vipers you!  Yes, you….in the end God is going to sort it out and your teeth will gnash!”  Maybe Jesus didn’t actually all say this, but the Gospel writer Matthew senses the spirit of the Risen Christ saying it to his community who is under heavy persecution in the late first century CE.  \\n\\tBut don’t stop there with the scissors:  What about this story from Genesis with its patriarchal, tribal society where polygamy and forced sex with your slave women appears to be a sanctified way to extend your clan?  A story of mistaken identity –  “yikes!” cries Jacob the morning after, “who did I marry and sleep with last night?” – This Jacob who cheated his own brother Esau out of birthright and father’s blessing by pretending he was someone else.  How in the world is God present and working through such deception and trickery?  Thomas Jefferson cut all the offending parts out of his Bible, why don’t we?   And yet, these are the very people God works through, down the ancestral line, to bring a “light to the nations” of a society that at it’s best will be a beacon of justice and compassion. Down the ancestral line, all the way to Jesus of Nazareth. \\n\\tHere’s my first thought on passages like this:  I have to be careful not to let my initial repulsion distract me from the intent of text as a whole.  Emmaus may be a congregation of “many paths,” but we don’t gather together just to each make up a spirituality that suits each of us individually.  We are both grounded, and challenged, by the Biblical story that makes an audatious claim that God works through fallible humans to bring about God’s purposes of healing, justice and peace in the world.  Post-Enlightenment modern culture claims that we do all of this meaning-making and do-gooding on our own.  Theologian, Eugene Peterson in his book Christ Plays in a Thousand Places: A Conversation in Spiritual Theology, describes the inadequacy of this modern propensity well:  \\n\\t“Out of the grab bag of celebrity anecdotes, (he writes) media gurus, fragments of ecstasy, and personal fantasies, far too many of us, with the best intentions in the world, because we have been left to do it ‘on our own,’ assemble spiritual identities and ways of life that are conspicuously prone to addictions, broken relationships, isolation and violence….Much of this spirituality ends up shaped by terms handed out by the same culture” (that we are hoping to live beyond).\\n\\tI wrestle with the Biblical texts each Sunday, and in my own personal life, because I seek a “spiritual theology” as Peterson puts.  One that speaks of both my inner spiritual experience and also of the Other that is not Me – that is God. A perspective that helps me understand the “specific Christian attempt to address my lived experience.” Peterson talks how we need take our “imprecise, fuzzy and sometimes elitist spiritual energies” and “harnass them in biblical leather.”  Strong words. You want to ride the wild horse of spirituality, or more precisely, the movement of the Spirit of God?  Peterson suggests you are going to need some “Biblical leather” that guides us into “the company of Jesus” and the present-day reality of the spirit of the Living Christ among us.  I would say, this “Biblical leather” is part of the equipment we need in our travels together as a congregation.  These are not the only interpretive texts for our community, but they have to be the foundational ones.    In spite of not a few really annoying and potentially confusing passages, the Bible is where we are grounded as a church: Emmaus United Church of Christ. \\n\\tAnd our two texts today, the Genesis and the Matthew passages, seem oddly weighted on the side of small, insignificant people and things.  They point to a counter-intuitive understanding about God:  God is apparently very busy working in and through small, insignificant people and common, everyday places we usually ignore.  And we keep looking for the big stuff; the noisey splash, the dramatic occurance, the wildly miraculous game changing event….surely that is where God works, right?   \\tGod is apparently “sweating the small” stuff, all the time.  \\n\\tOver and over Jesus describes God’s workings among us, the Kingdom of God, as ambiguous, strange, small and mostly hidden.  The Reign of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, is not a far-away, after-life place.  It is shorthand for “the story of the world”…this world where God is continually working, saving and redeeming.  In spite of all evidence to the contrary, from our point of view, God is constantly challenging anti-God forces, human and spiritual, to bring about God’s justice and compassion.  Like us, Jesus’ listener’s must have had their doubts.  Jesus had a knack for “telling truth on a slant,” as Emily Dickenson would later describe this process in her poem:  \\nTell all the truth but tell it slant —\\nSuccess in Circuit lies\\nToo bright for our infirm Delight\\nThe Truth's superb surprise\\n\\nAs Lightning to the Children eased\\n\\nWith explanation kind\\n\\nThe Truth must dazzle gradually\\n\\nOr every man be blind —\\n\\nJesus would move in sideways in his teachings, on a slant, to unsettle people’s normal understandings with stories that included everyday objects and people in rather curious situations.  The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, he said, that grows and becomes a protective nest for all kinds of beings.  Mustard seed is actually a weedy garden herb in the Middle East, you would not plant it in your field.   God’s hidden workings in an ordinary small weed-like thing that makes a haven, a home for wild things.  “Bird’s of heaven” was an ancient Biblical reference for people of all nations under oppression.   The Kingdom of God as a safe, growing place of compassion and respect, like a welcoming church which is inclusive and open-minded and non-judgemental, in a time when LGBT people are still being condemned and told to change by congregations all over the country.  The Kingdom of God is a safe, growing place where people weighed down by our predominant culture’s insistence on materialism, power and priviledge can come roost together.  \\n And here’s another one, suggests Jesus.  The Kingdom of heaven, God’s workings among us, is like yeast that a woman mixes into three measures of flour until it is leavened.  What strange extravagance!  Actually 50 pounds of flour, enough to feed well over 100 people.  God’s Kingdom brings an outpouring of extravagance that is over the top.  But the word isn’t  “ she place” or  “mixes,” it is actually “she hid.”  What simple act of kindness, of generosity, will I go tuck into the world, quietly hide in the world today?  Perhaps Jesus is also being sly here?  Leaven is actually moldly sour-dough, in Biblical times often used to describe a seemingly contaminating, corrupting substance or person.  Hmmmm….God’s hidden workings, seen by the world as insignificant, even problematic.  Individual letters written to congressional representatives about our immigration laws.  A bag of clothes donated for the refugee children housed right now in Centerville.  Our persistant efforts to read and learn about Israel and Palestine, combined with the drip, drip, drip of our daily prayers for peace in the Middle East.  Lowly and insignificant slave girls to Rachel and Leah, named  Zilpah and Bilhah, who also become ancestral matriarchs of the 12 tribes of Israel.  Jesus’ followers, and later Matthew’s persecuted community, who would look around and consider:  How might be God influencing, changing this repressive world around me?  They would claim God’s hidden workings as they loved one another, and extended God’s loving care to others.   May these truths continue dazzle and guide us.

       " 'Guided Conversation #3 \\nContinued exploration of our expectations of our new Pastor:  \\nWhat can our new pastor expect from this congregation, and from you in our mutual ministry and covenantal relationship?\\n\\nBut you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.\\t\\n\\n\\tToday is the third Guided Conversation led by your Pastoral Search Committee.  The June and July GC’s helped identify your expectations about your new pastor’s role and duties, the needed qualifications and competencies: You explored how you hope this person will be and interact with you in this new covenantal relationship as your pastor and teacher.  For this morning, the Pastoral Search Committee has flipped the question about expectations:  today, you’ll consider what a faithful pastor can expect of a healthy congregation.  What can he or she expect of the membership of Falcon Heights Church in this ministry relationship where all of you are mutual engaged and mutually accountabie?  \\n\\tThe Pastoral Search Committee and I chose this passage from First Peter to help us focus this question.  This letter circulated to five churches in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), probably during the late first century. The writer describes himself as an elder, a church leader in Rome, and he is aware that Gentile Christians in this far-flung region of the Roman Empire are being persecuted for their beliefs and practices.   To encourage them, he offers several different images of who they are as followers of Jesus:  a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people.   The author is using language and imagery straight out of the Hebrew scriptures.  These are words that reminded Jewish people of the transformative Exodus event that freed, formed and delivered them as a people.  People called by God and set apart, not because they were better than anyone else, but for certain responsibilities.  And now, Jesus’ teachings, “crucifixion and resurrection….calls and sets apart another people” - the followers of Jesus, the church.  (Anthony Robbinson, What’s Theology Got to Do with It, p. 160).  Not because they are better than others, but because they have a certain task to do as a people.   To proclaim the transformative power of God in their lives.  \\n\\tWhat do I expect of a congregation?  I expect a congregation to wrestle with this call to “proclaim the mighty acts of God who called you out of darkness into God’s marvelous light. To not shy away from talking about how God is working in your lives because this seems like an arrogant claim.  Or because so-called Christians, aligned with political power down through the ages, have misused this status as God’s people, and vilified and oppressed others with this claim.  I expect a healthy congregation to step up and be church:  to live into being chosen by God.  Not in an exclusive way, that denigrates other Christians and other world religions.  I expect a healthy congregation to move away from thinking about church as a club or community group where people hold membership, and that the pastor’s job is to keep the member/customers happy.   \\n\\tYes, I do expect a congregation to be healthy in that they treat each other and their pastor with respect and compassion.  That people will tell me, not someone else, if I have done something to bug them or hurt them.  But beyond these expectations about being a loving community, I hope that people in my congregations will simply talk more about God than about church.  I expect us to spend more energy exploring out loud our sense of connection with God, with Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and what this is doing in our lives.  How it guides what we do around here as church.  And to talk openly and honestly about our sense of disconnection from God, our wondering, our questioning.  To talk about how this intimate, personal relationship is affecting each of us, nudging us, challenging us, transforming us.  To talk less about church, and more about God.   That’s what this one pastor, who herself seeks to be faithful in following Jesus, expects of her congregation.  Amen.\\n\\n\\t\\n ',\n",
       " '\\tI sometimes wonder what it was like to receive a letter from the Apostle Paul, like the ones we consider today.  The young churches in Ephesus and Corinth were both in major cities and centers of commerce, filled with a variety of people from all over the Roman Empire.  In the midst of their squabbles and struggles over leadership and how to be church together, they get these messages from their founding pastor Paul. He has heard they have problems.  I am struck by the way Paul invites them to take a step back, to “go up to the balcony” so to speak, and consider who and what they are as church.  \\n\\n\\tPaul’s actually like a good marriage counselor who won’t allow the couple to stay stuck in a blame game of finger pointing.  In all of Paul’s 100 references to the word church in his letters we have preserved in the New Testament, he is never refers to church as a building.  The English word “church” is translated from the Greek work ekklesia, which means assembly.  In Paul’s day it meant a particular assembly or gathering of those who follow the way of Jesus.  In these passages we just heard, Paul is asking the ekklesia, the assemblies in these Asia Minor cities of Ephesus and Corinth to consider a wider view of church. It’s like a marriage counselor who hears the frustrations of past interactions and hurts and says to the couple, “well, let’s see if we can envision what you would want your marriage to be like.”  The counselor invites the couple into considering the marriage as a third entity in the room, besides the two partners.  The two don’t become one, they become three!  This third entity needs attention, re-imagining, care and feeding.  How will they sustain this precious relationship in the future?  I suggest that the Apostle Paul is inviting us to do the same today; take a step back and consider a wider historical perspective about church, and ponder together about how these images of being an assembly of followers of Jesus might inform our way forward.\\n\\n\\tPaul speaks of the church community in a wild mix of ways:  the ekklesia is a not strangers or aliens (the word used to refer to those Rome had conquered) but a group of citizens in the household of God, a temple, a holy dwelling place for God, the Body of Christ.  Let’s be careful not to hear these metaphors through the assumptions of later politicized Christendom, when the church claimed to be the only way to God and everyone else is damned.  Paul is simply talking to those who have chosen to follow the way of Jesus, together.  He uses numerous other metaphors for church that we won’t even get to today:  ekklesia as family, children of God, bride of Christ, city on a hill, light to the nations. I suggest we sink into a few of these metaphors and see where they lead us in our thinking about being an assembly in this time, in this place.\\n\\t I’ve worked with churches as an Intentional Interim Pastor over the years, many who were emerging out of a time of conflict. Underneath the debates, I sensed a stuckness.  I would notice a sense of loss over what church has been in the past and an unacknowledged unraveling of shared assumptions about its future.  People would talk about their Congregational heritage and how the church is run like a democracy; everyone gets a vote and no one from the outside tells them what to do.  “Wait a minute,” I would think to myself, “this isn’t all of our Congregational heritage.  Something is missing here!”  \\n\\n\\tA fellow United Church of Christ pastor from Massachusetts, The Rev. Martin Copenhaver gave a recent talk to the Massachusetts Conference of the UCC, and it reminds me of this missing piece.  Martin was also concerned by the contentiousness and conflict he experienced in many church meetings.  Looking back at our American church history he writes: As our Congregational ancestors came to this country in the early 17th they “felt called to a different kind of church than what was represented in the state church, the Church of England.”  Most importantly they believes that  “no individual—be it a bishop, priest or lay leader—is fully equipped to discern and follow God’s will. “These early Congregationalists believed that the workings of the Holy Spirit could be discerned in community by receptive hearts that are molded in prayer. Indeed, the very name “Congregational” derives from the understanding that it is the congregation, informed by scripture and molded in prayer, that is best able to discern what Christ would have them do. They put into practice their understanding that the gathered community is the true vessel of the Spirit of Christ—a term that they used often. They met often and their meetings were seen as opportunities to encounter God in their midst.” (“Discernment and the Congregational Way,” Keynote Address to the 209th Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Conference, November 1, 2008 by The Rev. Martin B. Copenhaver) \\xa0\\n\\tYikes.  Our gatherings, our deliberations, will only draw us closer to God and one another, and to serving God’s wider purposes, if we are “informed by scripture and molded by prayer.”   That’s our heritage…..that’s the continuing purpose of the wider United Church of Christ of which we are a part.  Without each of us individually soaking in and praying on the Biblical language our church decisions become based on our own individual preferences.  They are based primarily on our own sometimes clouded thinking and a projection of our personal needs.  Then we take a vote on whose preferences “win.”  \\n\\n\\tIt was difficult for the church in Corinth to not let the accustomed hierarchies of the Roman world infiltrate their community of worship and service together.  Who had the most money, who had been around the longest, who has the highest stature or influence in the community; wouldn’t these naturally be the “deciders” in the congregation?  But Paul offers this image of a body, one that was common in Roman culture for reinforcing the need for a “head” who bossed people around and “hands and feet” that did all the dirty work.  No, says Paul, you all, you the church, the gathered assembly, are the body of Christ.   He’s using metaphorical language to get his readers to think outside of the box.  Thinking about Jesus who taught, died and was raised from the dead is not just idea to consider.  Paul insisted that the spirit of the risen Christ, the Messiah, is so intimately present in the gathered body of followers of the Jesus Way, that they become like a living organism together.   Interconnected, like a foot and a finger and an arm and a neck are to a human body.   And this living organism needs care and respect.  I think we need to pay attention to this metaphor.\\n\\n\\tI received two immunizations this week as part of my annual physical.  “Which arm?” asked the nurse as she laid out the shots before me.  “How about one in each,” I answered confidently.  “You want both arms to be sore?” she quipped.  “Uh, no.  Go for the left arm.”  Later I had to laugh, as the ache and lack of mobility in my left arm was enough to throw my whole sense of well-being off kilter.  One arm, two arms….whatever…..my whole body was affected because my arms can’t say: we don’t belong to the body.  Arm hurts, body hurts.  Even in the midst of our disagreements as a congregation, I sense we are experiencing some of this body awareness that Paul describes:  We all ache at some level.  He speaks of our need to honor the weaker parts of our communalness, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.\\xa0 If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.  Holding one another to accountability is one thing.  But mean-spiritedness and disparaging of one another seldom builds up the Body of Christ that is us.   It hurts the whole body that is us as church.\\n\\n\\tThere is a curious tenderness to Paul’s images of church.  In his letter to the Ephesians, there is none of the “church triumphant” militaristic imagery that will regrettably emerge in later centuries as Christianity aligns with political power.  Here, Paul urges this mid-first century congregation to be who they are: a dwelling place for God. Almost as if the church is where a new politics is practiced, where “a different kind of power, the self-outpoured, boundary-cross power” of God is poured out.  Where we learn to “trust this power, letting it undermine every wall (that comes between us, until we are ‘built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.’” (Brian Petersen, from http://www.workingpreacher.org/preaching.aspx?commentary_id=3748).\\nOf course we are not the only dwelling place of the divine, denigrating other spiritual traditions. But we are a collected people who are a temple of God’s spirit.  We are not totally complete but are ever growing and renewing ourselves as this temple. “You are being built,” Paul reminds the Ephesians.  I think that’s us, Church!  We are an on-going construction project of the Spirit, an assembly of Jesus followers, a living organism, a precious dwelling place that needs our prayerful and tender care.  Amen. ',\n",
       " '\\tAnd another person would add, yeah, that’s the story we heard.  And we tell that story to each other even today, to remind us that we are all part of the miracle of sharing God’s message of love and justice and peace.  Someone else would interrupt – miracle, schmericale – people just spread the story because we’re supposed to believe Jesus was both human and divine.  I think the real miracle was that everyone just finally shared their picnic lunches with each other!\\nWell, I tell you, continued the interrupted person, Sometimes the needs around us are so overwhelming, and we don’t have much to give, but we realize that if we can offer what we have to the Risen Jesus…..somehow they miraculously get multiplied!  We start to realize that it’s not all about us and our finally becoming generous…..it’s the miracle of what God can do through us!  And God is able, through us, to provide more than just tangible bread, but the also the transforming presence of Jesus living spirit in people’s lives!\\n\\tOver the years, these different memories got written down, in what we call the four Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke and John – for different communities of followers of Jesus.   And this is the one miracle story that all four Gospels include.  I think it’s because the story is maybe less about Jesus and the amazing things he did, and more about what it means to be his disciple, his follower.   Jesus asks them, and asks us, “what do you have?”  And it never really feels like enough, does it?  When Millard and Linda Fuller started Habitat for Humanity in the 1970’s, they had very few resources.  They saw a huge need for “affordable and decent housing for the working poor.”  They started with just a few tools and a few volunteers, and it would have been easy to say (like Jesus’ disciples did at first) “what are they among so many?”  But their “passion for justice grounded in the experience of the Risen Jesus in their lives pushed them forward.  “Today Habitat for Humanity serves as a clear testimony to the multiplying power of” God’s love and grace.  \\n\\tWhen faced with all the needs of the world, you and I may feel too young or too small, too busy or too old or too tired.  But we place what we have in Jesus’ hands.  With all our human weaknesses and limitations, it turns out that it will be more than enough.  The spirit of the living God will multiply our resources so we aren’t just giving people our human hand-outs….we are showing them God’s amazing overflowing abundant love and grace!   Let’s witness this sacred story of the feeding of the 5000!',\n",
       " 'What is important to me in all this is that we don’t stop the conversations there, with our pronouncements and then politely backing off from deeper exploration.  Too often we try to affirm theological diversity in an effort to be non-judging and welcoming…and it can begin to sound like “what you believe doesn’t matter.”  We don’t hold up certain intellectual affirmations about various doctrines as a pre-requisite for participating in or joining Emmaus, and I don’t see certain beliefs as buying us a safe seat in some heavenly afterlife.  But I do think it matter what we each believe, and we need to be curious to know this part of one another.  I find I need my beliefs and assumptions to be respectfully questioned periodically.  The loving challenge of a faith community which invites me to think and reflect upon how my perspectives intertwine with how my life is really going and how I relate with God. \\nI was recently reading the book Reimaging Christianity: Reconnect Your Spirit without Disconnecting Your Mind by The Rev. Alan Jones’, previous dean of Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco.  When he described the purpose of his Cathedral congregation, I recognized Emmaus, a much smaller church:  He said that the Cathedral sought to “be a place of meeting and safety for people on the move spiritually.”  Many paths, traveling together….Emmaus United Church of Christ.  A “place for real conversation about God, reality and the hole in our soul,” is the way that Dean Jones boldly described it.  A place where questions are encouraged and conversation fostered.  Not because it doesn’t matter what we each believe, but because it really does matter to who we are and how we choose live in the world.  It matters to how we deal with an inner reality best described by the medieval mystical tradition:  there is a hole, an opening, a space within each of us that is our capacity for God. A God-shaped space that yearns to be filled with God. \\nJesus never seemed too concerned about what people believed.  He seemed much more interested in this God-shaped opening, space, within people and what they filled it with. In this week’s story from Matthew, Jesus has just finished interacting with a huge crowd, curing the sick, teaching and finally feeding the whole lot of them….all direct acts of compassion and highly symbolic enactments of what the Reign of God on earth might look like.  He has told his disciples to take a boat, and go on ahead to the other side of the 8-mile wide Sea of Galilee.  “I’ll send the crowds home and catch up with you later.”  Then Jesus goes up into the hills to pray, meditate, reflect.  It’s quiet, nighttime.  The boat with his friends is now far from land.  Wind and waves start to kick up. Sometime in the hours before dawn, Jesus sets out across the sea and walks toward their boat on the water.  And here is where our post-Enlightenment brains screech to a halt.  From our worldview, walking on water is impossible and ridiculous to contemplate!\\nWalter Wink explores different world views, in his book The Powers that Be: Theology for a New Millennium:  He describes the ancient way of picturing the nature of things where “everything earthly has its heavenly counterpart and everything heavenly has its earth counterpart.” (p. 15). Their world was thick with God and various lesser spiritual beings, over which God ultimately ruled.  Throughout his ministry, Jesus would confront and challenge various spirits of inner disorder and outer chaos.   The disciples were scared in today’s story because water spirits were commonly known as one such manifestation of evil spirits.  \\nLater, as described by Wink, a “spiritualist worldview” emerges around 2 CE.  “Spirit is good, matter is evil.  We are trapped in bodies.”  The “materialist worldview” of the Enlightenment takes hold centuries later; quantifiable matter is all that matters.  “In reaction to materialism,” writes Wink, theologians postulated a supernatural realm, not known by the senses.” (p. 18) Reality is now split in two: science tells us the how and religion tells us the why.  The two realms gets hermetically sealed off from one another.  Finally, suggests Wink, an “integral worldview” is emerging – think new physics, liberation and feminist theology, Native American traditions, Buddhist thought, the Christian process theologians…an “integral view of reality that sees everything as having an outer and an inner aspect…..where heaven and earth, inner spiritual reality and outer physical manifestation are seen as inner and outer aspects of a single created thing.  Everything is in God and God is in everything.  This perspective helps me hear this story anew: \\n Imagine yourself as a disciple: tired, cold, sleepy, out all night, just trying to hold boat steady.  “Wait a minute, one of them says….What is that??!!  It’s looks like a ghost out on the waves!”  I tell you, I can relate.  I think I’m seeing “ghosts” periodically.  I don’t mean dead spirits, necessarily,  I mean dead ideas that haunt my head.  Ideas that don’t work anymore, like:  I can make a church do something they don’t want to do!  I can manage my adult children’s relationship with one another!  Ghostly misgivings or grudges that float through my heart.  Dark and stormy night of the soul?  Yeah, I’ve seen a few “ghosts!”  What do you see in the dark?\\nSeeing this apparition, the disciples are pretty freaked out.  But suddenly, they hear a voice.  “Take heart; It is I.”  Actually, the words are: Take heart; I AM.  Do not be afraid.   Jesus echoes the words that Moses heard from the burning bush, way long ago while his people were enslaved in Egypt. Moses says, tell me your name, who shall I say sends me:  I AM WHO I AM, says God.  My name?  I AM.  \\nTake heart; it is I.  I AM.  Do not be afraid, says Jesus.  Peter calls out:  “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” What is Peter doing?  “if it is you” ??    Wow…what more does Peter want?  Jesus is walking on choppy water, through the wind towards him.  It’s me, don’t be afraid, take heart.   But isn’t this like us?  We receive a sign of God’s transformative presence and we just aren’t sure we can trust it?  Through the interim period together, I have experienced an increasing openness and honesty among our membership, more respectful and trusting interactions among your leadership.  However, with my departure next month, and a search process that is still about underway, we are finding ourselves once again in a time of transition, uncertainty and change for Emmaus.  Our sense of both outer and inner calm is disturbed; we can feel disoriented and disheartened. Hearts can feel bit bruised and tender in this time of transition.   As much as I much as I Iook forward to a return to Minnesota and the interesting challenge of my new interim position in St. Paul, my heart also feels a bit bruised and tender in leaving all of you, and I too feel unsettled at times.  There isn’t a full-blown storm raging around us, thank goodness, but anxiety starts to stir and we can start to second guess each other.\\n\\tMaybe this is why I can relate to Peter’s reactions in this story.    “Lord if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water!”  Lord, if it is really you, help me do something really flashy and miraculous like walking out on that water!”  I can almost see Jesus shrug and mutter to himself, you asked for it, man!  “Come on” says Jesus.  Peter jumps into the water and immediately feels the force of the wind swirling around him and becomes frightened.   Sometimes I get a bit bossy with God.  All right God, if this is really you working in my life, I think that this and so should happen.  Right now.  In the meantime, I guess I’ll go ahead and try to do the miraculous, do it all myself, walk on water.  THIS is how we often deal with our fears and our anxieties.  Our concern that the Pastoral Search Committee isn’t really doing their job.  They won’t pick the right minister and all will unravel.   We try to manage the anxiety with tough questioning and second guessing.   And then we get that SINKING FEELING….oops I’m in WAY over my head.  “Lord, save me!”  we cry.  Peter could keep sinking or he reaches for help.  For me, the opposite of faith, of trust in God, is not intellectual doubt.  It is when I get anxious and start to act like God isn’t really there.  And I have to do it all myself, under my own steam, my own brain power, my own limited perspective and energy.  God help me.   Jesus reaches out and takes Peter’s hand.  \\n\\tThe spirit of the Living Jesus will be there for us.  In the midst of these unsettling weeks where we begin to say goodbye as minister and congregation.  God is already out there is our choppy waters, extending a hand of hope and help.  Take heart; do not be afraid. Amen. ',\n",
       " '\\tRather curious to hear these two scriptures passages read together this morning.  The Apostle Paul talking about love, calling his fellow Christians to not be arrogant or rude or insisting on their own way.  And then Luke’s abrupt conclusion to the story we read last week, where Jesus is first received with welcome approval by his hometown as he speaks in his synagogue, but in today’s finale he proceeds to royally tick-off his neighbors.  To the point where they want to throw him off a cliff.  “Don’t be rude,” directs Paul.  “Listen to me as I confront you in a rude manner,” insists Jesus.  A better title for this sermon reflection might have been:  Jesus Picks a Fight: What’s Love Got to Do with This?\\n\\tLet’s move back into the scene in the synagogue and see if we can figure out what the great teacher of loving our neighbors as ourselves is doing… besides raising people’s hackles.   In the beginning of his ministry, Jesus traveled around speaking in different synagogues throughout Galilee.  In this story, he returns to his hometown Nazareth and attends worship in the synagogue with what are probably family and neighbors.  Like other men in the community, he takes a turn reading from the Hebrew scriptures; his portion is from the prophet Isaiah.  It tells about the Messiah, the expected savior of Israel who will bring good news of rescue to the poor, and release to the captives, and healing to the blind, all signs of God’s in-breaking reign of mercy and justice.  Jesus has just sat down, everyone is staring at him, and he has said, rather astoundingly to those assembled, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  Hmmmm… …murmur several people, interesting….isn’t this Joseph’s son?  Can’t you see them nudge each other: “I remember when he was just a boy, helping in his father’s carpenter shop!”  No one seems too disturbed at this point.  But then Jesus launches into this rambling diatribe, accusing the congregation that they are getting ready to oppose him.  He suggests they will demand some kind of favoritism, special miracles like he did in other towns, because he their home-town man.  Then, Jesus finishes off this assault with provocative references to several great Jewish prophets:  Elijah and Elisha, each who brought God’s mercy and compassion to outsiders.  This what finally ticks off the Nazareth crowd, because these are references to their history when they, the chosen people, did not seem to be favored.  In the first case, the prophet Elijah ignored needy Israelite widows during a famine and brought aid to a Phoenician widow, restoring and empowering her to new life.  In the second, the prophet Elisha chose among many needy lepers to heal a Syrian military commander of his leprosy, restoring and empowering him to new life.   The widow and the commander were both Gentiles, outsiders.  The healing power of God’s kingdom is to extend to those we consider to be outsiders, is what Jesus is really saying.  \\n\\tAnd the people get it and they are “filled with rage.”   Why so angry? When the marginalized are truly empowered, it tends to change the status quo.  Our resistance to this, as the insiders, seems naturally ingrained, because it may  mean loss of advantage and priviledge.    No wonder the crowd wants to get rid of him.  \\n\\tRowan Williams, former Archbishop of Cantebury and  head of the Anglican Church has been known for inviting outsiders into conversation.  He would invite those out on the edges of British society and the Anglican church, into open dialogue about spirituality and faith.  Out of these experienes, he wrote Tokens of Trust: An Introduction to Christian Belief.   He talks about one of the earliest formulations of the Christian faith, known as the Apostles Creed.  The first line of which reads:  “I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth.”  Williams admits that the patriarchal language of God as Father is problematic for some of us, but he focuses on the idea that belief is more an act of trust than intellectual assent.  It’s about trust in a loving relationship; a trust that in some essential way, we are held safe.  Not a fantasy safety where we will never be ill or injured or die.  But an inner awareness of an anchorage, a refuge, that holds our very being.  He makes an unusual comparison between this first phrase of the ancient creed and the “formula used by Buddhists when they make their statement of common purpose to their community: (A Buddhist will say) ‘I take refuge in the Buddha’, meaning, “the Buddha is where I belong, the Buddha is what I have confidence in to keep me safe.” What Williams is getting at is that our beliefs aren’t primarily intellectual ideas; they are really descriptions of a place, an inner anchorage in love, where we “find solid ground, home.”   “In you, O Lord, I take refuge,” wrote the Psalmist years ago.  What a marvelous breath-prayer to take into our week:  “In you” (inhale and pause).  “I take refuge “ (exhale and pause). \\nJesus seemed to sense his eternal refuge in God’s love; it’s what enabled him to do his ministry of teaching and healing in spite of the opposition.  His refuge in God was not a place of safety, but the place out of which he received both God’s loving comfort and God’s challenge to him.  It’s what empowered him to push the assumed boundaries of God’s mercy, even when gravely threatened.\\n\\tIn his commentary on this Luke passage, New Testament scholar Matt Skinner raises the question:  “what if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?”  That seemed to be what the folks in Nazareth were angry about.  Skinner takes a provocative leap himself in his article entitled “Immigration Reform and the Challenges of Generosity,” suggesting that we too “resist outsiders and their empowerment.”  “To empower certain people toward citizenship scares many in Americas,” he continues.  “Do we fear loosing our advantage, our priviledge?”  he asks.  In our fear, do we loose track of supporting family unity and hard work and people in need?  “What if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?” asks Skinner (Odyssey Networks, 1/29/13 posting).\\n\\tJesus challenged the hometown crowd to face their own assumptions about preferential treatment.  There had always been tension in ancient Israel between the sense of their being God’s special, chosen people and God’s ongoing outreach to the outsider.  Jesus’ message, the Good News, would be focused on the marginalized, the ones who everyone on the inside were figuring just didn’t belong.\\n\\tEmbracing this Good News is a big order for us Christian community.  Especially since, for most congregations, the marginalized people are both inside and outside the church membership.  I think Paul really understood how hard it is for a diverse group of people to work together for God’s Kingdom on earth.  His church at Corinth was filled with diverse opinions, various perspectives on the faith, different gifts for ministry.   Our toughest prophetic task may be to be the kind of place where theological, economic, social and political diversity does not unravel the unity and the loving interactions of Emmaus.  Perhaps our greatest witness as the church is to provide this experience of loving refuge, as it flowers in our patience and kindness with one another.  Encouraged and strengthened in this refuge of love, we are better able to reach out to the outsiders and disempowered beyond our doors.  All this is made possible because we take refuge ourselves in the living, loving God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tA group of men and women, all followers of this teacher and healer Jesus, now hiding inside a room in Jerusalem.  They are anxiously trying to figure out “what’s next?”  Jesus is executed and gone. Understandably worried about their own safety, they are uncertain about their future as a spiritual community. Yet many have seen him over the last 50 days since Easter, talked with him and shared a meal together with his same-yet-different risen presence.   His final words were “stay in Jerusalem, wait for the out pouring of the Spirit which will empower you to witness to my teachings and presence to the ends of the earth.”  They remember Jesus speaking of an Advocate, a helper, comforter who will come to them; this “Spirit of truth” who will come from God and testify on Jesus’ behalf among them. \\n\\tAnd so they wait, unsure about what this all means.  Suddenly, a loud whoshing of wind comes out of no-where.  “Whoah….what was that?”  They turn to one another and discover yet another  shock: there now appears to be tongues of flame on top of each of their heads.   Even more bizaare, they have each started speaking in a variety of foreign tongues they have never learned.\\n\\tThis animating and dynamic Spirit  makes things lively and sometimes unpredictable in a church like ours.  In our tradition, we claim this Spirit speaks to us individually, and it isour job to pay attention and to share those insights with one another for the good of the whole church.  When we loose track of our individual responsibility to be channels for the voice and power of the Holy Spirit, we just won’t have the juice, the gumption, the energy to push into the unknown which is vital ministry in this a rapidly changing world.  \\n\\tI tell you, I am excited about church these days.   When we really immerse ourselves in the reality that Jesus was not “in the business of providing answers, managing and quelling conflict, or reinforcing communal norms,”  something different starts to happen.  (Anthony Robinson, Transforming Church Culture).  We get it that Jesus was about drawing “attention to the gap between present realities and the Kingdom, the reign, of God.”  We can’t just be what one church leader has called “vendors of religious services for a Christian culture.”  In thinking about this reality, the Executive Board and I started looking at the difference between a problem that can be fixed with current know-how (the bathrooms need refurbishing, the memorial service needs a reception, the nursery needs a staff person) and what are called an “adaptive challenges” in churches.  Problems that just are fixed in the ways they used to be fixed.  Like being faced with the broad adaptive challenge of no longer living in American Christendom, but in a world that is “officially secular and religiously pluralistic,” with broad changes in predominant culture and society. (p. 126, Transforming Congregational Culture, Anthony Robinson).  Like looking beyond how do “we get more people to sign up as greeters and ushers” and look at the adaptive challenge of “how does the Good News of this place get spread; how are new people invited, welcomed and enfolded into this living organism that is our church.”   We have to push beyond, “how can we get people to not disagree” to “how do we really dive into this conflict, honestly, tender-hearted and respectfully, and see where this conversation takes us?”  \\n\\tMy Lutheran friend Patricia and I talk about this a lot.  She was one of my more brilliant seminary classmates, and is currently serving as Bishop of the St. Paul area Lutheran synod.  We wonder about all the adaptive challenges facing congregations, and the type of clergy and lay leadership now needed to guide them these churches.  I spotted a new book at her house the other night: it had a photo of crossed canoe paddles on the cover and was entitled:  Canoeing the Mountains.  Hmmmm…..Subtitled: Christian Leadership in Uncharted Territory, written by Presbyterian pastor and seminary professor, Rev. Tod Bolsinger.  “Canoeing the Mountains?” I said to Patricia?  Canoes belong in lakes and rivers, not charging up a mountain!\\n\\tWhich, according to this book, is just what Meriweather Lewis and William Clark discovered when they set out to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase, in the early 1800’s.  These guys were canoeists, and they were prepared to paddle an inland waterway that would lead them to the Pacific Ocean!  The expedition proceeded accordingly, for awhile, and then they ran into the Rocky Mountains.  Lewis and Clark realized that their whole expedition was built on a false expectation.  Not only did they have to abandon their trusted canoes, they had to face the adaptive challenge of crossing, surviving in, unknown terrain populated by unfamiliar people.  They ended up having to trust an “outsider” to guide them and to basically safe their necks.: A young Shosone woman named Sacagawea.  Serving as their translator, indespensible guide to the natural environment for their scientific studies and scout over new terrain, she traveled with them across the plains, over the Rockies, down to the Columbia River and finally to the Pacific.  \\n\\tOkay, church, says Rev. Bolsinger:  “paddling your canoes,” the way you once did church together, is not going to get you where you need to go.  You have to leave the canoes of old assumptions and ways of doing things, and find new navigational and leadership tools into this uncharted territory.  Here’s the part I found really compelling: Like Lewis and Clark, we are going to have to trust those who seem to be “outsiders.”  Someone who is different from you, who hasn’t been around here as long as you.  This means that it may well be the newer member who has the clearest insight into an adaptive challenges facing the church: like, re-defining and re-creating youth ministry, or being a more public “face” in this neighborhood, or understanding and advocating for social justice around Twin Cities poverty and on-going racial segregation of our communities.   It may be connecting with “outsiders” of a different culture and religion, like our English language class leaders have experienced at Fairview Community Center.  Or deepening the intial connections 11 of us made last week with the local Muslim community, as we attended the Ramadan fast breaking meal at the local mosque.  Or maybe it means contacting some of the speakers and facilitators of the numberous anti-racism forums and City task force on policing that have been held in our building through this last year.  Inviting these people to help you plan together some kind of community worship on the anniversary Philando Castile’s death.  To ask these “outsiders” to help us better understand what needs to be lifted up in worship together, to guide us in acknowledging the work that has happened and how much that remains to be done.  To invite the “outsider” to guide you in the uncharted territory of a being a predominately white church that recommitts itself to the work of dismantaling racial prejudice and inequities.  \\n\\tThe crowd that listened to the disciples speak in their own individual languages about God’s wondrous works in their own languages, weren’t sure what to make of all this.  First of all, these disciples were Galileans, or put more bluntly, country bumpkins.  But when Peter finally starts to speak, he goes to the heart of the adaptive challenges facing the Jewish community at that time:  They were living under oppressive Roman rule, where the established Jewish purity laws were further dividing the Jewish community between rich and poor, powerful and marginzalized.  Into this moment when the gap between present realities and the reign of God’s mercy and justice and peace were glaringly obvious, said Peter, God is sending the power of the Holy Spirit.  And Peter uses the words from the Jewish prophet Joel, written hundreds of years before, during another time of confusion and dislocation during the Babylonean exile.  Joel pointed to a time to come, when God would “pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, even your slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit and they shall prophesy.”  This is now, says Peter, this time of prophesy, visions and dreams coming from the “outsiders,” the ones you least expect, is upon us! Who expects this guidance and visioning to come from kids or our oldest people or slaves?  Who expected guidance, direction, salvation in terms of healing and restoration, to come from a pregnant Shoshone woman?   I wonder who might be those perceived as “outsiders” who will help direct you into the new world of ministry and service ahead?  May you be able to recognize the new guides who come your way.  Be open, be expectant, about how the Spirit will move through them in your midst.  Anday the Spirit of truth lead you together.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBecause here we are today, entering the most sacred week within the Christian year, watching Jesus enter first century Jerusalem on a crowded holiday filled with Passover celebrants.  We already sense this won’t end well.  And here we are today, listening to the early church leader, Paul, reminding a conflicted and polarized congregation from over 2000 years ago that they must be of “one heart and one mind” by taking on the “mind of Christ.”   And…Here we are today, only weeks after Pastor Beth Benson’s abrupt departure amidst disagreements, hurts and tremendous upheaval in this church.  And we aren’t really sure how this reconciliation process will end.   In a sense we are fumbling in the dark, reaching blindly through a lot of dirt.  We are expectantly searching for something fruitful, sustaining and hopeful as we move ahead together as a church. \\nSo let’s dive in.  At this point in the Gospel narrative, we find that Jesus’ audiences are resonating with his message that the Kingdom, the reign of God was at hand.  The crowds who watch Jesus enter Jerusalem are straining against the increasing tax burden and offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Roman rule.  They are appalled that statues of Roman leaders have been installed in their house of worship, the rebuilt Temple.  Caesar, the Roman Emperor, is now to be addressed as “the Son of God.”  What may be difficult for us to appreciate is how very closely their political situation was of deep religious concern to Jesus’ contemporaries.  It is within this complex, first century historical context, that we need to hear the Biblical narratives of Holy Week.  \\nFor the crowds in Jerusalem on this particular Passover feast week, they would be celebrating their release from slavery under the oppressive rule of Pharoh, hundreds of years before in Egypt.  Memories would also be fresh of the Jewish Maccabean revolt against the brutal Hellenistic ruler of Israel, Antiochus Epiphanies, about 150 years before.  When the Maccabees returned triumphant into Jerusalem, re-taking the city, people threw palm branches in their path.  But here we have Jesus, in about 33 CE, performing his own bit of street theater with a non-military and even ridiculous looking entry on a scrappy young colt.  Do the crowds think he will be a militant Messiah, bringing down the Romans with violence?  Are they joining in on the political satire, throwing palms of victory down on the ground before him and thumbing their collective noses at the Roman soldiers?   \\nThese Passover pilgrims are living in their own land, visiting their own holy city of Jerusalem, but it is now dominated by an oppressive power.  Perhaps not unlike how the original native inhabitants of our own country feel living in, for them, an occupied and alienated land. Perhaps some in this congregation feel like they are living in a “conquered” or “alienated” church, dominated by an oppressive power.\\n\\tJews in Jesus’ time would have understood him through their longing for restoration: a social and political re-building of their communal lives together that also involved a wider, universal renewal of all God’s creation; throwing off the shackles of Roman power, a restored Israel would lead a wider world into moral transformation.  Israel as a light to the world!  Prophetic visioning had begun to happen all over the region around this time, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare, believing they were living in the last days, and preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists abounded.  They were all performing signs and wonders that would signal both their intimacy with God and point to the End Times.  Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  And his vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation. (See Paula Frederickson, From Jesus to the Christ)\\nSuddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he heals the sick, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   But wait, he’s riding this puny colt.  One of the gospels even calls it a donkey.  Not very powerful looking for one supposedly leading an uprising against the Roman powers. \\nThere is something oddly subversive about Jesus’ entry.  Is Jesus is purposely revealing the subversive nature of his own Kingship.  As far as Jesus was concerned, the real power, God’s power, is not about force, manipulation, bigness, shock and awe.  Jesus knew that God’s power intentionally self-limits.  God’s domain is about self-giving.  Empowering peace, compassion and mercy.   Notice that throughout this awful week in Jerusalem, Jesus will spend “no energy protecting himself.”  (BBT).  All we will see is a continue self-emptying.  It’s really quite unnerving to watch.\\n\\tA few decades later, the early Christian teacher and apostle Paul will write a letter to his church at Philippi about Jesus’ attitude, his mind-set of self-emptying.  Reading through this short epistle, one quickly gets a sense that this congregation was struggling with some serious internal power issues.  They were constantly haggling over who gets to decide what, whose opinion matters the most, who wields the most influence in the congregation’s decisions.  In his letter to this first century congregation, Paul encourages the people to “let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.”  We may hear this as:  “now I want you all to agree on church doctrine and there will be no variation or theological diversity!”  Or perhaps it sounds like another version of Minnesota Nice, where we stare at our shoes and bit our tongues politely, then go complain to a third party. But I don’t think this is what Paul is describing.  Paul speaks of how Jesus “emptied himself.”  Paul says that Jesus,  “taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becom(es) obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.”  This is the attitude, the mindset, that determined Jesus’ actions every day of his life, including his last.   Able to see and listen to people with profound openness, Jesus invited others to be suspicious of their own certainties.  Ever curious, he pushed people to observe their own thinking patterns and ego-centric concerns.  (Susan Beaumont, Congregational Consulting Group website, Four Guiding Principles for Managing a Polarized Congregation ,February 18, 2019). \\n This mindset reveals something to us about God’s power, Paul is writing to the Philippians. The mindset of Jesus Christ was all about self-emptying.  Could it be that God’s most powerful aspect is God’s self-giving to us, out of God’s Self?  A God who empties-out God-self for all of creation, humanity, us. He will say in another letter to another congregation: Take on the mind of Christ; let yourself be transformed by the renewal of your mind. This is a tall order.  It takes energy and patience and courage to practice this counter-intuitive kind of mindset.  And it will change us.  \\nI wonder how might we talk about these challenges of “taking on the mind of Christ” as the United Church of Christ in Grand Marais?  What might this kind of self-emptying power look like among us, as we be church in new ways?  For now, Holy week lies before us.  Let us follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tWe have moved into the Season of Epiphany, where our Biblical texts focus on the “epiphany,” the revealing, or the manifestation, of Jesus to the world.  Last week: the scene with the Magi, the wisemen who arrive at the manger in Bethlehem.   The unlikely outsiders in the Birth narratives, reminding us that Jesus has come not just for an inside group, but for the whole world.  The chorus of the carol “We Three Kings” echoes through my mind as we leave this final scene of the Christmas story. “Westward leading, still proceeding, guide us to thy perfect light.”  And today, the leading by Christ’s light made visible among us: The Transition Committee who guided Emmaus through Rev. Bill’s departure, a whole parade of visiting ministers through the summer and the selection of interim leadership, now passing the torch onto the Discovery Team.  And they will now be light bearers among us during this time between before the Pastoral Search Committee for the settled minister is established.  The Discovery Team’s job will be to help us illumine and see more clearly the history and traditions, shared values and assumptions of your life together as a congregation.  Who have you been as Emmaus Church?  Who are you now?  What might be calling you to be in the future?  What kind of pastoral leadership will you need to help you fulfill this vision?  \\n\\tThis rhythm of remembering and moving ahead will reverberate through the months ahead here at Emmaus, as we see what the Light of Christ in our midst reveals to us.\\tBecause any visioning process about the future has much to do with memory, and how our memories sit within us.  This is true with individuals and also with church communities.  The Discovery Team will encourage you to do some remembering, perhaps in asking:  think back to some times when Emmaus was at its best.  Were there times when this was not true? What do you celebrate; which memories  weigh you down with frustration, sorrow, regret?   Do some of these communal memories make you long for the past, fear for the future?  Are they sources of encouragement?  How might memories about Emmaus help us better engage God’s future together?\\nI have wondered what Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan meant to him as he moved through his brief three years of public ministry.  John the Baptist invited fellow Jews of his day to step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly pushed Jesus to do this.  Here he is suddenly emerging from an obscure youth and young adulthood, and aligning himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  Later church doctrine will insist that Jesus was without sin.  But did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually “dry” himself?   Did he feel a desire to turn his life around, to quench some deeper thirst in those river water? Jesus was apparently well-read in Hebrew scripture; did this bapatism memory weave with his recollection of the ancient prophet Isaiah, who persistently reminds the Israelites of God’s tender love for them?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  In his baptism,  Jesus was affirmed as being worthy, loved and intimately connected to God, as he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”   \\nIt seems only natural that Jesus would spent much of his ministry reminding people that God found them worthy and beloved.  Yet for all our talk about encouraging high self-esteem and feeling good about ourselves, many of us who follow Jesus have a tough time with this concept.  We seem to fall on one side of the fence of the other:  We either under-estimate our value and worth as a human being, or we over-estimate it.  We constantly cut ourself down and feel less-than everyone else.  Or we move in a grandiose bubble where we are better than others, with little insight into our own fallibility, our limits, of where and how we might need to change.  Oblivious to the fact that we might be dependent on others or on God.  \\nStories down through the ages are filled with characters that see themselves as unworthy, unredeemable and unlovable, contrasted with those who strut their supposedly power and perfection. The fictional main character Jean ValJJOHNJean has become familiar to most of us through movies and stage productions, even if we haven’t actually waded through Victor Hugo’s 19th century French novel Les Miserables.  Here is someone who felt unredeemable to his core.  I have always found the scene where Jean ValJean is released from prison to be particularly riveting.  This lowly commoner had spent 19 years in the pre-Revolutionary French “galleys” as the prison colonies were called.  He was ordered to serve 5 years for having broken a pane of storefront glass and stealing a loaf of bread.  Added to this term were 14 more for 4 escape attempts.  He was a tree-pruner who fell on hard times; but by the time he is released from prison,  ValJean (John) has lost his connections with his previous life, and even his name.  Now convict #24,601, he has self-protectively retreated within himself.  “From year to year,” wrote Victor Hugo, “this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal sureness.  When the heart is dry, the eye is dry,” the author continued.  “On his departure from the galleys it had been 19 years since he had shed a tear.”  “When the heart is dry, the eye is dry….”\\n\\tValJean’s dry heart is exposed early in the story, through yet another act of thievery just after he gets out of prison.  The act appears congruent with the person he has become; someone possessed by a “dry heart.”  As I read this passage from the Book of Isaiah this week, I thought about what it is like to experience a dry heart.  To be stuck with a heart that feels so dry, parched, and rigid that we can’t seem to change our self-perceptions or our actions.  Surely those Israelites exiled in Babylon for so many years, experienced such dryness of heart, a feeling of having cried all your tears and being reduced to a dehydrated numbness within.  The prophet Isaiah tenderly reminds them of how they have been created, formed and redeemed by God. They are beloved, precious in God’s sight.\\n\\tIn Victor Hugo’s story, Jean ValJean is newly released from prison, wandering in a daze, and finally stumbls upon the home of a kindly Bishop and his sister.  They kindly give him a meal and a place to sleep for the night, but ValJean decides to steal from them. Taking some silver candlesticks, he escapes over the garden wall.  The next morning he is caught, and dragged back to the Bishop’s home by the police.  When confronted with the thief, the Bishop slyly inquires of his sister: \"was that silver ours?\"  His sister is stupefied by his question.  The Bishop continues: “I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently.\"  Speaking now to the policemen, the Bishop asks innocently: \"And he told you, that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? It is a mistake.\"\\n\\tThe police let him go. Jean Valjean is confused, and wary… \"My friend,\" resumed the Bishop, \"before you go, here are your candlesticks. Take them.\"\\n“What?” Jean Valjean is totally bewildered.  \"Now,\" says the Bishop, \"go in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night.\" The Bishop draws near to him, and says in a low voice: \"And Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man.\" Jean Valjean, who has no recollection of ever having promised anything, remains speechless. The Bishop continues in a grave whisper:  \"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.\"\\n\\t“You no longer belong to evil, but to good.”  It takes many years for this reality to sink-in for Hugo’s character.  How do we allow this message to really sink into us, as individuals and as a congregation?  We are accountable for but we don’t belong to the mistakes of our past.  We do not belong to our failures nor do we belong to the wounds received from others.  We belong to good because we belong to God.  We are God’s beloved sons and daughters, created this way as humans and reborn into Christ through baptism.  This is the Good News.  And beyond all of us, who else in the community needs to hear this message?   Absorbing this reality ourselves, and sharing it with others; this is the work of the church.  Remembering and moving on…..Some things to explore together in this Discovery time.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tWe can’t really tell from the Biblical record just when Jesus stopped appearing to people after he died.  It’s all a bit vague, and many of the recorded stories seem to contradict each other when it comes to time and place.  Since Easter, following the death and resurrection accounts of Jesus, we have been exploring these stories of his appearances to his followers.  He appeared in a garden to Mary Magdalene, in a closed room to Thomas, on a beach cooking breakfast for the disciples, on a road to the town of Emmaus with more close friends.  In all the Biblical accounts, his followers don’t recognize him at first, which strikes us as odd.  But as Jesus speaks, and as they eat together, it slowly starts to dawn on them:  Jesus is still present with us….he is not totally ticked-off that we deserted him!....he is still teaching and leading us….we can “reconstruct the kind of fellowship” we knew with him…..remember how we experienced that surprising acceptance and “mutual grace-giving” with one another and other people?  Come on! We have work to do in his name! (Williiams, p. 95).  His followers go from hiding worried about their own safety, feeling guilty they betrayed him,  to bolding telling everyone that Jesus has risen, and that his loving, forgiving presence was still present in the world.  That radical shift in perspective is rather unbelieveable in itself, and should give us pause. \\n\\tBut those of us in 21st century get particularly confounded by these post-death appearances of Jesus.  And as if these accounts haven’t been hard enough to embrace –today we have this bizarre text about Jesus rising up into the air, or in Biblical language,  “ascending into heaven.”  This scene reminds me of those wildly florid Italian Baroque paintings: lots of fluffy angels with big wings swirling around; Jesus’ bare feet disappearing into the clouds admist a burst of golden light; sad and bewildered disciples craning their necks skyward. \\n\\tThis imagery seems fanciful to many of us.  But for first century readers, stories of heavenly ascents were pretty common.  Different prophets, like Elijah and Enoch, were remembered as being lifted into heaven, as was the Roman Emperor Augustus (supposedly in full view of the Roman Senators).  Same wit the Greek hero Heracles, among others.   Authors used this ascension imagery as a literary manner of conferring divinity on a human.   The general understanding at the time was that everyone lived in what was considered to be a three-part universe:  the “heaven’s” were the top layer, in the middle was the flat earth (with its center of Jersualem for Jews), and below was some vague kind of underworld. Jews understood heaven and earth to be separated by a firmament – picture a solid inverted bowl where God’s throne sat.  Which makes Jesus teaching that the kingdom of heaven, the reign of God, is within you, all the more startling for his time.\\t \\n\\tBut speaking from this first century cosmological worldview, the Gospel writer Luke wants us to know that  Jesus came DOWN from the heavens at birth, he rises UP finally at the Ascension and sends his disciples OUT to minister in his name.  Down, Up, Out, Amen!   But, frankly, this geographic language doesn’t fit for us, because we no longer engage in a Down/Up view of the universe. \\t \\nHow does this New Testament language from the first century inform our lives today?   \\t\\n\\tI invite you to turn to the back of your service bulletin, for our final dive together into your current Mission statement…words that emerged out of your discerned Vision statement of the church you believe God is calling you to be: Seekers and servants, growing in God’s transforming love.  Let you eyes wander over the introductory paragraph of the Mission statement – the how you become that vision – here is this marvelously vivid, organic language about you all becoming “demonstration plot” for  the “transformative possibilities revealed in Jesus Christ, the Master Gardener.”  Notice again strategy #2 with the language about our own inner transformation.  Being this kind of church starts within each of you. Now, consider this:  We often look at the Biblical text and demand, somewhat imperiously, “what does this mean?”  Now, try this on:  “what kind of people do we need to be for this make sense?”  This is the question posed by the Biblical scholar Mark Branson, seminary professor and Methodist minister.  We can affirm that there may be a deeper, metaphorical meaning to this story, one that tell us about the all pervasive presence of God, as known through Jesus.  But if we are only looking to receive this as information, in our head, it won’t do anything to us.  We have to start out with the openness to being changed.  In my experience, none of the Good News of the Gospel makes a darn bit of sense unless I am willing to take the risk of being a “demonstrative plot” for God’s transformative possibilities.  Until I am willing to let go of some control in my life and be willing to change.  Rev. Branson’s suggests that if we always approach a Biblical text with “what the heck does this means?  we miss letting Scripture change us.  Yes, he writes, we interpret Scripture, but it also interprets us.  How is God forming us as we read this passage?  What kind of person do I need to be for this to make sense?  Not a pre-rational, non-scientific person.  No.  I need to be a person open to more than cognitive brain-knowing.  I need to be open to a deeper, intuitive, riskier heart-knowing for this promise of the on-going presence of the risen Jesus to make any sense.\\n\\tLooking again at those four strategies for actually doing the mission.  I think we can’t do #3 very consistently or joyfuly if we aren’t doing #4.  Without being formed by God through learning/soaking in the scriptures, and immersing ourselves in transformative experiences of worship, we just aren’t going to have the motivation and the inner juice to serve in Jesus name.  Sure, we can do it… but our egos will get all caught up in being good givers, pleasing someone other than God, working tirelessly because we think it is the civic thing to do.  I would dare say that any member of a church really has no business serving on a committee, ministry team or board, unless they are regularly doing #4.  Immersing in study and worship so the personal transformation can happen.  The church is not a civic organization or local non-profit; it is the manifestation of the Body of Christ in a particular time and place, and must be led by prayerful people open to inner formation.  Because it is the power of God’s transforming spirit that actually equips, empowers and compels us to serve in Jesus’ name.\\n\\tAnd as we are transformed, we begin to really get it about doing #3.  We realize we don’t want to just help hungry people by only donating to the food shelf. We want to learn more about the causes of the inquities, the problems with our food production and distribution, that reasons for food scarcity, food deserts in our inner cities.  We want our children to understand how the food they eat, the food other children are not able to eat, connects with Jesus’ teachings of food and mercy for all.  So the Children’s Ministry team starts planning a summer Sunday program for kids on “Food and Faith” inviting others to jump in and help out starting in June.  Through worship, study and prayer, our hearts start to soften and open and all of a sudden we realize we’re concerned with more than simply looking at our own personal prejudices that come out of sharing in white priviledge.  We want to advocate and be part of wider changes that challenge systemic racism in employment, housing, health care, education.  We start wondering what this church might do as a visible witness on the one year anniversary of Philando Castile’s shooting death in July.  What kind of community worship experience is needed, that only the one church in Falcon Heights might be able to offer?  I can’t step out in witness and service until I get clear about how the teachings of Jesus, and a sense of the power of God and the inspiriation of the Holy Spirit guide me.  If I don’t, I may be well-intentioned, but I can misdirect my energies and get burned-out quickly.  \\nAs I have listened to you all speak about what drew you to Falcon Heights Church in the first place, many of you speak  of the sense of openness and acceptance of different views about  the interpretation of Scripture and about what it means to be a Christian.  This is part of the “glue” that keeps you together, in spite of these differences; a “glue” that helps “support the weight of diversity” among you (p. 16, How to Live with Diversity in the Local Church, Stephen Kliewer).    \\nThe story of the Ascension of Jesus is one way to understand some of the “glue” or the “foundation” that is holds open-minded Christians together today.  “Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying; “don’t impose your faith or beliefs, but be ready to witness to the fresh and transforming experience of God you are having!”  We each are challenged to continue Jesus mission, fueled by this Spirit; there are people to welcome into this fellowship; there is ministry work to be done.   Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nSOME SPIRITUAL SURGERY\\n\\n\\tPresenting Bibles to our children may seem like a rather benign tradition of the church.  Sharing our living Christian heritage with the next generation!  Inviting them to “soak in the scriptures.”  It gives us a warm and hopeful feeling.  But the author of the Book of Hebrews suggests otherwise:  “The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”  Yikes, what have we just handed our third graders?  One Bible commentator notes that the author Hebrews is really saying that we need to immerse ourselves in God’s word because we all need “daily spiritual surgery!”  (Feasting on the Word, Year B, Vol. 4, Susan R. Andrews, p. 162).  Ouch.  But, as the commentator, a Presbyterian pastor named Susan Andrews notes, there is a difference between slicing into our soul and being judged and condemned by God.  God wants to cut away the “veneer of self-absorbed living” explains Andrews.  And yes, “spiritual surgery can be painful.”\\n\\tI suggest we see for ourselves how this might be true.  Our Gospel reading from Mark is a great place to see some “spiritual surgery” in action.  Let’s re-enter the scene from Mark, and watch Jesus and his followers set out to resume their journey to Jerusalem.  They are headed to the center of first century Jewish life and worship, but apparently have stopped in some town in Judea for a spell.  It’s now probably early in the morning; best to get going in the cool of the day.  Has Jesus been staying at a friend’s home as he has been teaching in this part of Judea, beyond the Jordan?  Perhaps he enjoyed a meal the night before, conversation and story-telling, playing with the children of the household.  Now they are leaving; a flurry of goodbyes, hugs, departing words, hearty slaps on the shoulder.  And suddenly, in the midst of the farewells, a man runs up to Jesus.  He appears out of nowhere and seems filled with urgency.  He quickly kneels at Jesus’ feet:  “Good Teacher,” he pants, “what….what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  Who is this guy?  First, we notice that he isn’t standing before Jesus, but kneeling.  Whenever the Gospel of Mark describes someone as coming for healing or the healing of a loved one, they are depicted as kneeling before Jesus.  That’s the first thing to wonder about:  what does this stranger want healed?  We are not sure.  Next, notice what he asks Jesus:  “what do I have to do to inherit eternal life?”  I suggest we be careful NOT to assume the man is asking how to get to heaven and stay out of hell.  Most Jews during the time of Jesus already believed in the eternal soul that would continue living in the World to Come following their death.  Jewish tradition focused on ethical and holy living in the present as part of being in covenant with God, not for reward.  But What is he asking for?   \\n\\tI think the man is asking Jesus how to get or achieve something in the present.  Remember that he is kneeling.  The man (we have yet to find out that he is rich) is asking for some kind of healing:  inherit eternal life.  The guy drops to his knees, in a “heal me” position and asks about what he needs to do, now, today.\\n\\tWatch what Jesus does with the question.  As he often does with a serious issue, Jesus goes side-ways and deal with it indirectly.  Jesus starts by challenging the man on his use of the title “Good Teacher.”  “Why do you call me good?  No one is good but God alone.”  Now that’s interesting.  Jesus could have added, “and you are asking me about how you are to be good?  or gooder?  So you can get something?”  Jesus quickly runs through a number of the traditional commandments from the man’s tradition, familiar to us as Christians.  “You want to do something; well, pay attention to your tradition; all this is totally doeable!”  “But Teacher,” replies the man, “I have kept all these since my youth.”  I don’t think the guy is bragging; he is just clarifying.  What he doesn’t say, but I wonder if he was thinking:  “Jesus, I need some deeper healing here; I am a good and moral person…but something is not right in me.”  \\n\\tWatch the text here for what happens next.  Verse 21:  “Jesus, looking at him, loved him.”  In the original language of the Gospels, Aramaic, the words mean, Jesus gazed at him, straight in the eye,  and with great tenderness, compassion, love.  What did Jesus see?  What was Jesus responding to in this man?  I think of myself when I am flailing around inside my head; what to do next, how to handle this or that, how to fix my worried, grasping, hard-working, anxious self.  I try to imagine Jesus looking at me.  Next time you find yourself in that place, of overwhelm, of How-in-the-world-can-I-do-this-better, imagine Jesus gazing at you, with reassuring compassion.  And then….well, to be blunt, here comes the surgery part.  What is that commonly heard phrase:  God loves me just as I am.  And God loves me enough not to let me stay that way? I am not sure what news God will have for me in my next overwhelmed and panicked moment, or what news God will have for you, but if it’s anything like what Jesus tells the rich man….hang on to your hats!  God’s news, God’s words to us can cut us to the quick.  Which apparently, is just what needs to happen.\\n\\tWhat does Jesus say to the man kneeling before him, who pleads for a healing of his present, of his immediacy?  With great love, Jesus says: “You lack one thing…are you ready?  This will heal you:  go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”  What?  That is the prescribed treatment:  surgery, cutting off the guy’s tremendous wealth.  How does the man respond?  I feel sad everytime I read this part, as I might very well react in the same surprised and dejected manner:  “When the man heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.”   The man asks for the next things he should do.   Jesus, a spiritual surgeon if we have ever seen one, cuts deep.  And he doesn’t just tell the man to get rids of his possessions.  Jesus tells the man to give the proceeds from selling his belongings to the poor.   Now, we can understand how this might be healing for people living in poverty.  But how is this going to heal the rich man?  I wonder if what Jesus is really telling the man is this:  what you need to do is change your relationship with the poor.  Give to the poor, connect with them.\\n\\tThe man is shocked.  He leaves the scene, grieving.  So, what was hurting inside the rich man?  Surely he wasn’t hungry, nor was his family if he had one.  He wasn’t plagued with anxieties about providing for people he loved.  His wealth would have given him certain prestige and power in his community.  Those around him, according to the religious custom of the day, would have viewed his riches as a sign of God’s blessing.  What needed healing in this guy?\\n\\tImagine you were in the crowd.  Maybe you knew this man.  What might you or I be thinking at this point?  “Gheez, Jesus, that’s pretty harsh!”   At this point Jesus looks around at all of us, and remarks to his disciples:  “how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the Kingdom of God!”  Notice how Jesus immediately equates “eternal life” with “Kingdom of God.”  For Jesus, the concern is about the now, about helping people enter into the realm of God, experience abundant life, in the present.  And, clearly, there is something about possessions, and the money that enables all those things that we own… something about all of this that is gets in the way of the one thing we really want.  Jesus is constantly going at the things that get in the way of connection, relationship:  our relationship with God, with other people and with ourselves.  It wasn’t that he thought money was necessarily evil.  It’s just that a lot of money can make us feel pretty self-sufficient and even isolated from the rest of the world: be it behind a gated community, tinted glass, within our airconditioning or central heating.  If we are not careful, we find ourselves isolated from the normal lives needs of other human beings.  Money isn’t bad; but it can sure make us feel self-sufficient, secure and independent.  We can quickly loose track of our essential humanness.  Of that fact that God did not create us to be alone.  That God calls us into community, over and over again, to learn how to be inter-dependent upon one another.  \\n\\tApparently, according to the author of Hebrews, reading the Word of God can be risky.   God knows you and I each need daily spiritual surgery; so much gets in the way of our relationships with God and one another.  Hearing the Word of God from Jesus’ lips was certainly an unexpected challenge for the rich man.  I give thanks that the Risen Jesus has experienced life as he know it.  And that he continues to meet us in our places of weakness and brokenness.  Thanks be to God that we can “approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThis is our 4th Sunday of studying together the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples. And we have finally arrived at “And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.”   Wait a minute….is that right?  Take a look at the front page of the bulletin.  Fourth line down on the quote from Matthew: “And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtor.”  Hmmmmm?  But hold on, look at third line in Luke right underneath: “And forgive us our sins, for we forgives everyone indebted to us.”  Jump back up to Matthew, near the end:  “For I you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.”  And, if that isn’t confusing enough, if you happened to bring a translation different from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible this morning, it may have a different translation of this phrase.  What is going on here?  To me this raises some challenging questions about the authority of scripture: if one is to take the scripture literally, which version do you choose?  Debts, trespasses, sins…what’s the difference?   There is actually quite a bit of different, but I’ll get to that in a moment.   \\nFor those of our lay leaders who have been in on some of Church Council discussions over the last year and ahalf of my time with here as interim pastor, you will recognize this part of the prayer has become problematic among us.  Apparently there had been along history of saying “trespasses” in the Lord’s prayer at Immanuel.  But at some point in her tenure the previous Pastor chose to change this to “sins.”  To me, this raises some important questions about the role and authority of the pastor, and how pastor and congregation work together to not just run the church, but to design and order the worship that binds them together.   For some this change was quite an affront and others did not seem to have a problem with it.  Whether there was discussion with the Pastor during this change or after people sat with it for awhile, I really don’t know.  All this raises some important questions about how a congregation and a Pastor work collaboratively together:  How might they all give each other more honest and direct feedback in their ministry together?   And when there is a problem in our ministry together….like a trespass or a indebtedness or a sin….how do congregation and Pastor acknowledge it, make amends, forgive, and move on?  \\nWhich brings us back to today’s focus:  Forgiveness has to do with how we co-exist with the past where mistakes have been made, how the past dwells in our memory and heart.   This part of the Lord’s Prayer deals with the messiness of life, or put theologically, our sinfulness.  Times when through human actions things get out of balance, people get hurt, and life seems unfair. All of us are sinful and all of us need God’s forgiveness.   \\n\\tJesus also taught that our sinfulness against God, our resistance to God, puts us in debt to God, in a very real sense.  It is a debt that we just can’t pay back.  We all have to fall on God’s mercy. The Gospel of Matthew picks up on this notion by using the words “debts” in his record of the prayer, which is how it is prayed in some congregations.  Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  Apparently, it is pretty bad form to soak in God’s mercy and acceptance while continuing to be an unforgiving person.  Some Biblical scholars note that “debts” may come closest to Jesus’ original words.  Jesus’ original audience was mostly devout Jews. They would hear “debt” and remember the stories of the release from debt-slavery in Egypt.  They would remember the teachings from Deuteronomy we read this morning:  There was to be a rhythm of every seven years of release from debt.  Just like the rhythm of releasing your land from plantings by letting them lay fallow, debts should be forgiven and slaves were to be released.  The reminder was always this:  Pharoh’s Egypt was not just, the Israelites, the people of God were not to become another Egypt.  Could “forgive us our debts as we forgives our debtors” have to do with our part in the Kingdom of God, the Household of God?  Make sure there is enough for everyone in God’s House and not too much debt weighing people down? \\nThe disciple Peter wondered how often we have to forgive someone who has offended or hurt us.  Probably thinking he sounded generous, Peter asked Jesus  “should we forgive someone up to 7 times?”  “Not seven times, but, I tell you, 77 times” replies Jesus.  And after giving this absurdly high number, And then he proceeds to tell a story about debts: literal money debt. And it is a dire story of a harsh king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.  After much pleading, one heavily in-debt slave is finally forgiven his debt (the equivalent of about $25 million) by the relenting king.  But then this slave has the audacity to turn around and imprison a fellow slave who owes him a small amount of money (the equivalent of about $50).  His fellow slaves are understandably distressed by this double-standard and inform the king.  Infuriated, the king orders the slave tortured until he presents the money he is concealing and repays his entire debt.  The story ends rather ominously with Jesus suggesting that God will do this to us if we do not forgive our brothers and sisters from our hearts. \\n\\tSeveral years ago, a church member pressed upon me a copy a novel called The Shack, by William P. Young.  It turned out to be an unsettling yet compelling story of a man who, I’m not sure how else to describe this, “meets God.”  His life is miserable, as he is trying to cope with the kidnapping and apparent murder of his young daughter.  Several years after the girl’s disappearance, the distraught and grieving father receives an anonymous summons to travel to an abandoned wilderness cabin related to his daughter’s abduction.  Cautious and curious, there he has an astounding encounter with…..well, as odd as this may sound…..the three persons of the Holy Trinity.  Whether this is in a dream or in an altered state or happens in real time, the reader doesn’t quite know.  But God in three persons shows up as an old African American woman called Papa, a youngish male carpenter called Jesus and a strangely vibrant and somewhat transparent female apparition who is the Spirit.  They talk with the man, they eat meals together, they sing, they walk around, they talk and eat some more.  Much of their discussion is about forgiveness, which, as you may well imagine, does not sit well with this overwhelmed parent who would happily kill the man who murdered his daughter.  At one point the Jesus figure says to the angry father:  “Forgiveness is not about forgetting.  It is about letting go of another persons’ throat.”  I was struck by this image of having both of my hands around someone’s’ throat, even if it is only in my imagination.  Both hands are busy with hanging on, and not available for much else.  The letting-go, the releasing, opens up some space inside of us.  This space seems inextricably connected, according to Jesus, with our ability to engage in God’s forgiveness of us.  \\t  \\n\\tThe invitation to forgiveness is perhaps an invitation to look at what is most difficult in our lives, sometimes the most frightening: the reality of a child’s murder, the memories of hurts and transgressions.   Here’s Jesus vision: My stranglehold on grudges and resentment can be released and my own forgiveness receptors opened.  Mercy and love can flow in and out.   Jesus had an unique way of recognizing this:  if I have had a falling out with my fellow human, and have not cleaned it up, I am going to have trouble connecting with God.  Not because God rejects me, but I’m not in much of a receiving mode.  My own unforgiving attitude blocks the channel of forgiveness.  My hands are still around that person’s throat.  My hands (and heart) are not open and available to join with God’s, nor are they really available to help anyone else.   \\n\\tForgiveness not only frees our hands up, it helps us recover our energies and our personal power, our integrity.   “Pray like this,” said Jesus:  “Forgive us our debts, our trespasses, our sins,  as we forgive our debtors, those who trespass, sin against us.”  This is our prayer, as followers of Jesus.  This is the promise and our hope.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n“Once to every man and nation.”  And once to every woman and nation, I would add.  In spite of its gender exclusive title, this hymn by James Russell Lowell never fails to stir and challenge me.  This 19th century poet, editor and diplomat was the son of a Congregational minister.  Lowell was also an active abolitionist, working with his wife Maria White in the New England anti-slavery movement.  Our hymn is part of a longer poem called “The Present Crisis,” which Lowell published the poem in Boston in 1845, as a protest against US involvement in the war with Mexico. Lowell was convinced that land added to Texas would only increase the territory of permitted slavery. After a portion of the poem was set to music, it was often sung in many New England Congregational churches which felt called to anti-slavery work. “Once to every man, woman and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side.”  These denominational ancestors of our United Church of Christ believed that the prevailing supposed “truth” of black people’s inherent inferiority to white people was a “falsehood.”  For them, “time (had truly) made ancient good uncouth.”  \\nSING THE SECOND VERSE TOGETHER…..\\nThe tone of the hymn is somber, even gruesome at times: we walk a path “by light of burning martyrs,” tracking “Jesus’ bleeding feet.”  Yet, I experience an odd mixture of feeling both chastened and hopeful as I sing the words, convicted again and again by the phrase, “new occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.” \\nAs a congregation, we are at an interesting confluence of “new occasions.”  Part of our visioning process is figuring out just what are these “new occasions” that surround us in the community.  What is it about this growing disparity between the rich and the poor in our part of Fairfax County?  How can so many working people be struggling to feed their families?  In this continually transient area, how do busy two career families find a sense of community and belonging?  How do all the young single professionals pouring into the Tysons area find an intergenerational tribe that will welcome and help feed their spiritual hunger, especially when they are so understandably leary of organized religion?  In response to these “new occasions” what “new duties” are being revealed to us as disciples of Jesus?  \\nTomorrow, we again have the opportunity to reflect on the prophetic life and ministry of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  As we pause and listen, we may well be challenged to focus again on the realities of poverty, racism and war that Dr. King so boldy preached about in the 1960’s, and that continue to plague our life together.  I learned recently that even though it has been nearly 60 years since the “U.S. Supreme Court overturned a ‘separate but equal’ doctrine that reinformced segregation, almost a quarter of Americans say it is OK for races to be separate as long as they have equal opportunities.”  This and other findings of the recently released Rice University “2012 Portraits of American Life Study” indicate a “growing gap in racial attitudes and experiences in America.”  An article in this week’s Christian Century Magazine (January 22, 2014, p. 15-16), describes how this major six year study explored the impact of religion on everyday life in the US, asking the same questions about ethnic and religious diversity to the same diverse group of people in 2006 and 2012.  What has changed? the researchers asked.  Apparently, we are “a land of two Americas divided by race and less willing than ever to find a common ground of understanding.”  The study reveals that  “perceived racial injustice rose for both whites and blacks in between 2006 and 2012.  The percentage of whites who said they had been treated unfairly because of their race in the last 3 years rose from 8 percent in 06 to 14 percent in ’12.  The percentage of blacks reporting prejudice rose from 36 percent to 46 percent in that same time period.”  45 percent of white respondents in 2006 said “one of the most effective ways to improve race relations was to stop talking about race.  In 2012, that figure rose to 59 percent who wanted to stop talking about race.”    What is the “new occasion” we find ourselves in as celebrate Dr. King’s birthday this year?  It seems that more and more people just want to stop talking about race.   \\n\\tKarl Barth, the 20th century German Protestant theologian, used to say that preachers must write their sermons holding the daily newspaper in one hand and the Bible in the other.  We may receive our news through a different medium today: radio, TV, internet, tweets.  But however we learn about the emerging “new occasions” around us, Barth’s words still hold.  This dialogue between the realities of the present world and the ancient wisdom of our holy text is a good practice for any follower of Jesus.  This dialogue helps us get more clear about Jesus’ invitation to follow him.  So, today I lift up this Portraits of American Life Study in one hand, and in the other - our Epiphany texts from scripture which bring us a epiphany snapshot, a perspective on the revealing of Jesus’ identity.  Let’s turn to this text from the Gospel of John. \\n\\tWhile he does not describe Jesus’ baptism directly, the gospel writer John reports that John the Baptiszer publicly acknowledges Jesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world!”   Some Christians interpret this as meaning that Jesus, in his death, will become the divine sacrifice for human sin.  As I studied this text this week, I discovered that in Jesus time, lambs were not regularly used in Jewish Temple sacrifices for individual sins.   Lambs were used solely during the Passover celebration, when the Jewish people would remember the liberation and deliverance of their people from slavery in Egypt.  Is the gospel writer John wanting us to know that Jesus is to be the one to show people how not to be slaves?  Not just slave to their own sins but as slaves to their oppressors and to their living as outcasts in their communities.  In his relationships with people, Jesus will show all kinds of troubled, hurting and marginalized folks how to experience the freedom of forgiveness, to transform both their behavior and lives of those around them.  He will also push communities to welcome these people back from the margins, into full fellowship among them.  Two of the Baptizer’s disciples hear John the Baptist exclaim, “look here is the Lamb of God” and the two men are intrigued; they start to walk after Jesus.  Jesus senses them there, turns and asks:  “What are you looking for?”  Jesus certainly gets right to the point.  “What do you really want? Jesus might ask of each of us: “What are you looking for?”   Such a pointed question.  It’s almost scarey to ask it of ourselves.  What are we looking for? An end to all this discussion about race so we can then truly live in the post-racial society that we dream about?   I don’t think that is how we get there.   After the verdict in the Trayvon Martin murder case, I suggested that we might read together The New Jim Crow:  Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, by Michelle Alexander.  My offer still stands.  Stopping the discussion doesn’t make something change.  \\n\\t“What are you looking for?” Jesus asks the two men who approach him.  It’s a question about change, isn’t it?  What do you want to change?  The men make a curious reply: “Rabbi, teacher, where are you staying?”  They actually ask him “where are you abiding, remaining” – it’s almost like they asked for his address!  “Give us something, someplace, that we can identify you by!” or “who the heck ARE you?!”   And Jesus replies, “come and see.”  Not “come and take a look” ,but come and “see” as in “experience,” or “recognize.”   \\nWhat is Jesus inviting them to?  To experience, recognize, that the Kingdom of God is at hand.  God’s reign, where the first shall be last and the last shall be first, is at hand.  Where the poor will be fed and the captives released and the blind will see and the lame walk.  Where people can be changed, transformed into disciples who share God’s love for the world. \\n\\t “New occasion bring new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth. Standeth God within the shadow keeping watch above his own.”  This God of ours not only keeps watch, but continually tries to get our attention.  This God is calling each of us to new duties, as we become transformed by the presence of the Spirit of the Risen Jesus in our lives.  What new visions and new calls will emerge for each of us in these coming months?  For this congregation?  Let’s be in conversation together.  “Come and see,” says Jesus.  Amen. \\n\\nI invite you to remain seated and to join with me in singing this final verse together, followed by some time of silent reflection.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThere is a unspoken agreement among most ministers: We think that Jesus had it easy.  This may sound rather startling, or even presumptuous.  But when you get a bunch of clergy-types together, and they invariably start talking about the ups and downs of leading local congregations, Jesus’ everyday ministerial duties look pretty appealing. As an itinerant preacher/teacher/healer, he had a new group of people to talk with every few days, no budgets to debate, no buildings to repair, no difficult Board meetings.  And think of it: no hospital visits because you cure people on the spot!  There were certainly times when Jesus was drained and physically exhausted from his ministry.  But what is missing in Jesus’ work is this very human and fallible institution as we know it today, called “the church.”   Hmmmm,  we ministers think to ourselves….maybe we should all just get spiritual and leave this religious institution stuff behind us!  \\n\\tBut then, darn it, I start reading the Bible again and I am reminded of the great cloud of witnesses that have gone on before us, and the communities of alive people that I am drawn to.  And I remember that it is all about people sharing this experience of the living God with one another and struggling to create ways to live out that experience together.  I read Luke’s account of Jesus’ private spiritual encounter in the desert, filled with temptations to power and glory.  But I am sharply reminded that he doesn’t keep this personal encounter with the divine to himself.  In our text today, Jesus has already returned to his hometown, joining his family and neighbors in worship at their local synagogue.   The time of prayers, singing and Hebrew scripture would have been lay led, with the community’s men stepping forward to read from the scrolls.  Jesus stands and is handed the reading for the day, this portion from the prophet Isaiah:  \\n\\tThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.\\n\\tBy this time in Jewish tradition, these words had been connected to the community’s expectation of the Messiah who would come and transform Israel.  After he has finished reading, Jesus sits down among them.  Without him saying a word more, people know something is up.  All eyes are fixed on him.  From where he is seated, Jesus simply says: Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.  Sounds rather innocuous to us perhaps, but after a few moments, all hell breaks loose.  Jesus starts describing how freeing and healing people is going to challenge the community’s insider status and their neglect of the marginalized in their midst.   And as we will read next week, those in the synagogue are so scandalized by his words that they will chase out of his hometown and try to throw him over a cliff.  Yet another religious institutions at its worst; let’s just be spiritual, okay?\\n\\tOne Biblical commentator on this passages suggests: Note that Jesus reads from their own (his own) Scriptures, which is to suggest that the Bible is both the greatest friend and the greatest enemy of the community of faith. Everything that would challenge us most deeply is right here, right there, in this odd, disordered and difficult book, a book that reads us as much as we read it.  (Anthony Robinson, 1/27/13 lectionary web-blog).\\n\\tPart of what happens to us in religious community is that we allow something bigger than ourselves “reads us.”  Something wider than our own individual insight, even larger than our own collective perspective as a group.  We allow the faith tradition, other congregations, a wider denomination, and a very old book called the Bible, to “read us as much as we read it.”   The Bible becomes both “friend and enemy” to us as individuals and to us as a congregation.  Because the Biblical message has this tenacious way of fulfilling itself as we hear it.  It works in us, if we let it.  \\n\\tTake this passage from the apostle Paul we just heard; a snippet of a letter that he wrote to one of the congregations he started in southern Greece around the middle of the first century.  Having encountered the risen Jesus Christ in a vision, this Greek-speaking Jewish Pharisee gets busy spreading the Good News of new life through the Spirit.  This church in the busy, prosperous and diverse city of Corinth is apparently growing and is filled with conflict.  Groups of people, from various ethnic backgrounds and social classes in the city, would come together regularly in one of their larger homes, for a common meal and worship.   At this point, the word church, or in Greek ekklesia, means simply “a people called” or “the visible assembly.”  It’s about the community for them, the people who are responding to God’s call in Jesus Christ.   And apparently, this “visible assembly” was a mess.  Grumbling and infighting, rival groups trying to gain control.  A reluctance to hold some people accountable for flagrant immorality.  And the less prominent among them, those of lesser means, had been marginalized and ignored.  \\n\\tGood gracious, we might wonder.  If the early church got in trouble so quickly, is that just the way it is going to be for churches?  What does it mean to “be church” in this day and age, when so much church history, and people’s experiences in congregations, can be so difficult?  A good question to consider in light of our Annual Meeting today, when we reflect on this last year and look forward into the next.       \\n\\t\\tHere is where I find the Bible reading me, reading us, today:  here in Paul’s image of the church as the Body of Christ.  In ancient times, the image of the corporate Body was often used to substantiate hierarchies and establish the lowliness of certain classes of people.  But Paul uses the body metaphor to decribe our equality and unity “in Christ” as a follower of the Risen Jesus, and the necessity of all of us for the work of the Gospel.  There can be some comfort in this, as we sink into the love and support of a community.  But this is also incredibly challenging, given our predominant cultural notions of rugged individualism.  In being church together, “the Body of Christ,” we are admitting a communal dependence, bearing each other’s joys and sufferings.  We are fulfilling God’s vision for humanity by hanging in there together.   We are not God’s sons and daughters alone.  This is where “spiritual but not religious” just doesn’t cut it for me.  I don’t follow Jesus by myself, just from my own individual perspective and experience.  As Lillian Daniel, United Church of Christ minister of a church outside of Chicago has written in her new book “When Spiritual But not Religious Isn’t Enough.”  Church, Daniel describes, is where we “step out of ourselves, dare to become a community, and encounter a God greater than we could ever invent.”\\n              A club of people is connected to one another because of a shared\\nsense of preferences, which develop a common purpose and shared tasks.   But a church community is connected together in a different way.  We all have different preferences, because any church is invariably filled with different kinds of people, some of whom we might not naturally rub shoulders with in our weekday world.   It’s our unity in diversity that is so important, and such a powerful witness to the world.  We are drawn together as we experience in worship, fellowship and service, the welcome of other humans and God’s extravagant welcome of us.  In that welcome, by the gathered Body of Christ, we slowly begin to experience the transforming power of God.  Self-judgment and competition softens, we let down our armor a bit, and we start to connect.    \\n\\t\\tThis community is where all of us, the weak and the strong alike, come week after week to get re-oriented, re-formed, given fresh eyes to see God’s world.  Where we develop the perspective and the renewed energy to go out and be part of the freeing and healing of the world around us.  And so it is for us, the Body of Christ.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tChrist is Risen indeed.  I wonder how this proclamation sits with each of us gathered here on this particular Easter morning.  Is it good news, to which you respond with a hearty AMEN?  Christ is Risen. Does this proclamation intrigue and mystify you….make you wonder “okay what’s the big deal.”  Christ is Risen. Alleluia?  Does it grate a bit, set you teeth on edge, because it sounds just too…..well, let’s be blunt: Christian triumphalism that puts down all other religions?  Christ is Risen.   Does it hit you as a preposterous statement that grates against scientific analysis and good common sense?  Christ is Risen indeed.\\n\\tA number of years ago, I was at casual dinner party with some old and new friends, the night before Easter.  None of these people around the table were church goers as adults. Today we would label them “nones” (N-O-N-E-S as in “none of the religions on this survey apply to me”); those who may well describe themselves as being “spiritual” but not specifically religious. As we were talking over dessert, one of them turned to me and remarked:  “Well, this Sunday is your Big Day, isn’t it?”  I half-smiled and half-groaned, nodding yes.  My friend leaned back and asked with studied casualness: “now just what IS Easter, anyway?  Jesus gets resurrected?”  I could tell he was half baiting me, and half serious. \\n\\tI was debating in my head how much of a theological discourse or personal testimony to give my non-religious but somewhat spiritual friend’s question: “now just what is Easter anyway?”  Suddenly, I heard myself answer, “yes, we celebrate his resurrection…”  I paused and added:  “his empty tomb, his being alive, means death is not the final word.”  “Hmmm,” replied my friend, taking another sip of wine…but looking suddenly sobered and somewhat mystified.    \\n\\tThere was something so blunt, so illogical, even brazen about my answer, that I felt awkward in the silence that followed.  After a few formative years within more evangelical circles in my early twenties, I had grown leery of blatant proselytizing.  I was also aware that this inquisitive acquaintance may have been hoping to pigeon-hole me as a judgmental, rigid and dismissible type of Christian by my answer, figuring I might say something along the line of:  “Jesus is resurrected and if we believe this then we go to heaven….and you don’t.”  But I don’t believe that is what Easter is about.  For me, in my unguarded dinner table moment, I realized that it is this challenging of the power of death itself that was, and still is, the most incredible part of the Easter claim for me. The tomb was empty and that, paradoxically, means new life.   Something dead is now alive.  Not a resussitated body; but this man who embodied God’s radically inclusive unstoppably love was dead…and has been transformed into a living entity.  And for several millennium, Christians have been saying much the same thing: we testify to this ongoing presence of the Risen Christ in our midst, and it is making new life possible in us.   \\n\\tAnd there IS something almost embarrassing about this claim, in part because our best thinking can’t quite comprehend it.  Feeling dead inside, and death itself, is not the last word.  This is grown-up stuff, beyond spring bunnies and chocolate eggs.  It’s the stuff of Antonio Machado’s poem about his dream:  a idea so paradoxical it has to come to him under the cover of sleep, when his conscious brain is no longer in charge.  “A spring breaking out in my heart?” A beehive in my heart with floating golden bees making beeswax and honey out of my mistakes, my failures, my deadness?  “Marvelous error,” Machado cries, over and over.  This can’t be right.  How can it be that these changes come to me, he asks.  I dreamt I had a firery sun giving light inside my heart.  That’s crazy!  “Last night, as I slept I dreamt, marvelous error, that it was God I had here in my heart.”  The spirit of the living God, inside of our hearts.  “Fear not,” said Jesus at his last meal with his followers, “I will be with you always.”\\n\\tCan dry hearts be replenished and warmed?  Can old failures be transformed?  Sometimes we get so caught up in the calculated logic of the world and what our conscious ego analizes might be possible.  “I just can’t let go of that resentment, that disappointment, that mistake.”  We miss the possibility of our own inner healing and changing.   I often liken Easter morning to a cold glass of water – thrown in my face!  Because there has always been something too sudden, too bizarre about Easter.   Jesus is killed because he embodied God’s radically inclusive love so totally, that he became a threat to just about everyone.  Again and again, he refused to compromise; he would not set limits on God’s unstoppable love, forgiveness and acceptance.  \\n\\tThe Gospel of John tells us that Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb first, which is a rather remarkable account given how patriarchal and repressive of women the Christian church will later become.  We follow this grieving and unnerved woman as she stumbles through the early darkness, coming to dress the body of her beloved Teacher for burial.   The other followers are in hiding; surely the Romans will be looking for them too.  Mary finds an empty burial tomb and runs to get several of the other disciples.  Returning, she encounters an angelic beings who question her.  She suddenly senses someone behind her.  Turning, she asks the unfamiliar figure: “uh, excuse me, but do you know where they have taken the body?”  But it is the Risen Jesus - unrecognizable, then incomprehensible – oh my God, Teacher, it is you!  He calls her by name: Mary.  In that moment,  she recognizes him.  And I wonder if in that moment, she recognizes herself.   She is not just a woman frantically bereaved, torn from the person who embodied Gods’ radically inclusive love.  She is Mary, beloved disciple and forgiven one, a woman who came to see her old failures transformed.  One who became a close student and even confidant to Jesus, who came to know and accept her own precious self through her relationship with this Teacher and friend.  She hurtles back down the path, scarcely comprehending what she has just experienced and what she did NOT see there at the tomb.  Looking for a dead body, finding emptiness, turning to see new life and hearing her name called.  Mary gets it.  Jesus is now present in a new and different way; life and God’s love is unstoppable.\\n\\tOn this holy day, I cannot just preach that Jesus’ teachings are immortal, or that his spirit simply lives on in the memories of his followers, because I do not believe that this is whole truth.  Yet the whole truth is unsettling; a part of me resists taking it seriously, given the implications about the unpredictable, intrusive, mysterious side of God’s redemptive love.  Our adult live is are full of self-doubts, and often a casual flippancy about what really matters.  It sometimes feels more natural to say that death does have the last word, as we are confronted again by sudden illness, missed opportunities, friends who fail us, more violence around the globe, or the untimely death of a loved one.\\nYet we each yearn for a deeper sense of connection with the great Mystery around us, with the well-spring of renewal and hope.  Water for our dryness, heat for our chill, light for our darkness.  For old failures to be changed into sweet honey.  We are hungry to be called us by name and re-called to our own precious selves. \\n\\tEaster poses the grown-up question:  “just how do I want to live the rest of my days?  Dying or living?”  Following Jesus has never been a religion of cozy pieties; it’s an invitation to be alive, in ways we never thought possible.  Jesus is standing before us again, as he stood before Mary Magdalene on that garden path.  He is addressing each of us by name:  “Anne, here I am – I’m alive – my spirit now lives inside of you, it’s changing you in this very moment.  Now, what will be transformed in your life?”\\n\\tChrist has risen.  Christ is risen indeed.  Alleluia and Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tThroughout the soaring stone edifice of the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, there are numerous statues of Biblical figures and saints of the Catholic Church.  But as I sat there last light, immersed in the haunting choral music of the National Lutheran Choir, my eyes keep drifting to the statute of Mary which stands high above the huge altar in the chancel area.  Her stone head bent, eyes lowered and arms slightly extended, she seemed to quietly gaze down over us.  Who is she for all of us Protestants in this room, I thought?  Who is Mary, the mother of Jesus, for me? \\n\\nI occasionally worshipped at a Catholic Church with my friends when I was young. The stained glass, shadowy depths, and flickering candles were all quite a contrast to the clear glass windows, bare white walls and plain altar of my Congregational Church upbringing.  Who was that blue robed lady statue up near the altar?  My Catholic friends’ had prayer cards with this lady’s picture on it; her name was “The Virgin.”  I wasn’t sure exactly what a “virgin” was.  Eventually I pieced together that the Mary in our little French crèche scene at home, Jesus’ mother, was the same person as the huge, solemn looking lady in blue at the Catholic Church.   I wondered why Mary, except for the annual Christmas pageant, never came to our Protestant church.  \\n\\nThe Biblical references to Mary are amazingly few, given the eventual development of devotion to her and church doctrine about her.   Of all accounts of Jesus’ life and ministry, only the later gospel writers, Matthew and Luke, speak of Mary’s role in Jesus birth and claim that she was a young, unmarried virgin.  The whole rest of the New Testament, Paul’s letters and those of other early church missionaries recorded in the Book of Acts, and the gospel writers Mark and John – none of them mention a virgin birth.   Miraculous births were quite common in the mythology of both the Greeks and the Romans.  But this belief about Mary was either unknown or simply not relevant to the earliest Christian writers, which I frankly find to be a relief.  I have known far too many people throughout my ministry who were turned off to the transformative power of the Christian message by the assumption that they had to believe in the virgin birth.  \\n\\nI would be curious to learn how is it for each of you, when Mary steps on the stage of the Gospel story each Advent?   What do you make of her?  We encounter her today as a young girl, barely pubescent, but in line with the customs of her time, engaged to a man probably older than her.  In Luke’s text, she is described as being “perplexed “ when an angel greets her as a “favored one” and brings her this an astounding announcement.   While Matthew has this news come to Joseph in a dream, it is Luke who unfolds the full narrative of Mary’s encounter with the divine: not only will she conceive by the Holy Spirit, but her child will be “called the Son of the Most High…and will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”  “How can this be?” Mary asks the angel in surprise, and we might ask the same question.  I wonder if Mary was reacting less to the news of “immaculate” conception and more to this idea of the coming of the Son of the Most High who would initiate God’s reign of compassion, salvation and hope. \\n\\t\\n\\tFor years I have been fascinated by how Western artists have depicted the angel Gabriel appearing to Mary.  Since the Middle Ages, rich and complex paintings of the Annunciation have been popular themes and teaching lessons about the virtues of purity and obedience.  As I looked at reproductions of some of these more famous paintings again this week, I couldn’t help but notice that so many of them show Mary in a startled and even defensive position.  An early medieval painting by Simone Martini has her pulling her cloak close around her neck and frowning at the angel.  The Italian painter, Fra Angelico, has Mary calmly meeting the angel’s gaze, but with both her arms protectively covering her mid section.   The Spaniard El Greco seats Mary in an wildly apocalyptic looking scene, under dark, swirling clouds; her pale, mournful pale face and upraised hands push away the imposing angel.  Rembrandts’ pen and ink drawing has her almost shrouded by the angels huge wing; and with an overwhelmed look on her face, Mary leans away, again with the arms up protectively.  “Please Go Away” the Mary in each scene seems to say.  Leonardo da Vinci’s Mary appears interrupted in the middle of reading a book; she has a calm, intent expression as she watches the angel but holds her left hand up in what looks like the gesture for “halt!”  From the Netherlands, van Eyck paints her as looking away from the angel and with her hands thrown up in what has to be the universal stance for “What Ever!” \\n\\nThese paintings have brought many people much joy and inspiration.  I simply find it curious that these depictions of Mary just didn’t seem to illustrate this scene we read in Luke.  The artists’ Marys seem shocked and harried, or defensive, reluctant, somber; they are often sad.  Luke’s Mary seems otherwise to me.  \\n\\nIt wasn’t until I stumbled upon the American painter, Henry O. Tanner’s Annunciation that it occurred to me what seemed so odd about all the other pieces I reviewed.  It is lesser known, but perhaps you have seen it and can call it to mind.  I have put a copy of it on the candlelit table display in our church lobby. Painted in 1898, Tanner’s Annunciation depicts a simple scene of a young woman in a bare, first century Palestinian home. The room is hung with a plain tapestry of muted browns, ochre.  Mary is sitting on a bed-like couch covered with rumpled blankets.  Following her gaze as she looks off to the left of the painting, all we see of the angel is a golden, shimmering shaft of light.  No halo, no wings, no face.  Just golden light.  Mary’s face is flooded with the reflected radiance, her eyes are wide with concentration, and she appears to be listening intently with her head forward.  In stark contrast with the bracing, flailing, defensive posture of Mary in so many of the other Annunciation paintings, here her hands are folded quietly on her knees.  Not in her lap, primly like an obedient and passive child.  But as she leans forward to look and listen; her hands are calmly folded and resting on her knees.   She appears intent, a bit perplexed yes, yet she is clearly pondering at the same time, just as Luke describes.   She is being engaged, not terrified, by the angelic being.\\n\\nMary’s positioning and countenance in the Tanner painting reminded me of Denise Levertov’s poem, “Annunciation.”   I have put some copies of this poem next to the Tanner reprint, which you make take with you today. The poem begins with oblique references to the images we know from so many of these Annunciation paintings, with their symbolism of lilies for purity and period settings.  But Levertov brings Mary back down to our human level, and we are invited to consider how God might encounter, might annunciate, to each of us.  How might we each move from “how can this be?” to “here I am, a servant of the Lord.”  Levertov writes:\\n\\nCalled to a destiny more momentous than any in all of Time, she did not quail, only asked a simple, “How can this be?”  And gravely, courteously, took to heart the angel’s reply, perceiving instantly the astounding ministry she was offered.\\n\\nAgain and again the Gospel writer Luke reminds us that God is working with unusual characters to bring about God’s realm on Earth. Lowly people like young girls and tax collectors, people who are sick or deformed, prostitutes and blind people, possessed people and foreigners and other outcasts.  Insignificant Mary embraces God’s call to be part of that work.  She doesn’t say, “oh I’m too young, too inexperienced, too busy.”  She willingly takes on the burden of being pregnant and stigmatized.\\n\\nI don’t see Mary as a model of sexual purity that I must emulate.  I don’t think she is a model for motherly achievement that is the only proof of a woman’s worthiness.  Mary will go on to be one of adult Jesus’ early and most faithful disciples; she remains with him at his death and is an active part of the early Christian community proclaiming his resurrection and ongoing presence.   As a young woman, Mary had the gumption to believe that God had chosen her for important work, and she had the courage to respond, trusting both God and herself.  Luke describes her traveling alone out to visit her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist.  He describes Mary rejoicing in the role, which has been entrusted to her.  I suspect this story survived not so we emulate her virginity or even her motherhood; we are to follow her model of trusting, courageous discipleship.  Faithful discipleship as a follower of adult Jesus; this is Mary’s witness.\\n\\nGod has daily ministries of bravery and hope for each of each of us and for the life of this congregation.   “How can this be?” we might find wonder.  It is because God seeks to use each of us, and we yearn to partner with God in this work.   So we listen and we ponder carefully.  We lean forward into these choices, as God’s annunciations come, keeping a steady gaze and calm hands.  Our consent will illumine us.  And we will shine as God’s lights in the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'As I read McClaren further, it began to dawn on me why we need Herod may need to stay the birth story: “The baby whom Herod seeks to kill”, writes McClaren, “will model another way. (Jesus) tool will be service, not violence. And his goal will not be gaining and maintaining power, but using his power to heal and empower others. He will reveal a vision of God that is reflected more in the vulnerability of children than in the violence of men, more in the caring of mothers than in the cruelty of kings.” \\n\\tWhat I find most compelling about McLaren’s analysis is how he pushes deeper, past the theoretical and out into our probable future as a nation.  He continues: “(Our) next war – whoever wages it – will most likely resemble every war in the past. It will be planned by powerful older men in their comfortable offices, and it will be fought on the ground by people the age of their children and grand children. Most of the [uniformed] casualties will probably be between eighteen and twenty-two years old – in some places, much younger. So the old, sad music of the ancient story of Herod and the slaughter of the children will be replayed again. And again, the tears of mothers will fall.”[9]   Yikes.  This is harsh stuff.  The whole Herod piece is harsh.  And we need to hear it.\\n\\tMcClaren presses on by suggesting that this Herod piece makes us think about how we imagine God’s job, what God does in the world.   “Does God promote or demand violence?” He asks.  “Does God favor the sacrifice of children for the well-being of adults? Is God best reflected in the image of powerful old men who send the young and vulnerable to die on their behalf? Or is God best seen in the image of a helpless baby, identifying with the victims, sharing their vulnerability, full of fragile but limitless promise?”[10]  I find this to be challenging stuff.\\n\\tI believe in the coming year we will be asked, more and more, to side with those who are vulnerable.  It may be people in the LBGTQ community who loose the right not to be discriminated against in their jobs or housing.  We may need to side with women made more vulnerable physically by the loss of reproductive health care.  It may be immigrant families more likely to being harassed or deported.  How will we side with be Muslim individuals, with kids who go to school right down the street, who become suspect, tracked, questioned, restricted….  How will we side with our vulnerable and endangered environment  increasingly vulnerable, as the scientific facts regarding climate change are ignored and earth-protecting laws are repealed? \\n\\tWe claim that God comes close to our own needs and vulnerabilities in a new way in Jesus….this child of both heaven and earth.  How will we come close to the vulnerabilities of others in this new year?   “To walk the road with Jesus,” writes Clarenden, “is to withhold consent and cooperation with the powerful, and to invest it instead with the vulnerable.”  How might we as individuals, as a church, invest our consent and cooperation with the vulnerable?  Much to ponder, as we settle in with the presence of Jesus Christ in our midst.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n\\nBrian McLaren,\\xa0We Make the Road by Walking, chapter 16, page 71-74.  \\nJeffrey Spenser, “Keeping Herod in Christmas” – Niles Fremont UCC Church, Fremont, CA, December 2016.',\n",
       " '\\tIn the first 11 chapters of Genesis we get a panoramic perspective of the whole of God’s creation on earth.  From the creation stories to the Garden of Eden to Cain killing Abel to basically on-going mayhem all over the planet, this first section symbolically describes what a mess humans make of God’s creation.  After the ultimate clean-up strategy of the flood story, God is portrayed as pretty much giving up on the “curses and punishment” approach to dealing with these creative but violent beings who keep abusing the gift of free will. \\n\\tThe narrative then narrows things down by focusing on the descendants of Shem, one of Noah’s sons.  The Biblical writers would want us to know that God is on to a new strategy of mending this broken universe God has created.  God focuses in on one group of people, rather randomly it would seem, to do a bold new thing. Against a background of broken, divided and violent humanity, God will bless this man and his descents, and make of them a great nation.  Why?  These folks are not particularly special or God.  God is simply deeply invested in this human enterprise.  God now invites a particular people to be a blessing to the rest of the world through the way that they will live.  \\n\\tThe Sumarian gods and goddesses of Abram’s time offered individual blessings of fertility and prosperous living.  This was something different.  Abram and his descendents were being offered co-creatorship; the invitation to engage in a communal ethic that would promote justice and mercy as an example and blessing to the world.  But only, and here is the catch, only if Abram is willing to take a risk: to leave the ties of kinship in his nomadic community that assured his identity, economic well-being and physical security.  Said God to Abram: You are going to need to trust me.  I’m not going to be specific about where you and your immediate family are headed. Leave your securities and I will show you, on a need to know basis.  You are going to have to take a risk here.   New life entails risk.  What risks are you and I willing to take these days, when we sense a call to new life?  Especially collectively, in an era where we are being told our identity, our economic well-being, our physical security depends on pulling in, building walls, hunkering down?  When we are told to reject families who head out into the uncertain future and become sojourners in our midst, like Abram and his wife Sarai?\\t\\n\\tFast forward thousand of years to what will become this couples’ descendents: Jews of all different perspectives and practices, living under Roman rule in and around Jerusalem in the early first century CE.  They have come a long way as a nation, times of peace and prosperity, enduring foreign domination, exile, return to rebuild…..and now the repressive Roman occupation.  The insidious presence of an imperial culture that demanded taxes, military conscription, and appalingly, worship of their Emperor Augustus.  Jews throughout the region struggled with what it meant to constancy live among and beholden to this occupying enemy. \\n\\tThe Pharisees of the day were the legal scholars, the rabbis who helped people interpret the Jewish Torah, the law, for the present day situation.  The Pharisees approach to living among the Roman enemy was mostly a “quietly resist in place” strategy.  One was to carefully follow the guidance of the law, in hopes that this collective righteousness would provide fertile ground for the return of God’s righteous reign on earth.  Today, we hear a story of a particular Pharsiee who journeys out into the darkness of night to see Jesus, wending his way through the labyrinth of unlit streets that was first century Jerusalem. \\n\\tThe Pharisee Nicodemus of this nighttime encounter was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders.  Clearly a respected and important community leader.  But one might wonder, why was he sneaking around town in the dark?  Was he worried what his Jerusalem colleagues would think if he talked with Jesus?  Many of the Pharisees were increasingly concerned that Jesus’ teachings and rabble rousing would bring down the wrath of the Romans on the whole Jewish community.  But there was also an ancient tradition that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the complexities and marvel of the text.  Some Biblical commentators suggest that Nicodemus was a true seeker, had been paying attention to Jesus teaching and healing work, and now took the risk to come “study” him, in the still of the night (Patricia Farris, Christian Century, Jan. 30-Feb. 6, 2002).  \\n\\tNicodemus begins by respectfully addressing Jesus as “rabbi,” meaning revered teacher.   We hear the caution in his words; he politely acknowledges Jesus is from God, (not divine, from God) because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  Jesus seems to ignore Nicodemus’ careful opening words, and makes this curt and unexpected pronouncement:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  “Excuse me? What?” Nicodemus may well have responded.  \\n\\tThis language of being born again, and also the following verse about believing so you can have eternal life, has been incredibly divisive in the Christian church.  And it has made for a lot of stereotypes and bad press about purportedly exclusive Christian claims.  I am talking about the assumption that you are either in or you are out, depending on what you believe.  This has had disastrous historical consequences, of course, as anyone considered out has, at various times in church history, been shamed, excluded, persecuted and/or killed.  \\n\\tBut notice that Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God, like it is a locality, or, as many assume, a place we might arrive after we die.  He talks about “seeing,” or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, reign of justice and compassion among us.  Jesus speaks as if it is already here, all around and even within us.  Our problem seems to be with a deeper perception of the eyes of the heart.  “No one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew” replies Jesus in an intentionally ambiguous response. It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  Great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us! \\nPerhaps the Kingdom of God is a place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Perhaps he is describing a transformed awareness that “doesn’t make separations between God and humans” between Muslims and Christians, between Republicans and Democrats. It’s as though Jesus is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension that is there, welcoming him. (The contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault  Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind.  p. 30.) \\n Nicodemus can’t see or imagine himself being born again or anew or from above. That process looks too unknown, too problematic, too risky. He gets stuck in a literal interpretation:  “how in the world can you go back into your mother’s womb?” The man just can’t grasp that Jesus is talking about a transformative experience of the living God through knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to the Jesus in front of him.  \\t\\n\\t“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have everlasting life,” Jesus continues.  What was he really saying here?  “Your theological concepts need to be correct?” The Greek word for \"belief\" used here is less about an intellectual concept and more about an action. \\xa0The Greek work\\xa0credo,\\xa0\"I believe,\" is more accurately translated as \"I give my heart to\" or \"I trust in.\" \\xa0What is Jesus asking Nicodemus to give his heart to, to trust in? \\xa0A ticket to heaven?   But “eternal life” is always connected to Jesus’ promise that he has come to bring “life, and life abundantly” in the present.  It’s all about a deeper living, a fuller connection with God in this moment, a wider sense of relationship with and responsibility for other humans and creation.\\t\\t\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what happened to Nicodemus as he left Jesus that night.  But something must have started to work in Nicodemus, something began to “re-wire” inside of him and he perceived something anew.  Because later, when the chief priests and Pharisees want to have Jesus arrested, Nicodemus will insist that Jesus have a hearing before them first.   And perhaps most significant, it will be Nicodemus who joins Joseph of Arimathea to remove Jesus body from the cross after he is executed.   As the crowds disperse on that sad and awful late Good Friday afternoon, Nicodemus will bring pounds of spices with which to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.\\t\\n\\tWe don’t just want theological information; we yearn for a way in, to perceive God’s reign among us in a way that helps us be reborn and made new, again and again.  The spirit of the Living Jesus provides both context and illumination for this way into God.  Jesus waits for us in the quiet shadows of our hearts, ready to listen and to guide us.  May we meet him there.   Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThis Jonah text from the Hebrew Bible, our Old Testament, and the Mark text from the New Testament are both “fish stories,” in that exaggerated manner we talk about “the big fish that got away.”   Both are over-the-top, “tall tales,” in my view.  One story is about a huge fish that swallows and spits out a reluctant prophet.  The other about people becoming fishers of men as Jesus’ disciples, or as we would say more inclusively, becoming “fishers of people,” bringing people into the experience of God’s realm here on earth.  Frankly, I find the idea that Simon, Andrew, James and John immediately dropped their fishing nets, abandoning their boats, livelihoods and families to follow Jesus, hard to imagine. Just as hard to believe as this bizarre sounding tall-tale of a man entering, exiting and surviving the belly of a fish!   The New Testament fishermen’s behavior sounds rash and a tad irresponsible (what did their wives and children have to say about this?) and Jonah’s experience sounds like a fairy-tale, whimsical and far-fetched at best.  \\n\\t\\n\\tBut these stories are preserved in sacred Jewish and Christian scriptures as narratives, which reveal God’s nature and workings with us.   As we delve deeper into these two scriptures this morning, I suggest we keep asking ourselves:  what are we learning about God here?  God’s character, God’s priorities, God’s vision for the future among us?  Certainly, good questions for anyone seeking to connect more deeply with God.  Relevant ponderings for Falcon Heights Church United Church of Christ on the day of our Annual Meeting as a congregation.\\n \\t\\n\\tTurning first to the Jonah story, this is a satirical tale probably written during the 5th-4th century BCE; a time of post-exilic return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon.  This was a period of growing prosperity, self-focus and even smugness among Israel’s rulers, the socially elite and the religious leaders.  The anonymous author appears intent on challenging Israel’s increasing exclusivism and narrow religious views.   Don’t think for a minute that his or her listeners took this as a literal description of being swallowed by a whale.  To them, this was a challenging pronouncement about the truth of God’s intentions, woven through the symbolism of a wild story.  What might it mean for them to remember the wider call to show God’s loving mercy to all the nations, and not just their own people?  \\n\\t\\n\\tOne Lutheran colleague blogs about the Jonah story by noting: “Jonah is a book of prophecy in the way “The Daily Show” is news. When it comes to news, we often learn as much, or more, from the farce than you do from the serious version,” she writes ((Rev. Pam Fickenscher: pastorpam.typepad.com/living_word_by_word/).  Think of Saturday Night Live parodies of our current political issues, and before that the controversial offerings of the Smothers Brothers during the Vietnam War.   \\n\\t\\n\\tLet’s revisit the story and see if we can hear God’s truth:  The author sets the story’s scene at probably 9th-8th century BCE, when Assyria was a powerful foe to the Israelites.  Jonah, a minor Jew prophet, is called by God to “cry out against” a large non-Jewish city called Nineveh; a huge, prosperous, militarily strong metropolis in the Assyrian empire, somewhere near modern day Mosul in Iraq.    “There wickedness has come up before me,” says God to Jonah.  “You need to go warn them I am angry.”  “Uh….no can do” thinks Jonah, turning not east towards Nineveh, but jumping on a ship with a crew non-Jews, which is headed west to Tarshish.  \\n\\t\\n\\tJonah, notes the text, was seeking to “get away from the presence of the Lord.”  What an interesting notion!  This story existed for years in oral tradition, as did much of the Bible, and already the listening audience is chuckling.  “Get away from the presence of the Lord?”  Ha!  Fat chance!  As in any clever story, we are given a chance to ponder our own situation; “hmmmm…we might wonder; in what ways do I attempt to flee God’s presence?”  But God is getting impatient; the salvation of Nineveh, a pagan city, is at stake and Jonah is ignoring God’s call.  God whips up a huge storm, the sailors start frantically praying to their own gods for safety, but Jonah is down in the hold taking a nap.   Again, we might reflect for a moment on just what life storm we, our even our congregation, might be “sleeping through” at this time.  The captain appeals to Jonah to also pray, just as his crew is throwing lots trying to figure out who among them has brought this bad fortune.  Have to blame somebody! Jonah is revealed to be the problem, and as the crew frantically quizzes him about his origins and his mission, they learn he is fleeing the presence his own Lord.   What?!  Even although the crewmembers don’t believe in the Jewish God, they know this is bad news.  But before the crew can set upon him, Jonah hastily suggests they pitch him overboard.  The men resist, fearing being “guilty of innocent blood,” (interestingly righteous pagans, these men) but as the storm worsens they toss him into the raging sea.  The sea and its mysterious waters: always an ancient symbol of chaos and evil water demons.  But as Jonah hits the water, the wind and waves miraculously quiet.  The crew falls on their collective knees and is converted to the powerful God of the Israelites, and offer a “sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.”  Jonah, the supposedly righteous Israelite, is another story.\\n\\t\\n\\tHere is our hint of the narrator’s intent: Those outside the fold, the non-believers, are often quicker to hear God’s invitation, recognize their sins, repent and turn to God.   Thrashing in the water, Jonah is immediately swallowed by a large fish and remains there for three days.  Plunged into a sloshing, stinking void that we can hardly imagine, Jonah starts to pray.  There in chapter two we hear his rather obsequious fawning, “I am driven away from your sight: how shall I look again upon your holy temple?”  Jonah, remember, has tried to flee from God.  “As my life was ebbing away, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to you.”  No, Jonah remembered his own hide.  “O God,” drones Jonah, “those who worship vain idols forsake their true loyalty.”  What?  The guys on the boat who worshiped idols ended up converting to belief in God Almighty!  The ancient audience would now be shaking their collective heads in bemused disbelief.  “Deliverance belongs to the Lord!” Jonah piously intones.  The large fish, probably nauseated by these prayers, spits Jonah out on dry land. \\n\\t\\n\\tGod says a second time with increased urgency: “Get up, go to Nineveh and proclaim the message I tell you.”   What’s coming is the irony of a whole, pagan city repenting after they hear Jonah’s 7-word sermon.  “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”  It isn’t Jonah’s words they respond to, but the grace of the God who is behind the message.   From the king, to the commoners to the animals.  Even donkeys and oxen repenting, in ashes and sackcloth.  Sounds like an SNL skit to me.   But in the hilarity there is a message:  A whole city hears the invitation, changes its mind and lo and behold, God quickly changes God’s mind!   God had planned a retributive calamity to befall Nineveh, and now God does not do it.\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tBut Jonah’s response to the outsiders’ immediate repentance and God’s change of heart?  Jonah is furious!  Feeling ripped-off because God did not smite the city, he sulks:  “What’s the point of me going all the way to Nineveh if there isn’t some huge show-down between good and evil?”  A showdown between right and wrong.  Don’t we ache for this sometimes, in families, at work, in our church?  Joel seems indignant that God shows mercy on these people, these foreigners, these idol-worshippers.  The narrator wants Israel to consider Jonah’s narrow exclusivism and to be challenged themselves to repentance.  The narrator hopes to remind them of their call to preach to all the nations about God’s extraordinary mercy and forgiveness.   As part of the audience, I am reminded of how I, on occasion, have sat in bitterness and sulked, rather than embracing the fact that certain people in my life are now forgiven and enfolded in God’s loving mercy.\\n\\t\\n\\tTurning briefly to our other “fish story,” we see Jesus bursting on the scene as an adult, baptized by John and blessed by an otherworldly voice calling him Son, the Beloved.  Mark doesn’t mince words; his gospel book is spare and filled with urgency.  Immediately, Jesus is in Galilee, preaching that “the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”  \\n\\t\\n\\tHe speaks of the time of God’s just rule, where all are to be included; those who live in poverty and prison, those who are marginalized and those without hope.  “Come, come, be part of this,” Jesus says to some men casting their nets by the Sea of Galilee, “I’ll make you fish for people.”  And immediately the men respond.  Not unlike the pagan city of Nineveh.  They are invited not to be passive recipients of something, as in “come to Jesus and everything will be alright!”  They are to help lead others in experiencing the presence of the Kingdom of God, to know God who is urgent with aching care for Creation.  “Come, won’t you join with me?” God asks through Jesus.\\n\\t\\n\\tThere is a part of me that wants to dismiss the exaggerated hyperbole of these passages: God speaking to people directly?  Whoa, isn’t our news full of people doing awful things because they heard God tell them too?  And what about these fishermen: they leave co-workers to pick up the pieces, family members to fend for themselves!  So irresponsible, I can’t imagine any of this applying to my life today.  But Jesus’ eagerness, his insistence, is palpable, revealing God’s urgency in a new way.  “You are going to have to drop something, to let go of – what? – self-interest, certain limiting perspectives, destructive habits, incessant worry.”   This gives me pause: what are the nets I need to drop today to follow Jesus?  What nets does this congregation need to drop?   “Follow me and I will make you fish for people,” says Jesus.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.  ',\n",
       " \"\\tWhat is truth?  “Christ is Risen.”  This is the truth we proclaim on Easter morning. And it is an odd and nonsensical truth, because it does not make the kind of rational sense we typical look for in truth statements.  We tell the story of how Jesus of Nazareth was arrested, interrogated, tortured, hung on a cross to die and buried in a stone tomb.  And when the women came to finish preparing his body for burial on Sunday morning, his body was not there.   We read the Gospel accounts, and none of them are very satisfying.  There is no quantifiable detail here about a “bodily resurrection.”  We can never really know what happened inside that dark, sealed tomb.  And as much as Jesus may have forewarned his disciples, they really did not expect him to die.  They most certainly did not expect his body to disappear.  The women are looking for the dead body of their teacher and friend; they find nothing.  Numb with grief, staring into the tomb in shock and confusion, the women notice the two angelic creatures standing nearby:  “Why do you look for the living among the dead?” these dazzling strange beings ask the women, “He is not here, but has risen.”   Christ is Risen.   “For this I was born, for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth,” Jesus had said to Pilate just two days before.    I’m with Pilate at this point:  what is truth?  What is the “truth” in all of this?\\nMost of us like our truths to sound rational, justifiable; to be quantifiably subject to testing.  On Easter we rashly proclaim that Jesus rising from the dead challenges the assumed truth about death itself.  The resurrection testifies to the truth that we need not fear death at the end of our lives.  And that we ourselves can experience resurrection in the day-to-dayness of our present lives.  Or put more bluntly: our very lives themselves can be resurrected/transformed from their deadly ways.   Well, how can this be?  We want some hard core facts, but this morning all we get at the tomb is a blank space.  The women just keep staring into the empty tomb.  These strange men in glowing robes appear and ask “why do you look for the living among the dead?  He is not here but has risen.”  This is no way appears to be good news to these women.\\nI wonder if some truths are so overwhelming, not unlike the dazzling garments of the angels at the tomb, that we end up shifting our gaze.  We nervously look around somewhere else, wondering if we are seeing things, or being duped by fancy theological fireworks or perhaps this truth is just too radiant to be real.    \\n\\tEmily Dickenson, the 19th century American poet wrote about this dilemma of truth, in a poem called “Tell It Slant.” Printed at the end of our Order of Worship.\\nTell all the Truth but tell it slant \\n—\\u2028Success in Circuit lies;\\u2028\\nToo bright for mind's infirm intent, \\u2028\\nThe Truth's superb surprise.\\nAs Lightning to the Children eased,\\u2028\\n\\nWith explanation kind;\\u2028\\n\\nThe Truth must dazzle gradually,\\u2028\\n\\nOr every man be blind.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps we come to Easter this morning with a firm intent to better understand this unlikely truth that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead.  But it may be just too “bright for mind’s infirm intent” as Dickenson suggests. How might this truth of resurrection, of victory over death, of renewed life for each of us, not blind and disappoint us?  How might it “dazzle us gradually” so we can really absorb it?  So it can truly make a difference in the lives we chose and lead?\\n\\tIt’s a curious word Dickenson uses here: the “mind’s infirm intent.”  Infirm: weak, shaky, vacillating, insecure.  This may be a good description of how Jesus’ followers felt on Sunday morning.  The women who came to tomb appeared resolute in their intention to finish the burial preparations of washing and anointing their beloved friend’s body.  But they have to be numb with grief; they have been following this teacher for several years now, they were his disciples.  We can only imagine their further shock and confusion when they find the tomb empty.  They have come looking for a dead body and they find nothing.  And more disorienting, the figures at the tomb’s entrance tell the women to not look among the dead for the living, and that they must try and remember the things that Jesus told them.  This throws them off, because they and the other disciples are looking for their dead friend.  They are also not really wanting to remember much about the last few days.  It has been horrific to watch, and each of his followers is struggling with their own complicity with the violence that destroyed Jesus.  \\nRowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Anglican Church in England, describes in his book on the resurrection, that Jesus’ followers are disheartened and ashamed at this point (Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel).  They were unable to stop his death, in some cases they denied knowing him.  Most of them are hiding so they too won’t be picked up by the Romans as co-conspirators.  Even these determined disciples have traveled to the tomb under the safety of darkness. Are they stuck in their infirmed minds, which are filled with not just grief but immense regret and guilt?\\n\\tWe all know this territory, at some point in our lives.  We want to forget a part of our past, our complicity, and our participation both as victim and victimizer; we just don’t want to remember.  And in trying not to remember, we also may be drawn, ironically, to dead things.  Habits that slowly kill us, relationships that are poisonous, the pursuit of material acquisition that leaves us feeling hollow.        \\nRowen Williams writes that it is the disciple’s memory of Jesus, of both his love for them and their failure to save him, that will be “given back (to them) in a particular kind of context – in the presence of (the risen) Jesus.” (p. 29, Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel).  They will encounter him again and again in the coming weeks, along the road to Emmaus, at table with their friends, on a beach cooking fish for breakfast.  For all of us here this morning, for whatever reason: These are the stories to come back for, in the weeks to come.  This is where the truth of the resurrection slowly starts to dazzle.  Jesus will always appear first as a stranger, like truth coming in on a slant.  And each time he will welcome his friends lovingly, continue to teach and inspire them, and then urge them to preach and heal in his name.   They will recognize him as the Risen Jesus, Christ their Lord.  They will begin to know themselves as forgiven in that relationship, and that truth will transform them.  This sense of forgiveness, of welcome back into Jesus’ acceptance and love, will begin to redeem them, and their “infirm” minds.  They will become a community of forgiven people, reclaimed and forgiven by their Risen Lord, and will reach out to share that love and forgiveness with others.  \\n\\tHow often we resist this message of forgiveness and restoration, new life and hope.  We would rather continue staring at our old failures, transfixed by our misgivings.  We focus on our accumulated resentments.  We trust our “infirm mind” to decide what is really true.   We say that death is the end.  Our “infirm minds” keep telling us that violence resolves conflict; that materialist gain and personal power equals success.   We keep our eyes on the deadening prizes our culture says will truly bring us real living.  \\t\\n\\t“Why are you looking among the dead for the living,” asked the radiant creatures at the tomb.  This is the truth that comes to us “on a slant” this Easter morning.  Jesus is not here among our regrets and self-recrimination; Jesus is risen and is calling us to rise up in forgiveness and hope.  Christ has risen. Thanks be to God!  Alleluia and Amen.\",\n",
       " '\\tOne of my favorite things in the world is to wander around public libraries and bookstores….places where there are A LOT of books.  I could sit at home at my computer and search the internet for books….but mostly I would just bump into things I am already interested in.  You buy a book on-line and the on-line company suggests 5 other books you might like….because they are similar to what you just bought!  I wander around libraries and bookstores to find out about what I am NOT interested in…..or what I thought I might not be interested in.   Here’s how I do it:  I make sure I have some wander-time, not in a hurry.  I talk with God as I go in.  “God, here I am in this huge bookstore.  So many books, so little time.  Is there something new you want to show me?  Something I should learn, open my mind to?  Guide me God.”   I wander in the science section, in children’s books, in the manga section, cookbooks, travel section, all the literature classics I have yet to read.  Guide me, God.  This is all overwhelming!\\n\\tThis week, in my wanderings, I stumbled on book called:  “When God Winks.”   Yewww…inspirational literature.  Wishes and winks.  God answers every wish.  Hmmmm.   I started reading a bit:  author says he remembers when he was a young boy, chaotic family dinner, he felt left out, remembered his Grandmother looking across the table with a smile and winking at him:  Sort of a “hey kid, I see you and I’m here with you!”  He talked about a hard time in his adult life when his little baby boy was very sick….and all the unusual things and surprising people that came into his life to help his son get better.  Like coincidences, sort of.  He said it felt like God was winking at him, “hey, I see you and I’m here with you!”  \\n\\t GOD wink at us as a way to communicate.?  The book suggested that little coincidences that happen are one of the ways God talks with us.  We pray about something, and God sends hints, big and small, to answer us, to guide us.  Well, but how DOES God talk to us?  If you were God, how would you talk with your humans without freaking them out?\\t\\n\\tI wonder if our Bible story today is like God winking?  The head servant got a God Wink.  His master Abraham said, “my son really needs a wife; go back to my father’s family a few days journey from here and find her a wife.”  Head servant prays to God, and God says “first gal that brings water.”  Travels, at well, young girl offers water.  Coincidence?  God Wink?  Jacob got a God Wink.  \\n\\tSometimes people think they have a God wink or a God nod – like God wants them to do something and it really isn’t of God.  ISIS thinks it got a God Wink; other Muslims think this is terrible!  Quote on “if your God hates everyone you hate.”  There are even parts of the Bible where it shows people hating and being cruel to other people and saying that God wants this.  \\n\\tMaybe we have to test our God Winks out with other winks.  Does this match with what people I love and respect are telling me?  Does this match up with what Jesus would do?  If God is a God of love and justice, how does my idea match with a loving and just God?\\n\\n\\tWatch for the God Winks.  God has a much bigger perspective on things than we do.  God wants us to live full joyful lives, where we get to use all of our talents and gifts.  God wants us to help take care of the world and make it better.  God really is trying to communicate with us.  Watch for the God Winks.  \\n',\n",
       " '\\tAs I considered our texts for today, I found myself wondering about how these shepherd, sheep and lamb images from the Revised Common Lectionary help us better understand the ways of love.  God’s love for us, Jesus as the teacher and revealer of the heart of God, and our loving of one another.   In ancient Biblical times, a good shepherd was used as metaphor for the good king who cared for his subjects and ruled with mercy and justice.  Throughout Jewish history, corrupt and unjust kings were referred to as “bad shepherds” who did not watch out for their whole flock.  Jesus told parables about shepherds, and used the metaphor of “sheep” for his followers who were to listen to and recognize his voice as that of the Good Shepherd.  They “hear” him and follow, and they experience transformed and abundant life in the present.  He also used the sheep metaphor for the flocks of people that the disciples were to minister to in Jesus’ name.   In this shepherd, sheep mix, we find added the early church’s depiction of Jesus as a sacrificial lamb.  Early Christian tombs were often covered with artwork depicting Jesus as a Lamb.  We hear this curious vision from the much mis-interpreted Book of Revelation, that appears to describes how “Lamb at the center of (God’s) throne will be their shepherd.”  Shepherds, sheep, lambs and…...mothers.  Hmmmmmm.   \\n\\tFirst I should say that there a few things that give me pause when it comes to Mother’s Day. This day can get a bit problematic.  It’s not just the cloying greeting cards and the wild mix of expectations associated with this day.  Relationships with our mothers, mother-memories and the experience of mothering are a complicated mix.   On Mother’s Day, the church does well to recognize that this is a tough day for some folks.  Some people may have never met their birth mother or have become estranged from her.  Some of us may have people who became “mother” for us.  There are those among us who have mostly happy memories of our mothers.  But many of us will out live our mothers and Mother’s Day may be a poignant reminder of someone who is now sadly absent.  There are those among us for whom the memories of mother may be a shadowy vagueness at best.  At worst, these memories may be filled with deep sadness, or sometimes even with terror and hate.  Mother’s Day can be a delight and it can be awkward or downright painful.   Let’s not generalize about this tender day, least of all here in our faith community.\\n\\tTo complicate things even more on Mother’s Day, there are a wide variety of experiences related to being or not being a mother.   Joy and grief, missed opportunities and unwanted responsibilities, accomplishment and failure, sin and forgiveness.  Regret, surprise, hope.  Not unlike what God experiences in dealing with humans!  And all of this intricately connected to human love and relationship: trying to love, failing to love, being loved, feeling loved, feeling unloved.  We claim as Christians that God is love.  “Love one another, as I have loved you,” commanded Jesus of his followers.  Given this complicated context of Mother’s Day, what more might we understand about love…..from the Biblical sheep-herding world?   \\n\\tIn encounter after encounter during his earthly ministry, Jesus invited people not so much to believe a certain doctrine about him but to simply to “follow me.”  When asked where he dwelled, he would reply “come and see.”   But it was never a specific habitation; people were invited simply into his presence, into a relationship with him, to hear his voice.  And the resurrection appearances, whatever those were, convinced his followers that this ongoing relationship of compassion and clarity was still unfolding.  The writer of John’s Gospel and his community were experiencing the reality of this on-going connection with Jesus, some 70-90 years after his death. As John weaves together stories about Jesus’ ministry, he wants them to know that this “good shepherd” wants them to grow in love, be brave in love.  Which meant to stop clinging to the places where the world insisted they would be secure, where they would be acclaimed, where they might be powerful.  In the passage from John we just heard, he recounts a conversation between Jesus and the leaders of the Jerusalem Temple.  The Jewish leaders want him to simply things.  “Tell us plainly, are you the Messiah? The anointed one who comes to save Israel?”  They are eager to reduce him to a title, which will allow them to nail down his program:  are you like one of those rabble-rousing rebels, the Maccabeans, who we celebrate on this Feast of the Dedication, the Feast of Lights and Hanukkah?  Let us know, please, because we are wary of allowing threats to the populace, and the Romans are getting understandably nervous about the crowds you are drawing.  Come on Jesus, tell us if you are one of those terrorists for the Lord or not!  But Jesus doesn’t bite.  He won’t let them reduce him to a simplistic title.  “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify to me” he says to them.  It’s as if he is saying: you don’t get it because you don’t participate in this new Way; you don’t belong to my flock, to my sheep…that is….you aren’t following me.” \\nJesus would have grown up hearing Psalm 23, where we are reminded of how the God of all creation as the “good shepherd.”  Most other Psalms use militaristic language when they describe God’s protective presence:  God is a fortress or stronghold; a high place or refuge; all military terms that might fit better with saying “the Lord is my King” or “the Lord is my commander” (Kenneth Bailey, Presbyterian Outlook 2008, “Psalm 23 and Jesus).   This is the Psalm that leads us into some counter-intuitive statements about a loving God: “ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”  This, in a predominant culture that is constantly convincing us of things we might want and desire.  “I walk through the darkest valley, down the gully, the crevice, and I fear no evil.”  This, in a world where we are constantly worried about security, where we are seek to root out the suspicious looking ones in our midst, from potential terrorists to undocumented workers.   \\nFinally, in a subtle shift, the Psalmist brings us from the shepherd’s field to the dining room, and lifts another counter-intuitive image:  This loving God who works so intimately in our lives as an attentive shepherd is also gracious host.  This God spreads out a table before us “in the presence of our enemies.”  A traditional feminine role, a mothering function.  Love provides food, oil, overflowing cups, abundance.  \\nWe have to practice receiving from God the shepherd, mothering host.  We have to practice because this does not come natural to us.  It may make us feel too dependent as adults.  We are naturally bent on establishing our own security and survival as adults.  Self-preservation!  If we are fortunate enough to have the basics covered, we move on to establishing and preserving our own individual status and self-esteem.  We want to nail other people down with generalizations:  you are always this way, you never do this.  We over-simplify and over-state a situation and cling to our polarized positions, when the reality at hand (in our family, our workplace, our church) is much more complicated. We brace ourselves and we hold on tight.  Consequently, our ears close to the deep, quiet voice of the loving Shepherd. \\nThe irony is that it is only in the daily softening of our hold on this self-preservation program that we become available to God’s loving presence.  It helps us have the security to love bravely.  The invitation to daily prayer practices of surrender and letting go, releasing the places where we cling, slowly guides us into God’s care and then out to love courageously and minister in this hurting world.  \\nWhere might we each encounter the Good Shepherd this week?  Watch for green pastures and cool waters that come your way; notice what happens as you walk through those dark places.  Where will we be invited to sit at the table of this Gracious Host?  Watch for those places of abundance, even with the enemies of scarcity and despair in the wings.  Let the food and the oil and the overflowing cup quietly astound you.  Amen.   ',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe setting for today’s Gospel reading from John is the Last Supper, right before Jesus is arrested.  At the time of this writing, John’s community is living some 60-70 years after the last supper. The author presents this event in a uniquely creative manner, weaving historical recollection with his own theological interpretation of the events of that precious final evening. The narrative is a sweet goodbye message in which we find a strange combination of sadness and hopefulness. \\nJohn describes Jesus as trying to explain to his followers that he has to depart.  They will no longer have him in their lives.  They will have to go on with their outreach ministry without him…and yet, and yet, they will not be alone.  If Jesus sounds a bit ambiguous here, well…he is talking about something that is actually quite ambiguous.  Jesus gone, dead, not here; Jesus here in a different way….? \\n“Are you going to be here with us or not, Jesus?”  we might well have inquired, if we had been sitting at that table. Jesus goes on to describe how God will send a comforter, an advocate, the Holy Spirit that will fill them and guide them.  He gives his listeners this tender image of he and God coming to them and making “our home with them.”  But such curious symbolic language – Jesus and God setting up homemaking in their followers; God, a homemaker? \\n\\tThe church has preserved these ancient words, down through the centuries.  It is mysterious language, language which I believe is symbolic of an unseen reality that permeates our lives as followers of Jesus.   God and the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, making their home with us, in us.  They take up residence in us as we “keep” Jesus’ words.  You and I are the home, homes, essentially, of the Creator of the Universe.  I don’t take this to mean we are God’s only home; what is suggested here is simply that God and the Risen Jesus Christ take up residence in us.  How are we to make sense of this?   \\n\\t Thinking ahead to Mother’s Day this next weekend, I have been remembering how my sister-in-law sent out a Mother’s Day email a few years ago from her home in Pittsburg.  It went to all of us Swallow women.  She urged us to visit a website she had been tracking.  The site was following the nesting habits of two peregrine falcon females in downtown Pittsburg, PA by live-streaming web cams situated above each of the two nests.  If you know Pittsburg, one web cam wired nest is located at the downtown Gulf Tower, and the other at the Cathedral of Learning on the University of Pittsburg campus.  “Check this out,” wrote Laura, “I look in on these two Mama birds several times a day and am rooting for them.”  Of course, I quickly logged on to the University site, and watched in fascination while a group of 5 tiny chicks were rolling around on top of each other, live, impatiently waiting for the return of their mama bird. Then switching to the Gulf Tower, I witnessed the second mother hunkered down over her unhatched eggs, visibly shivering in the blustery wind.  Traffic sounds bristled through the microphones.  I checked back in on the five chicks.  Mom had now returned, and they were all making a quite racket as she bustled around the nest stuffing food into their gaping mouths.  Live, from Pittsburg, it was Saturday afternoon in the peregrine falcon nests!   After drastic decline in the 1960’s, as a result of DDT, other environmental toxins and loss of habitat, these falcons were again making their home among us. After almost disappearing, the birds had returned and were reproducing.  People around the world are watching, offering encouraging words and monetary support.\\n\\tThinking about these beautiful and powerful peregrine falcons who had almost disappeared, I reflected on how sometimes we get to a point where our sense of connection with the living God almost disappears, even dies.  Perhaps this has happened to you at some time in your life, or maybe even now.  That place, that nest within that held a sense of God seems to have fallen into disrepair, or it has simply disintegrated in our hearts.  We can’t even imagine God finding a home in us anymore, nesting within us.  Or maybe it seems like this has never even really happened.  What a strange idea, we may think to ourselves.  This mystical language seems foreign to our way of thinking and experiencing the world.  \\nHenry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest and theologian, writes in his slim and haunting book, The Way of the Heart, about this active presence of God finding a home in us.  He speaks about how we can “slowly build a little nest” of prayer and openness for God inside of us.  It’s as though the words of simple prayer, even a slowly repeated short phrase such as “God, I wondering about you,” or “Spirit, are you there?” or “Open my heart,” build a nest.   Anne Lamott’s new book about prayer, entitled: “Help Thanks Wow: The Three Essential Prayers puts it even more bluntly.  Help; thanks; wow – those are the ways to start building this nest inside of us, she says.  With a delightful sense of irreverence she pushes me to remember that I do well to acknowledge my need for assistance, to speak my appreciation and declare sense of wonder regularly.  Help.  Thanks.  Wow.  These daily, simple prayers “slowly build a little nest for themselves in our heart and stay there for the rest of our busy day.  Even while we are talking, studying, commuting, gardening, or building,” writes Nouwen, “the prayer can continue in our heart and keep us aware of God’s ever-present guidance” (p. 82, The Way of the Heart).\\nMaybe this is the part that is our job:  slowly building this nest inside, stick by twig, fiber by feather, prayer by prayer.  Maybe this is the essential job of the church: to help us individually and communally build a nest to receive the living presence of God.  To receive the living presence of the One who so wants to make His, Her, home within us.  Over and over, scripture describes how God deeply longs to settle in the nest of our hearts and create the new within us.  This almighty creator God, Father/Mother God, yearns to lay precious eggs of new life within our hearts.  New life that need’s God’s feathery warmth and nurture to grow and hatch.

       " '\\n\\tDinner’s like this one described in the passage from Luke were no private affair.  Although the details focus on the host, a certain Pharisee named Simon, Jesus and an unknown woman, there are most likely a number of others in the house:  more guests also reclined in the new Roman fashion around the table, those serving the food, Jesus disciples, and always the on-lookers.  We might imagine ourselves on the edge of the room, joining the curious people at the door and just outside….all eager to witness what this unusual teacher healer was going to do next.   We would know Simon, a respected a teacher of Jewish written Law in our city.  Maybe we had consulted him about the precepts which governed our spiritual and communal lives together.  He knew both the Torah given to Moses centuries before, which governed all of their lives, as well as the oral knowledge passed down from Moses to later generations, which had now been codified in the Talmud.  We would not be aware that the Pharisees would be portrayed so negatively in centuries to come, as the tension between synagogues and Jesus followers would grow after his death.  We would probably feel more comfortable around these working class Pharisees, compared to the aristocratic and priestly elites, the Sadducees.  As on-lookers, we are interested that Simon knows and respects Jesus, has invited him to his home and calls him “teacher.”  \\n\\n\\tBut this tale is not known as Simon the Pharisee’s story, which is curious in itself.  This story shows up in all four Gospels, which is unusual, and is known through the centuries as the “story of the sinful woman.”  Luke never tells us who she is.  The woman is not named in the story and never speaks. What is really quite incredible is that different threads of this extraordinary encounter between Jesus and this unnamed woman actually have reached us some 2000 years later.   As we re-enter this ancient room, and carefully watch the scene unfold, I suggest that we may catch a glimpse of what God is doing in our midst today. \\t   \\n\\tIn each of the four New Testament Gospels, we have variations of this story of a woman unexpectedly pouring costly perfume upon Jesus as he sits at dinner in someone’s home.  Luke says she pours precious oil on Jesus feet.  Gospel of Mark says she pours perfume from an alabaster jar on his head, which was the manner in which prophets anointed the ancient kings of Israel, as a sign of God’s chosen one, Messiah.  Was she a Temple prophetess, recent scholars have debated?  Why does Jesus say at the end of the Mark portion, “Truly I tell you, wherever the good news[c]\\xa0is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”  Do later Gospel writers see this as too elevating, to controversial in the patriarchal Greco-Roman culture, for a woman disciple, and as they neatly delete this detail?  Intriguing questions about how the church, even our society today, has “seen” women.  \\tComparing the different stories gives us a flavor of how inconsistent these different Gospel accounts can be, each written from a different time for a different community, with a somewhat different theological perspective.  A good reminder that have diversity in our beliefs about Jesus is a very old and honored tradition!  The story in Matthew, Mark and John, each focus on Jesus’ disciples who are appalled at this wastefulness and are making quite a reasonable ruckus about how the money could have gone to help the poor.  Jesus makes a rather enigmatic reference to the poor always being with them, but that they will not always have him.   In each of these texts, the reader is pointed ahead to the event that both reader and author anticipate: Jesus crucifixion and burial.\\nBut Luke is doing something different with the narrative as he tells it; his agenda is always on Jesus’ outreach to the marginalized as a sign of God’s Kingdom breaking through in the present, right in front of our eyes.   And I find this particularly challenging, because its hard to keep looking at the injustice and the suffering of this world.  I get compassion fatigue.  It’s hard to keep paying attention and really seeing what is before my eyes.  What does Luke want us to know about how Jesus sees?\\nAs Luke tells the story, our dinner guests would be reclining, waiting both for a lavish spread and for interesting philosophical discourse among other learned men.  They are there to drink, eat and debate, and would have be startled by the woman’s sudden appearance.  But she is not a table server nor an entertaining dancing girl.  Luke says she was a sinner, which has led to considerable lascivious debate about the possible sexualized nature of her sins, but the text is ultimately silent on this matter.  Feminist scholars have noted that traditional male Biblical commentators have not debated the sins of Peter, one of Jesus’ early disciples, even when he confesses to be a sinner himself.  Why all the attention on this woman’s presumed exotic occupational life?  Because it’s so titillating to the male scholar?  She could have been a sinner, which meant ritually unclean, for any number of reasons in that culture.  Maybe she had a physical deformity.  Maybe she stole from her neighbor or poisoned her husband.   We don’t know!  \\nWhat would it have been like to be in the room that night and watch her do this?  Standing behind Jesus reclined body, she weeps copiously, her tears fall on his feet, she wipes them with her hair, pours oil on his feet, says Luke, and kisses them.  The intimacy of this interaction would have made me want to cover my eyes or even leave the room.   I wonder if her silent outburst at Jesus feet is so discomforting, that we have needed to dismiss her as far away as possible. Her emotions are so dramatically revealed and her actions are so unabashedly physical and sensual.  Not sexual, but sensual.  She needs to be someone very separate from us in our own propriety righteousness.  Hence, a prostitute. But women let their hair down for a number of reasons…yes, enticement, is surely one of them.  But also is shame and grief.  \\nThere is such boldness and intimacy in their encounter it is difficult to imagine she and Jesus are total strangers.  But my sense is that as she silently approaches Jesus, everything inside of her collides.  Judgment and confession and absolution and forgiveness all wordlessly tumble together.  The silent approach, tears stinging her eyes and flowing down her checks uncontrollably, opening the jar and pouring, the wiping of the feet.  Whatever her sins, she had a bodily knowing that Jesus sees her, yes judges her, with mercy understands her, forgives and accepts her, welcomes her.   In a deep, life-changing way, this woman has been transformed.  \\n\\tBut Simon the Pharisee is also in the room, and his blood is starting to boil.  His judging is of a different sort, done from his person sense of his own righteousness and distance from those who are sinners, outcasts, marginalized in his world.  This woman’s actions are an unseemly disruption in his carefully planned evening with the intriguing young rabbi. So often, the suffering, the neediness of others, feels like a huge interruption.  We watch a BLM demonstration on TV and say to ourselves: Please, just be quiet, stop protesting, don’t inconvenience me.  We are  loathe see the historical context, the present day inequities and our current complicity in the suffering around us.   Simon casts a glance at this embarrassingly intimate scene at his dinner table and seethes indignantly to himself.  He silently questions Jesus’ identity and status as a prophetic figure.  “Gracious, the man is actually letting this unclean woman touch him!  Clearly he is no prophet!”  Jesus, ever the intuitive, reads Simons consternation and calmly outlines a parable regarding the cancellation of small and large debts.   And then turning his gaze towards the woman, he asks Simon, “do you see this woman?”  Do. You. Even. See Her?    \\n\\tThe Apostle Paul will later write in a letter in a letter to the early Christians in Galatia:  “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.”  We have the spirit of the living Jesus Christ abiding within us, explains Paul.  I find this both challenging and intriguing; that if I pay attention, I can hear with Jesus’ ears and understanding.  If I open my awareness, pay attention and focus, I can see with Jesus’ eyes and compassion.  The word compassion actually means for our “guts to churn.”  It is in us, this ability see with his eyes, to feel with his guts even.  This is extraordinary.  And good gracious, this is burdensome!   Sometimes we see the hurts and needs of a friend or family member and we don’t know what to do.  We hear about frantic refugees from the middle east and north Africa climbing into flimsy liferafts, and we groan inwardly for the lost and the survivors.  We start wondering and thinking together about what piece of this is about us and what do we do next?  It feels burdensome and overwhelming to keep paying attention.\\n\\t Part of what we do is to bring these burdens of sight, of seeing with the eyes of the Risen Jesus Christ, to worship, to our church.  We come to this place where we work together on envisioning new possibilities.  And perhaps even more poignantly, we begin might begin to see each other within community with Jesus eyes.  The person we disagreed with over a Board decision; the person we will never see eye-to-eye with about the treatment of a previous pastor.  What do Jesus’ eyes see when his living spirit looks at these people we would, frankly, rather not see again?\\n\\t“Do you see this woman?” Jesus asked Simon the Pharisee.  Do I see the transformation, the inherent goodness, the belovedness preciousness of the people around me?  This seeing is both a joy and a deep responsibilitity.  No wonder we need to study and pray and think together as a community of faith.   For this ability to see with Jesus’ eyes, I give thanks to God. Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tAt first glance, the Luke passage today seems to be about what happens to us when we die.  Which seems a tad irrelevant given our current concerns with LIVING and getting through this upcoming election on Tuesday.  But sometimes we do question our own and others’ destinies beyond this life.  And I think this impacts how we actually live.  Even more poignantly, we wonder about our connection with those who have died before us, loved ones in peacetime and on days like Veterans Day, those who have died in warfare far away.  The Apostle Paul writes in his letter to the congregation at Ephesus, some 20-30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus:  Allow “the eyes of your heart to be enlighted,” Paul writes, so “you may know what is the hope to which Jesus Christ has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints” that we have from all those who have gone on before us.   We are connected with this “cloud of witnesses” Paul calls it in another letter.   Now, and after we die.  What does this do to us in the now?  What have we “inherited?” Is it just about some reassurance about the afterlife?   \\n\\tI wonder if today’s scripture text from Luke is not really about what the Sadducees think about the inhabitants of heaven.  It may be more about what their rigid and restrictive attitudes about living in community in the present.   At this point in Luke’s gospel Jesus has finally arrived in Jerusalem, where he will be arrested, questioned by religious authorities from his own tradition and then tried and murdered by the Romans. In today’s passage, the Sadducees, the priestly class who oversaw all Temple worship and rituals, confront Jesus.  They pull out all the stops with this strange provocation about after-life and remarriage.  Their approach to Jesus is odd; it was well-known that the  Sadduces  did not believe in the immortality of the soul.  You die, you that’s it.  Your eternal life, your legacy, was only through your descendants.\\n\\tThe Sadduces set up this weird, hypothetical situation about a woman with the seven husbands:  Jesus, tell us….who does she end up with in afterlife?  What is this, some kind of heaven joke, the crowd may be wondering.  In heaven, which of the brothers will finally get the poor widow pregnant?  Torah, Jewish law, did say that brothers should marry a widowed sister-in-law, to provide descendants and continuation of the deceased man’s name.  But this is such a convoluted story that there ought to be some punch-line about God setting up some wife-swapping commune on a cloud.  The Sadduces were not going for laughs.  They are drop-dead serious religious leaders who sensed their authority, and the safety of their community, is was being threatened by Jesus.  They are looking to entrap Jesus with this ridiculous story about marital law and bodily resurrection, hoping to discredit him.  \\n\\tAt this point, Jewish religious leaders are concerned that Jesus is riling up the crowds of the common folk with his provocative teachings and making them all possible targets for increased Roman oppression.  These religious leaders are starting to feel threatened and scared.  And fear often gets us cranky and leads us to asking bad questions, like this one about marrying in heaven.   We start demanding things in irritated tones like: “what on earth are you doing?”  or “what are you thinking?!” We begin to worry and fret, asking ourselves bad questions like: “how can protect myself in this unsettling situation; how can I keep everything the same and not make any changes in my life, my job, my church?  Or, how can I keep these strange and different people away from me?”  When I think about it, this election campaign has gotten all of us, candidates and voters alike, pretty cranky, and perhaps focusing on the wrong questions.\\n\\tOur MN Conference minister, The Rev. Shari Prestemon, wrote in her regular pastoral letter to our MN churches last week: “This political season has exposed quite devastatingly the polarization that presently characterizes our nation and world.\\xa0 And at the root of it all is an anger and fear that has us unraveling.”  Like the threatened Sadduces, there are those who have insisted on bad questions like “how do we keep immigrants out? how do we win again, be great again, how do we protect ourselves from Muslims and Mexicans?”   Prestemon continues, “Our country has certainly known other moments in its history of such rancor and division,” she continues.\\xa0 “Abraham Lincoln profoundly acknowledged one of those moments at the close of the Civil War in 1865, when he said in his second inaugural address, ‘With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds…’ COMMAnts from the Conference Minister – November 2016. - Politics, Polarization, & Us\\n\\tIn response to the Saducess bad question, Jesus simply shifts the focus.  God is with us even in death, is his point.  He doesn’t describe what this will be like, but it is clear that whatever happens, it includes saints and sinners alike.  We are “in” God now, we inhabit, swim in, breathe in, God’s transformative presence now and always; all of us.  How do we live this out and bind up each other’s wounds? will be Jesus question.  What work for the common good might this reality enable us to do?  God has a relationship with us in life and death, and that fact should permeate each moment we are conscious.  Jesus used the phrase “children of the resurrection” which is who we are. Children of God, always in God.  Now and in death.\\t\\n\\tRev. Prestemon closes her pastoral letter with these words:  “In the United Church of Christ, we like to think of ourselves as a big enough ‘tent’ to welcome all voices, \\xa0theologies, and political persuasions.\\xa0 This is one of those moments that tests this treasured image.\\xa0 We are also a church that believes firmly in the intersection of faith and the public square.\\xa0 Today that public square is riddled with disunity, distrust, and dangerous rhetoric. May we step into that square bearing the prophetic wisdom, unyielding love, and abiding hope that makes our unique voice an essential one for these days.”  \\n\\tAnd so you and I are invited to step into the public square this Tuesday.  We have the privilege and duty to enter polling stations with the intent to join a “cloud of witnesses” who have voted for the common good, over the years before us.  We step into a public square that is truly “riddled with disunity and distrust.”  Yes.  And we choose to enable abundant life in the present. Thanks be to God.  Amen.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrayer for Election Times \\nHoly One, you have given us this earth and each other to love so that we might be one world community of justice, peace and mercy. Today we pray to you for the sake of our nation. Be in our hearts and minds as we contemplate the Presidency of the strongest nation on earth. Renew our democracy. Empower us to vote with integrity and with concern for all, but especially with concern for the poor and the voiceless. Embolden us to stand up against bigotry. Teach us to discern the path of hope, for our world and our earth depend on it. Amen.\\n\\n\\nDavida Foy Crabtree – former CT Conference Minister\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThe travelers hopscotch up the western coast of the Aegan sea and end up to Philippi, leading city of then Macedonia, current day Greece.  They hang out for a few days; nothing much seems to happen.  On the Sabbath day of rest and worship, they hear of others who gather down at the nearby river for prayer.  Is it a synagogue or just an outdoor worship spot?  Anyone else besides this group of women there?  Not sure.  But what emerges is this curious detail about another sojourner not unlike themselves:  A traveling tradeswoman named Lydia, a dealer in rare and precious purple cloth, originally from the city of Thyatira (back over on the other side of the Aegaen Sea, in Asia Minor).   Notice how she is named, which is rare for women in the hugely patriarchal Biblical tradition.  Feminist scholarship in the last few decades has revealed that women like Lydia were quite prominent in the early church, and were more instrumental than history has led us to believe, as both missionaries and preachers of the Gospel.  \\n\\tIn this text, Lydia is described as a “God fearer” which means she was probably an educated, Hellenized Greek, a sophisticated urban person, who found the ethical teachings and monotheism of Judaism to be compelling.  It was not uncommon for women of means to hold gatherings of prevailing religious movements in their homes, be they the cult of Dionysus or the early Christian house meetings.  We learn here that God opens her heart as she listens to Paul talk about Jesus, and his way of compassion and justice for all.  She is profoundly moved.  She owns a large home in the city, as indicated by her whole “household” (relatives, servants, etc) being baptized along with her.  And here’s where I think the author of Acts wants us to pay attention, because this “foreigner,” outsider to the faith, acts out an essential principal of the Jewish Torah and of Jesus’ ministry:  hospitality to the stranger.  She implores Paul and his company to come stay at her home.  God makes a home in her, and she opens her home, her resources, her heart to strangers.   She is an outsider to the Jewish faith, but seems to understand intuitively a central aspect of Jewish spiritual practice: hospitality to “the stranger who sojourns with you in your land” as described in the Torah, the Book of Jewish Law in our Old Testament book of Leviticus.  \\n\\tI believe true hospitality is a central challenge to the contemporary church.  I’m not talking just tea, cookies and bars here.  The essential hospitality question that should be addressed in the any interim period is: who is our neighbor now?  Are we paying attention to our current neighbors in the way Jesus defined neighbor: the person we don’t expect to connect with, the outsider, the stranger, in our midst?  It’s surprisingly easy for congregations to lose track of their ministry context.  We lose track of, or choose to ignore, changes that occur over the years in the neighborhood.  Original families move to outlying areas, and sometimes congregations suddenly realize they don’t recognize or relate to or really serve their neighborhood anymore.  The school down the street has an increasingly diverse population of students and families, some even from newly arriving immigrant groups.  Who are the strangers, the sojourners in our midst, that God desires us to draw into a deeper experience of God’s hospitality, God’s grace, God’s extravagant welcome?\\n\\tIf God’s vision for you is to be seekers and SERVANTS of God’s transforming love, which parts of the wider neighborhood do you hope to serve? I speak here of broader serving connections where we interact with those who are different from us not in a paternalist way, a one-way interaction where we have something to give them.  But where we meet as equals with curiosity, and are possibly changed in the interaction. Who are these people and what are they experiencing: materially, emotionally, spiritually? \\n\\tSo much has changed since many of our ancestors came to this country.  My English ancestors blended in and were naturally welcome.  They knew the language.  Scandinavian and German immigrants to Minnesota had to learn a new language, yes, but there was land available and they blended in with their Northern European ways and white skin.   After hearing the veteran NPR correspondent, Tom Gjelten, speak on MPR, I’ve been reading his book, A Nation of Nations.  I hadn’t quite realized how, prior to 1965, 3 out of 4 immigrants to this country came from Europe.  Gjelten writes that “the question of which foreigners would be welcomed and under what conditions was a subject of intense discussion” since the founding of this nation  (p. 80).  Some of my northern European grandparents’ prejudicial perspectives make sense to me now, as I read of how this country repeatedly sought immigration restrictions, from the early colonies up until the middle of the 20th century. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” written on the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor has not meant that everyone was welcome. \\n\\tIn 1965 national legislation ended the allocation of immigrant visas on the basis of national origin.  Since that time ”the percentage of the US population born outside the country tripled and shifted dramatically in composition, with immigrants arriving from” the Far East, Africa, Central America, the Middle East.  Some of current political debate questions whether we have been too generous and even reckless in this radical hospitality.  But people come to American just like most of our ancestors did; because opportunites were lacking and they are attracted to the possibilities America offers.  More recently, and more desperately, they come because they are fleeing war, severe economic oppression, starvation, persecution.  What complicates things is their “ideas about God, family and work (often) set them apart.” and “devout Musilims (stand) out in particular.”  And immigrants are experiencing “rejection and disappoint that cuts even deeper than the pain” that caused them to leave their homes in the first place. (p. 9)  In Minnesota the leading number of recent immigrants are from, in descending order, Mexico, India, Laos, Somalia, Vietnam, Thailand (including Hmong), China, Korea, Ethiopia, and Canada. While immigrants are transforming many smaller communities across the state, about 80 percent of the state's foreign-born residents\\xa07-county region.( http://www.mncompass.org/immigration/overview).\\n\\tAs Jesus is talking with his disciples before his arrest, he tells them not to let their hearts be troubled by the possibility of his dying.  He speaks of how their love for him, and one another, allows Jesus and God to dwell in them, to actually come make a “home” in them.  To explain what this is like, Jesus uses the mysterious metaphor of “the Advocate,” the companionship of the Holy Spirit.  “God will send the Holy Spirit in my name,” explains Jesus, “and the Spirit will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.”  How hospitable am I to divine guidance making a home in me?  Am I open to direction beyond my own good thinking, when Plan A doesn’t make sense anymore and even Plan B falters?  At home in us, the Spirit informs and directs us as we stretch out and do something different, as we reach out to and are changed by strangers and sojourners in our midst.  This is what allows us to move beyond suspicison and fear of those who are different.  A group in our congregation have begun meeting twice a month at the Fairview Community Center in Roseville for English language practice with new immigrants in our community.  Besides being able to give of their time and English expertise, they have some interesting stories to tell about what they are noticing is changing inside of them. \\n\\tWelcoming God’s indwelling within our hearts; opening our hearts, our spaces, our resources to the strangers among us.   Down by the river, outside the ancient city of Phillipi, Lydia welcomed God’s spirit into her heart and gospel-preaching strangers into her home.  How might we be drawing people into a deeper experience of God’s hospitality and grace?   Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\\nAs Marge Piercy writes in the final lines of her poem “To Be of Use” (printed on the front of our worship bulletin), “The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real.”  I invite us to think a bit this morning, on this Labor Day weekend, about our work and how it connects with our sense of call as Christians in this world.  And I suggest we think of work not just as paid job or carrier, but work as any productive activity that people do, whether paid or unpaid, past or present.   What have been the jobs that you have loved?  Which have been the hardest or the perhaps the most mind-numbing?  Physically challenging?  Mind expanding?  Brought you into teamwork with a wonderful group of people?  Challenged you to use your talents and gifts to the fullest?\\n\\tLabor Day isn’t in the church calendar; it’s not a religious holiday.  But as I read the story of the Israelites working under Pharaoh, and slaving away in horrendous working conditions doing dangerous tasks, I thought of the original intent of the Labor Day holiday.  It was established by the US Congress in 1894,to honor the laborer – at that time mainly the working MAN – and give him a “timely rest” for his labors.  This, or course, usually entailed an increased amount of holiday cooking for the woman of the house – with little rest from her labors.   It’s an interesting question: how do we “honor the laborer,” and the work that we do, now over a hundred years later, when the reality of work has changed so much in our developing world?\\nIn the history of our Protestant tradition, Labor Day Sunday was often marked in churches by special services attended by labor organizations.  With much patriotic fervor, the painful struggle for the right to bargain for reasonable wages, hours and working conditions would be honored.  Hmmm…there is that stubbord “religion and politics issue” again!  Preachers would give thanks to God for the availability of honest work for all those who made the effort.  Underlying these celebrations was a common acceptance of the Protestant work ethic which decreed that to work and have wealth was a virtue.  It was assumed that if you did not find work and were poor, it must be your fault.  Failure to work was seen as sloth, a sign of moral depravity, or put theologically, a sign of sin.\\nA Labor Day Sunday sermon these days usually takes one of two directions regarding work:  The preacher can urge the congregation to discover their unique talents, as they consider how on all are given different functions for the common good, as part of the Body of Christ.  Or the sermon can exhort the gathered wider church to create a just society by lifting up labor concerns of right-to-work, equal pay issues, undocumented workers, living-wage and rising un-employment in our country, to name a few.   I believe either of these directions have their merit on our nation’s day of honoring labor.  \\nBut I am finding that our two scripture texts for today, from the Book of Exodus and from the Gospel of Matthew, are directing my thinking in a somewhat different direction than individual gift discernment or social justice issues around work.   The story of God’s dramatic self- revelation to Moses in the burning bush. The Gospel account of Jesus’ teachings about suffering. Both of these texts speak to of an underlying call to each of us that goes beyond job, daily tasks, employment, daily tasks.   This underlying interior call shapes a radical vision of the just society we call the Kingdom of God.   The call is from God and it is, ultimately about the “work that is real” for us as followers of the Risen Christ.  Not just as adherants to the principles of Jesus’ teachings, but followers, disciples of the spirit of the Living Jesus Christ in our midst.  I am sensing that in understanding this interior call, facing the challenges of its deeper purpose, we will be more discerning in the rest of our life choices around the work that we do.  \\n\\tLooking first at the Exodus passage, we encounter grown-up Moses.  He is a far cry from the story last week of an endangered baby who avoids Pharoah’s policy of infanticide to deal with his “Israelite problem.”  Rescued from the river Nile by Pharaoh’s daughter, Moses has been raised in Pharaoh’s household.  But he never forgot who he was, and he became increasingly distressed at the treatment of his enslaved people.  Moses ends up killing an Egyptian who has disciplined an Israelite slave with death.  Moses has now fled Egypt, and has been hiding in the wilderness, tending flocks for his new father-in-law in Midion.  One day, he encounters the bizarre spectacle of a bush that burns without being consumed. Moving closer, he hears God’s voice calling “Moses, Moses!”  Moses is understandably unnerved as God explains what Moses is to do, and squeaks: “who am I to go confront Pharaoh and gain the release of your captive people?”   God’s answer to Moses plaintive excuse? “I will be with you.”  “Who am I?”  says God.  “I am who I am” perhaps by way of saying “I am beyond names, I’m complete in my being.”  God also promises “I will be with you.”   I hear in this that our call as Christians, our work, is not all about us, and even matching our unique talents or experience with specific tasks.   It’s about God, about God being with us.  The long-standing Biblical theme of our co-partnership with God is emerging.   Not us doing everything all alone, not God doing it all for us.  According to Jesus, there are definitely consequences, even burdens, in being part of this co-partnership.  And, Jesus echoes God’s promise:  I will be with you in all of this.  This week, when some duty seems onerous or overwhelming, try this on:  “this is not all about me….God is with me.”\\n\\tMoses asks God:  “well, when I go to Pharaoh and tell him to let our people go, who should I say is sending me?  They will ask for your name; what do I tell them?”  And in the narrative God replies, “I am who I am….tell them ‘I am’ sent you.”  Many other places in the Bible we hear God defined as the One who does certain things.  Here, God defines Godself as simply being:  “I am who I am.”  This is interesting to consider when we live in a predominate culture like ours that values doing over simply being.  I think our relationship with work is complicated by the fact that most of us travel in circles where WHO we are depends on what we DO.  “What do you do?” we are asked upon meeting someone new, as the well-meaning person seeks to understand just who we are.  A problematic question if you have been laid-off….who am I if I am unemployed, under-employed, disabled and unable to work, or retired or home raising children or caring for frail elders or some other task our society subtly degrades as “unpaid labor.”   But God, who is known for being big on “doing,” creating and sustaining the universe and all that it is in it, here self-defines in terms of simply “being.”  How do we each self-define?  \\t\\n\\tAnother way to describe this theological terrain is to talk about ; God’s grace versus our works; what saves us at the end of the day in God’s eyes?   We’re going to constantly struggle with this, I think, because needs our “works!” “Works” pay the bills and take care of those we love and build a better world.   And works confer enormous prestige in our materialistic and competitive culture that values us by what we produce.   How might we, as Christians, speak to the value of those in our society who are unable, for whatever reason, to produce? This week, if you have no significant paid work to by which to define yourself, ponder the preciousness of your simply being.   “Whatever I do, or don’t do, I am a beloved child of God.”  And if you are terribly good at what you do out in the world, perhaps ponder that your preciousness in God’s sight is not all about your incredible productiveness!\\n\\tFinally, let’s turn to the Matthew passage where we find the disciple Peter again on center stage.  Peter is having to confront the reality that Jesus being the Messiah, and that being Jesus’ being a disciple, is going to be more difficult than he thought.   It will call each of them to a deeper level of challenge and change than they ever imagined.  They will be called to deny themselves, to suffer at some level that they had not anticipated.  Jesus declares that if they lose their lives for his sake they will gain their lives.\\n\\tTalking about self-denial and self-sacrifice is always tricky.   We probably all know people who have taken on a certain degree of martyrdom that only serves to perpetuate an abusive situation or allow a broader communal injustice to continue.   Or we take on “tiny crosses” to bear, as one commentator describes it,  and clean up someone else’s mess or quietly endure another boring meeting.  But loosing ourselves is probably letting go of those treasured habits, expectations, even desires that get in the way of our deeper connecting with God.  I believe this is the starting point of finding our “work that is real” in part because this is the real work of a Christian. Because there is a strange freedom and joy in loosing, in letting go of those parts of ourselves that our stumbling blocks to God working in us.  \\n\\tSo, we watch for the stumbling blocks in ourselves this week: overwhelmed with a task or thinking we are all on our own in the daily grind, we remember it is our partnership with God that defines us.  Delighted with our amazing productivity, we remember our preciousness is simply in being God’s child.  We look to where we are be called to let-go, to loose ourselves, even perhaps to suffer, for Jesus sake.   We are invited to “submerge in these tasks” as they will lead us to the real work of God’s realm.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinted on front page of worship bulletin,\\n“To Be of Use” – poem by Marge Piercy:\\n\\n“I want to be with people who submerge in the task,\\nWho go into the fields to harvest and work in a row and pass the bags along.\\nWho stand in the line and haul in their places,\\nWho are not parlor generals and field deserters\\nBut move in a common rhythm when the food must come in\\nOr the fire be put out.\\n\\nThe work of the world is common as mud.\\nBotched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.\\nBut the thing worth doing well done has a shape that satisfies,\\n   clean and evident.\\n\\nGreek amphoras for wine or oil,\\nHopi vases that held corn,\\nAre put in museums but you know they were\\n   made to be used.\\n\\nThe pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real.”\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tI noticed a lot of religious language flying around our nation’s Capital on Friday: God’s name, and that of Jesus, invoked repeatedly, admist our political transfer of power.   This is rather interesting given our concern over separation of church and state.  Hands laid on Bibles during the swearing in process.  Biblical references popping up in welcoming statements, prayers, choral music lyrics, and the presidential acceptance speech itself.   Especially prevalent was our Epiphany sesson language of light, light in darkness, light to the world.  \\n\\tI would say that when the Bible is referenced in the public square, we as Christians need to pay attention.  If we truly believe in the non-establishment of a particular religion, as described in our nation’s Constitution, we need to ask the truly patriotic question:  How is it that the images and rituals of Christianity have become normative in our public, political realm?  And what kind of Christianity is being referenced here?  I listened carefully to our new President.  As a nation, he said “We shine as an example to the world. “ Yes, I thought to myself, this makes Biblical sense.  “Be a light to the nations,” said the Hebrew prophets.  Not for special priviledge, but the world needs your example of a just and merciful society.  “You are the light of the world,” said Jesus, encouraging his disciples to live out the law of love and compassion.  \\n\\tBut then this statement in the President’s speech: “America always first!”  I thought to myself, Is that what being a shining light is about?   Perhaps we need to do a Biblical “fact check” asking ourselves:  Is this Biblical referencing true to what we understand about holy scripture? Does this ring true with what we know of the Hebrew texts, the Law and the prophets, that Jesus sought to fulfill?  Does it resonate with what we claim to be the message and ministry of Jesus?  \\n\\t“You are the salt of the earth.”  says Jesus in today’s text. “You are the light of the world.”   Be salt; be light.   All weekend I have been caught up in fast and furious text exchanges with my adult children, siblings, my mom and various nephews and nieces.  We watched the Inauguration; many of us were at marches from St. Paul, to Boston, Philadelphia to Washington DC.  My mom, at near 90, stayed glued to CNN, alternating between frustration that women’s and other marginalized groups’ rights still need marches, and her delight in seeing so many people affirming dignity and respect for all.   What does it mean to be “salt” in these times, I kept asking myself.  “What does it mean to be light.”  What does this mean, whoever we voted for, because we are certainly all in the same boat at this point, needing to move forward as a divided nation.\\n\\n\\tAs we encounter Jesus’ early ministry in these weeks after Christmas, we hear him insisting that the Kingdom of God, God’s realm of justice and peace, is at hand.  “You are the salt of the earth!” he announces to those gathered around him.  “You are the light of the world!”   “This is who you are.” \\n\\tHis audience, first century Jews, would have immediately heard the insider language here.   The Jewish prophets repeatedly reminded people of God’s call to be a light to the world, a beacon of justice and mercy that is so compelling to the other nations that it draws them into an awareness of God’s presence and power.  Here, Jesus adds a new metaphor that would again ring bells in their heads.  This precious mineral element was essential in the ancient world, seasoning and preserving food.  It had served as a ceremonial element in religions around the globe, and the ancient Middle East was no exception. According to Mark Kurlansky’s book Salt: A World History, by Jesus’ time, the human demand for salt had already formed special trade routes, was used as a ceremonial sign of Israel’s covenant with God, was sprinkled on burnt offerings made in the Temple in Jerusalem, and was a commodity controlled and taxed by the occupying Roman Empire.  Jesus wasn’t just telling his listeners to become like salt or to become like light and a light to the nations.  You are salt of the earth.  You are the light of the world.  It’s as if he is saying: this is who you are, O Israel, now BE that.  \\n\\tJust as we are God’s beloved, we are the salt of the earth, says Jesus.  Here to bring all kinds of enhancement and added taste to life around us.  Here to help preserve life, like salt had been used for ages.   Jesus wasn’t commanding people to try harder at this; it’s almost like a call to a different self-awareness, a change in consciousness.  Jesus is inviting them to see themselves differently, to take it in, ingest this reality.  Be yourself, he urges them!  Pour yourself out.   Salt, light…parts of the material world that are essential to life….come on, he urges, pour yourself out!\\n\\tA year ago today, you all willing poured yourself out to one another in this Sancutary.  It was during worship on a Sunday last January, when our Discovery Team talked about their interim work among you.   The Discovery Team, had eight members who worked with me to hold numerous forums listening groups to explore your history as a church, the ups and downs, and to help you identify your core values and beliefs, and discern a new vision for the church’s ministry.  In their final piece of work, they invited you into a new Covenant together.  This seemed to me to be an important step in truly being “salty” with one another, after a period of turmoil.  The covenant focused on behavior, on how you intended to BE with each other, from that day forward. \\n \\t“We will speak the truth in love,” you covenanted.  How this enhances relationships, not unlike a dose of salt to a stew!  Speaking up out of mutual respect: “I wasn’t comfortable when you said that.”  “I care that you are a part of us.”  “I’m frustrated this hasn’t been dealt with yet.”  “I’m sorry I said that.”  Truthtelling starting with the “I” – bringing out a depth of flavor in a relationship!  \\n\\tThe covenant also focused on celebrating each other’s gifts and perspectives.  Before refrigeration, salt was also used as a preservative.  Think of how relationships are stabilized, honored and preserved when we affirm each other’s inherent abilities and gifts!  Think of what it’s like to match people’s inherent gifts with certain tasks around the church, and not to guilt trip people into taking on a job or position that just doesn’t feel right?  Learning to say “no” when it doesn’t fit, and leaning enthusiastically into “yes” when the call matches our abilities and our yearnings!  You have been honoring one another’s gifts in new ways, inviting each other to work together to preserve the body of Christ in this place.\\n\\tAnd finally, the covenant focused on choosing “the good of the whole church over our individual preferences and comforts.”  Here is the ancient notion of salt as relationship, covenant affirmed.  You have increasingly been salt to one another as you have affirmed the higher good of your union as a congregation.  “Well, this action isn’t exactly what I would choose, but I’m okay with sayng yes and moving forward, for the good of the church.”   You are salty people, you are!\\nAnd now we are exploring how you will truly be a light to the nations, more specifically to this community.   In the march in st. Paul yesterday, there was a point when the crowd was moving and we finally had room to unfurl and display our wide Falcon Heights Church, United Church of Christ banner., I noticed how many people in around us pause to look at it and catch our eyes, smiling with encouagement. We know that the name “Falcon Heights” carries weight in the Twin cities, for better or worse, after the shooting death of Fernando Castille last July.  We were proud to say pubically that our congregation supports the rights of all people. I can’t tell you how many people have come up to me at recent hearings and panel discussions held here and in our City Hall, and said, “oh you’re from Falcon Heights Church, where the prayer vigil happened, those disucssions are happening.”  We are slowly beginning to be seen as a place of people coming together, or civil and respectful discourse about difficutl issues regarding race and community well-being.  \\nYou are a salty and light-filled people.  You are salting and spreading light in so many new ways, and I give thanks to God.   In these challenging and hopeful days, I am grateful to serve among you.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'Catherine Woodiwiss is a young author, known for her recent book on surviving personal trauma.  She wrote this week in the Sojourners Magazine website about the tension between Halloween and All Saint’s Day:  “Hallowe’en comes from All Hallow’s Eve,” she writes, “a Christian commemoration that, like Christmas Eve, introduces the feast day following.”  She goes on to explain that “the traditions around All Hallow’s Eve were originally adapted by the church from the pagan festival of Samhain (sow-ween), the Celtic day of the dead that historically involved summoning the (spirits of the) dead, dressing up in guises, and performing poems in exchange for food.”  Perhaps more poignantly, this darkening season was considered a “thin time” of the year, when the seeming distance  etween the living and the dead, the present and the great beyond, narrowed.  Celtic religious leaders would proclaim, through ritual of bonfires, sacrifices and prayer, the “death of death,” and with it, affirm the possibilities of new life in spring.  But eventually, these ancient traditions became a prelude for the day that followed, “a holy day to commemorate heroes and (heroines) of the faith.”  In recent years, as more people of Hispanic and Latino descent have become part of the multi-colored fabric of our own American culture, we’ve learned of a similar custom of celebrating “El Dia de los Muertos,” or  “Day of the Dead.”  Both a serious and festive time of telling stories about those who had died, visiting and tending family graves.  A day to acknowledge both dying and living, the cycle of life.  What struck me about Catherine Woodiwiss’ article was her recognition that for Christians, Halloween without All Saint’s Day is pretty, in her words, “anemic.  “Every year, this (All Saints’ Day) calls Christians to remember our context – to experience again the edges of our faith community as it stretches back (for generations) and forward into the unknowable future.”\\n\\tIn the broadest sense, All Saint’s Day is not meant as a celebration to honor perfect people, or even those who were martyred for the faith in grisly ways.  It is a “time to remember that all who claim the faith (not as intellectual belief, but more as trust in Jesus) – past, present and future – are part of the same body.”  The worldwide Body of Christ of which you and I are a part, together as both saints and as sinners. \\n\\tThe early evangelist, the Apostle Paul, who to call the first century Christians in his various letters “saints.”  Dear saints in Corinth!  Greetings, saints in Ephesus!  The word is “hagio” in Greek meaning “God’s holy ones.”  According to the Book of Acts, this is how early Christians referred to each other. Good morning, saints of Falcon Heights! The word was not meant to imply that all these people, including all of you, were holy as in perfect ,but that by association with God through Jesus Christ they were holy as in whole. Even with our propensity to makes mistakes, to miss the mark of who God intends us to be, to hurt others, to ignore God….to “sin” we would say theologically….We too are God’s holy and whole ones.\\n The veneration of saints, the hoarding of their bodily relics, and their canonization of later church history would seem very odd to these early Christians.  These first followers of Jesus would also wonder about our discomfort with the word sin and sinner.  Jesus understood sin to be our human propensity to “miss the mark” when it comes to treating one another as we would want to be treated.  The judgementalism and shaming associated with sin is simply not there in the teaching of Jesus.  \\nPerhaps we need to reclaim and re-examine both of these words, about saints and sinners, because they are powerful theological language about human life, about God, about the nature of evil and how we all interact together. God  calls each of us to not only to be accountable for our private transgressions.  God calls us to keep a keen eye on and prophetic voice speaking about the larger systemic sins of greed, inequality, oppression in the larger groups within which we participate: family, work environment, church, wider community, our planet.   This language of saint and sinner helps me face the paradox of my human condition.\\nI am always moved by the way our first hymn, “I sing a Song of the Saints of God” affirms, in a delightfully childlike language, that the Saints are all around us. Not perfect people, mind you, but people who are “patient, brave and true.”  All Saint’s Day is the time in the church year when we pause and remember those “saints” who have been among us.   We think about their patience, their bravery and truthfulness, and consider how we each might be more patient with each other and with ourselves, how we each might be braver in both our private lives and our wider public lives.  What is the truth we might need to speak this week?   Carry the words of this hymn with you this week, and see here God directs you: Patient, braver, true. \\nThe Bible is full of stories of saints and sinners; some were patient, brave and true, and some were impatient, cowardly and dishonest.  We heard the beginning of the story of Ruth from the Hebrew scriptures today, a poignant tale about foreigners in our midst, and how God might use those we least expect, least value, for God’s purposes.  The story centers on three women left with three dead husbands and no means of support.  It was written in the time of strict reforms imposed to purify Israel from forgeign influence, in the reigns of Kings Ezra and Nehemiah, after the return from Babylon captivity. In the midst of men being forced to cast off their foreign wives, this story became a strong critique of that xenophobic policy.  At this time, Jews and Moabites were bitter enemies.  After one daughter-in-law, understandably, decides to return to her own family of origin, the other daughter-in-law, a foreign Moabite, announces she will accompany her mother-in-law Naomi into a new religious life and uncertain future.  Confronted by terrible loss, and the transition loss demands, Naomi makes a courageous decision to return to the land of her Jewish ancestors.  Ruth, the Moabite foreigner who has married into the clan, asks to go with her. As the story unfolds, this tenacious commitment later leads Ruth and Naoimi to an unfamiliar place, where thru their care for one another, they find community support for both them. Ruth remarries, becomes a mother herself and part of the ancestral line which eventually leads to Israel’s great King David and finally to Jesus of Nazareth.   The story-writer is eager for us to know that it is Ruth’s faithfulness, with her decision which looks forward and not backward, that is so important.  I would say that the saints among us look forward, not backward to how things used to be, when the church or the nation supposidly “truly great.”  Who are the foreigners, the strangers in our midst that God might be working through in this age?  Because God does move forward.   \\n\\tSo on this day in late autumn we remember those saints, God’s holy ones, who have served God and the world through this church, and we celebrate their patience, bravery and truthfulness. Surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, we become aware of new things we are capable of doing and being as God’s whole and holy ones, saints and sinners, together.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIn hearing this scripture text from Matthew, we first need to address the inevitable “cringe factor” most of us just experienced.  If you found yourself wincing at some of the language about separating out sheep and goats, and the judgement which follows, you aren’t alone.  The Wednesday morning Bible study reacted in much the same way.  It reminded us all too feel of pious and pompous Church denuciations of people through ages, assigning them to eternal punishment for supposed moral transgressions.  What is Jesus saying here? The text describes in parable form a common assumption in ancient times: in the end times God will intervene in this messy world and make things right.  Some kind of final judgement.  “When the Son of Man comes in his glory,” begins Jesus, “and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of glory.”  The language is straight out of the Old Testament, the Hebrew scriptures that began to emerge during times of exile and suffering of the Jewish people, particularly as described in the visions of the prophet Daniel.  All the nations will gather around and the Son of Man (Son of the Human One) will “separate people from one another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”   Jesus slips into parable mode here and tell show the king will say to the sheep on his right hand that they are “blessed ones.”  They are the ones who have been faithful not necessarily in holding certain beliefs or affirming a creed, or doing specific religious ritural:  the blessed ones are the ones who have performed acts of loving kindness.  In a sense, these are the ones who have been living out the Kingdom, the Reign of God, that Jesus proclaimed:  unlike the Reign of Empire, they do not act out of self-interest with power-grabs and violence.  They bear witness to this “new Empire” ushered in by Jesus:  one in which the hungry, the thirsty, the naked, those imprisoned, are cared for and served.   Jesus talked a lot about God’s love for humans and forgiveness of human behavior.  But, apparently, Jesus believed there IS some kind of judgement connected with what we do!  But it wasn’t a judgement regarding our eternal destiny: our acts of compassion enable us to recognize Jesus.  What motivates our acts of loving kindness?  \\n\\tToday we focus on three areas of need which beg our acts of compassion and loving kindness:  world hunger and food insecurity, inadequate housing due to poverty and the growing needs of our elders.  I invite Sandy Casmey to begin these reflections for us, focused on hunger.   SANDY SPEAKS.\\n\\tFor Jesus, self-giving care of others was at the heart of his Jewish tradition, it was at the heart of the Torah, the Law, and it was at the heart of God’s reign breaking in among them.   Over and over, in his stories and in his interactions with people, Jesus enacts a certain sequence to this process.  In analyzing this pasaage, Alyce McKenzie, professor of preaching and worship at Perkins School of Theology in Dallas, notes that the sequence always starts with SEEING.  Jesus is continually described as noticing, acknowledging, truly seeing, people on the margins, people who were called cursed by his society, perhaps called malingerers or lazy,  stupid or immoral in our contemporary world.\\nThe father in the prodigal son story SEES his delingquent son in the distance.  Jesus SEES the woman crying because her son is sick, the man begging by the side of the road crippled by disability, the crowds hungry for spiritual teaching.  He has his eyes open.  How do we keep our eyes open, when so much of the suffering of the world sickens us and makes us feel so powerless?  Keep watching says Jesus, keep paying attention.  What news about suffering pops up for me most frequently?  What news do I avoid, turning the newspaper page away from the story, turning down the radio, clicking an internet link to something else.  For starters, something to notice this week:  in all the suffering of the world, near and far, what am I seeing?  What don’t I want to see?  There are some clues for each of us here.  First we have to see.  \\n\\tI invite Laura Martin to continue the testimony, focused on the human need for adequate shelter.  LAURA SPEAKS.\\n\\tAlyce McKenzie says that what happens after seeing is the rise of certain feelings.  And they can be a wild mix:  I hear the story of hundreds of Nigerian girls kidnapped, I attend a lecture on the increasing prevalence human sex-trafficking in Northern VA, and I feel disbelief.  I look and listen more closely and feel horrified, sickened, angry, sad…..powerless….hopeless.   I am sure Jesus felt all of these things as he confronted the suffering of his day.  And he also had this knack for not getting stuck in all this emotive swirl.  This can bind up our natural empathy as human beings.  All those studies with preschoolers about empathy?  It’s true; it’s a natural part of who we are; empathy for others has allowed us to evolve as humans.  Natural empathy get stifled by our assumptions that we can’t make a difference.  McKenzie says after seeing, we need to acknowledge the growing compassion within us that is natural to being human.  Compassion – feeling passion with someone.   Over and over, the Gospel texts describe how Jesus had compassion for others, and out of that compassion he acted.  Notice this week, among the swirl of feelings about human suffering, what is drawing both your attention and your compassion?\\n\\tI invite Bill Kirby to speak with us about the needs of our older generation, the elders in our community.  BILL SPEAKS.\\n\\tTwo things happen when we see, have compassion and finally act to help others.  The people in need get helped.  And we come to know Jesus. Today’s reading tells me that the “closet we come to a transformative face to face The judgment part?  I don’t think judgment is all a bad thing.  I want to be held accountable, in a compassionate but honest manner, for what I do and do not do.   As a universalist myself, I believe we are all held in God’s loving care, now and eternally. But when I die, I picture a moment when I come face to face with God.  I imagine that I will see my whole life, all I did and all I failed to do.  I will probably slap my forehead and exclaim, “oh, now I get it.  Yeah, you’re right.  Parts of this could have been different.”  And in some inexplicable way I will see God nod and smile with great compassion.   To truly see those in need, to let our natural compassion well up inside of us, and to respond with acts of loving kindness.  This is our challenge and our call as followers of Jesus.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tPerhaps this is your first time worshipping here, or maybe you haven’t joined us in awhile.  You are entering a conversation we are having about the shared Christian beliefs among us as a congregation. Many churches, and I would include this particular church, see Christianity “as a subplot to the story of (their) particular congregation.” As the UCC pastor and author Anthony Robinson bluntly states: “the stories of your particular church are not the content of the Christian faith.”  (Robinson, What’s Theology Got to Do with It?).  In asking you to articulate your own beliefs, The Discovery Team is working to guide a “clarifying of purpose” process between called pastors.  Their intent is not to devise a test of faith.  The invitation is to get clear about what is at the center of your life together as a congregation.  \\n “Bringing in more members and raising more money” is not the answer to “why” you are a church.  Neither is simply saying, “we are here to help others.”  What’s the purpose; what’s the why?\\n\\n\\tI am coming to see that people get involved and stay committed to a particular faith community these days because they know the why and agree with why you do it.  We usually want to describe to people what our church does (we meet the needs of all ages, we are open to everyone) and how we do it (we’re friendly, we have active children’s, teen and senior programs, we collect a lot of food for the needy).  But what in the world juices and drives all that activity?  Don’t leave it to the evangelicals to be the only ones to say:  this is about my experience of God acting in my life; about the transforming power of God’s love and forgiveness in my life, and my call to respond in service in Christ’s name.   \\n\\n\\tA liberal and progressive congregation like Falcon Heights Church has important theological things to say about why it does what it does.  And your church constitution is an articulate and powerful guide in this regard.  It affirms two general areas of belief:  First:  the belief that each member has “the freedom to interpret God’s Truth as God gives them each light and wisdom.”  But your constitution doesn’t stop there:  It continues that sentence: “this church recognizes and accepts as the basis of our common purpose, faith and covenant found in the Statement of Faith” of the United Church of Christ.  Your constitution affirms individual freedom, guided by God’s light and wisdom, not just your own rational perspective, to interpret God’s Truth.  And, your constitution affirms a shared sense of what that truth is.  \\n\\tWe are digging deeper into your “why,” that shared truth that unites you.  Today we move into this second section of that UCC Statement of Faith, which is included in the opening portion of the Falcon Heights Church Constitution, and talks about Jesus Christ.  I invite you to turn to the front of the bulletin, and let’s read it together.  Each of the words may not be exactly reflective of your particular beliefs, at this particular time, but I ask that we “try them on” together.  \\nIn Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth, our crucified and risen Savior,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0you have come to us\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and shared our common lot,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0conquering sin and death\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and reconciling the world to yourself.\\n\\n\\tNow take a look at the words on the paper hangings in the front of the Sanctuary:  Jesus Christ, man, Savior.  Crucified. Risen.   Pictures of the earth made by our children:  God, you have come to us.  The realm of mystery and otherness intersecting with our visible, physical world.  You have shared our common lot.  Here.  On Earth.  Conquering.  Reconciling.  More here than one sermon, for sure.  \\n\\n\\tAnthony B. Robinson suggests that the “who is Jesus” question includes both our understanding of his person and also of his work, what Jesus does to help us.  The early church spent a lot of time trying to figure out Jesus the person, with lots of debates, and church councils and formalized creeds swirling around this double identity of Jesus being both human and divine.  Then we have the whole reality of governing Empire becoming the decider about what was the correct view and what was heresy, which is in large part a complicated and horrific legacy we need to own and repent.  Again, another sermon!\\n\\n\\tRobinson suggests that it is these two Biblical stories, of Jesus’ baptism at the beginning of his ministry and his transfiguration in front of several disciples that can help us with this perplexing question of “who was Jesus?”  Think of a line, a continuum, with “Jesus was human” on one end, and “Jesus was divine” on the other.  It might be interesting to actually line ourselves up and see where we would all stand on that continuum.  Most liberal and progressive Protestant churches lean more heavily towards the human side, and speak of Jesus as being primarily a moral example and teacher.  Other traditions would line up more on the divine side.  \\n\\n\\tThat Jesus went to John the Baptist, who invited people to repent from their sins and be baptized, was a big problem in the first generations following Jesus’ death.  How could one who is also divine, and therefore sinless, feel the need to repent of his sins and be baptized?  Personally, I am not personally troubled by this, as in his humanness he must have had a sense of his own mistakes, his own sinfulness.  That John baptizes him, and that Jesus comes out of the waters of the River Jordan with an emerging sense of his public ministry, is okay with us in the more liberal church.  And this sentiment in echoed in those words “shared our common lot” in the Statement. We think of him as experiencing all the urges, temptations and challenges of human life, even if he did only have to deal with this until his early 30’s, never had a mortgage, didn’t have to raise teenagers or be a long-term marriage, as far as we can tell.  I would say that most of us here like our Jesus human; we get uncomfortable with this “Son of God,” “no one comes to the Father but through me,” virgin birth language, and are just not sure what to make of the resurrection accounts.  We like our Jesus human.  Yes, Example and Teacher! \\n\\n\\tAnthony Robinson has a few challenging things to say about this emphasis.   Seeing Jesus only as a good example and a teacher assumes that we need reminding that “life’s purpose is to love God and neighbor…the focus of this powerful teacher and inspiring example it to change our hearts and minds.  We need one who teaches us the pattern of the life God intends, and we need an inspiring example of selfless love” (What’s Theology Got to Do with It?)   But how is that working for us, here?  Are we ready to admit that we follow this example in this congregation?  Are people willing to admit that they have not acted out of selfless love sometimes and that hurtful things have been said through the years and especially in the recent past?  Is this church ready to admit that many people have kept quiet and allowed bullying to happen?  That some people continue to feel ignored or even shunned?  Ouch, yes.  This is about human sin.  Jesus teaches us “the pattern of the life God intends.”   Are we willing to really follow that example and those teachings?  That’s a tall order.\\n\\n\\tBut wait, I’m not even to Robinson’s most challenging statement yet!  “Perhaps not surprisingly,” he writes, this view of Jesus as Example and Teacher, “has had strong appeal among the more highly educated as well as those who place a high value on reason and rational understanding of religion…it may not fully address the human experience that is other than rational.  Even more seriously, this model underestimates the power and depth of human sin.”  Do we need more good advice, asks Robinson, or do we need Good News that our sinful choices can be acknowledged, confessed, repented and transformed?\\n\\n\\tBalancing out this view of Jesus’ humanness was the growing awareness, particularly by his followers after his resurrection, that Jesus somehow still lived among them, forgave them, loved them, guided them, changed them. \\nLanguage about divine savior and Lord, words used by the earliest of Christian communities, reflected their profound sense that Jesus, not Caesar, was their Savior and Lord.  Following the Risen Christ meant that they confronted not just their own individual mistakes and need for transformation.  They also were called to confront the corrupt political structures and injustices of their day.  They refused to proclaim that the Empire’s Caesar was their Savior and Lord.  They were called to be part of transforming the world under God’s reign of compassion, peace and restorative justice, by following Jesus, their Savior and Lord.\\n\\tAnd so the early Christians also claimed that Jesus, the Risen Christ, truly was divine in some mysterious way.  We don’t know if the Biblical story of Jesus transfigured gets read back into Jesus’ public ministry, or if it actually happened that way to those particular disciples.  Jesus’ face and figure taking on a visible radiance, the figures of Israel’s founding leader, Moses, and important prophet, Elijah, appearing at Jesus side.  All of this speaking to a mind-blowing sense that Jesus was somehow….yes….divine as well as human.  And those of us in this 21st century are left to grapple with all these titles:  Savior, conqueror, Lord, Messiah, anointed one, Christ.  \\n\\n\\t“Shared our common lot,” says our Statement of Faith.  This is described as a deed of God.  “We believe in you, O God, Eternal Spirit, God of our Savior Jesus Christ and our God, and to your deeds we testify,” we read last week.  This is listed as a deed, a doing, of God.  “In Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth, our crucified and risen Savior, you have come to us and shared out common lot.”  This is the stuff of incarnation.  Or, as Robinson puts it, a God who “risked full entry into our lives….by embracing humanity and by sharing it with us…Are our doubts (about this) a form of self-protection” from the God who yearns to be fully involved in our lives and who would change us by that involvement? \\n\\n\\tLet’s continue the conversation about how God is revealing God’s Truth to you.  Come join me after worship, as we talk together about our beliefs about Jesus.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'We are not sure just who was the target for this teaching parable that seems to be about humility.  The Gospel writer Luke records that “Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves,” but no one is named.  But isn’t it a good thing to be able to trust yourself?  To be able to have confidence in how we will act in public, and not fall prey to whim or sudden urgings?  “To some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous,” says the text.  But, what is the problem with this?  It doesn’t say self-righteous.  To be “righteous” for a first century Jew (Jesus’ primary audience) meant that you were acting with integrity in your relationship with God and with others, doing justice and walking humbly before your God.  Not a bad thing, to be “righteous.”  So, what is the problem with these “some” Jesus is talking to?  Here it comes:  “they were righteous and regarded others with contempt.” \\nAre any of us, the 21st century audience, in the picture yet?   Who among us hasn’t quietly held someone in contempt this week?  Silent distain as we see or hear of someone else acting pompous or lazy or irrational or wasteful or too evangelical.  Dear God, thank you that I am not like…..fill in the blank.  An especially tempting thing to do on Reformation Sunday:  Dear God, thank you that I am part of a Protestant church that celebrates individual freedom and autonomy, diversity of belief…….not like those other churches!\\n       Jesus has his listeners’ attention now.  He proceeds to tell a tale of a respected religious leader, a Pharisee.  In the story, the Pharisee simply offers thanks to God that he is not like certain other people.  Unlike us, Jesus’ 1st century listeners would be rooting for the Pharisee at this point.  Pharisees were highly respected as thoughtful religious reformers of their time.  Their goal was to relate the Law more liberally and more closely to everyday spirituality and people’s circumstances.  It was only later in the first century, when the relationships between the Jewish synagogues and new Christian communities were getting tense over different interpretation of the Law and the meaning of Jesus, that “Pharisee” starts being seen in a negative way. \\nThe Pharisee is doing all the right and righteous things, and is sharing these with God in a private prayer “standing by himself.”  “I fast, I give a large portion of my income to the needy.”   “Wow, what an admirable person,” Jesus’ audience is probably saying to themselves.  Jesus then introduces the tax collector; everyone assumes this will be the villain in the story.  In that time, tax collectors were despised collaborators with the occupying Roman rulers.  “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” the tax collector cries.  And surprise, surprise, it is this man, speaking in dejected humility, who Jesus says is truly justified and accepted by God.   \\nAgain Jesus surprises his listeners out of their everyday way of valuing behavior and worth.   Think of how often we thank God in our prayers for all the blessings that come our way, often our good works that make for bounty.  And we begin to lean into our capacities, our productiveness, our upstandingness.  We may measure ourselves against others’ accomplishments.  We become wary and even contemptuous of those unable to fend for themselves in our current economy.  Reassured by our capabilities, we might insist we don’t have much need for God’s help.  “It’s okay God, I’ve got it covered,” we may find ourselves praying; ever more trusting in our own self-sufficiency.   Not unlike the Pharisee, we get it about what kind of righteous life to lead….and we all become forgetful about the source of that righteous life – God.  The Pharisee prays to God, but has lost sight of his dependence on God.\\nYou may have noticed that the tax collector never actually repents in the story.  He doesn’t confess he has been excessive in his taxation of the locals, so he can profit.  But he starts in a place that most of us would like to avoid:  he acknowledges his total dependence on God.  And I think this idea makes most of us capable folks squirm.\\nMartin Luther’s challenge to the corrupt religious practices of the 16th century speaks to the parable’s purpose:  to assume God’s love for us rests on our purchased indulgences, our abilities or character, even our beliefs, means we are lost.  It’s all grace; it’s all God’s initiative. The tax collector gets it: he simply presents himself humbly to God’s merciful presence, which is there for us always.  We might think the story is about being humble, when actually its not about us being one thing or the other.  It’s not about us.  It’s about God.  It’s about God’s persistent insistence that we are loveable and redeemable and reformable all at the same time. \\nWhen we share about our beliefs in the listening groups in a few minutes, we are not trying to find the “right” or “correct” belief, or draw a line around the perimeter of our church with a test of faith.  We will simply be testifying to what we have come to trust beyond ourselves.  Jesus “told this parable to some who trusted in themselves.”  What do you believe, what do you trust beyond yourself?  We will use the UCC Statement of Faith, which is not a test but a testimony to faith used by our wider church since it’s formation in late 1950’s.  The statement has been reformed itself, with this most recent version using inclusive language referencing God and humans.  It is written in the form of a prayer of praise to God.  As we read it together, I invite you to notice which of the phrases resonate in a meaningful way for you; what can you trust in the statement?  Which of the phrases are problematic, confusing or uncomfortable for you?  Notice how you feel as you pray this prayer to God, along with the voices of the rest of us in this Sanctuary.  Will you join me in praying together?  (Statement of Faith)\\n \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThere is a unspoken agreement among most ministers: We think that Jesus had it easy.  This may sound rather startling, or even presumptuous.  But when you get a bunch of clergy-types together, and they invariably start talking about the ups and downs of leading local congregations, Jesus’ everyday ministerial duties look pretty appealing. As an itinerant preacher/teacher/healer, he had a new group of people to talk with every few days, no budgets to debate, no buildings to repair, no difficult Board meetings.  And think of it: no hospital visits because you cure people on the spot!  There were certainly times when Jesus was drained and physically exhausted from his ministry.  But what is missing in Jesus’ work is this very human and fallible institution as we know it today, called “the church.”   Hmmmm,  we ministers think to ourselves….maybe we should all just get spiritual and leave this religious institution stuff behind us!  \\n\\tBut then, darn it, I start reading the Bible again and I am reminded of the great cloud of witnesses that have gone on before us, and the communities of alive people that I am drawn to.  And I remember that it is all about people sharing this experience of the living God with one another and struggling to create ways to live out that experience together.  I read Luke’s account of Jesus’ private spiritual encounter in the desert, filled with temptations to power and glory.  But I am sharply reminded that he doesn’t keep this personal encounter with the divine to himself.  In our text today, Jesus has already returned to his hometown, joining his family and neighbors in worship at their local synagogue.   The time of prayers, singing and Hebrew scripture would have been lay led, with the community’s men stepping forward to read from the scrolls.  Jesus stands and is handed the reading for the day, this portion from the prophet Isaiah:  \\n\\tThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.\\n\\tBy this time in Jewish tradition, these words had been connected to the community’s expectation of the Messiah who would come and transform Israel.  After he has finished reading, Jesus sits down among them.  Without him saying a word more, people know something is up.  All eyes are fixed on him.  From where he is seated, Jesus simply says: Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.  Sounds rather innocuous to us perhaps, but after a few moments, all hell breaks loose.  Jesus starts describing how freeing and healing people is going to challenge the community’s insider status and their neglect of the marginalized in their midst.   And as we will read next week, those in the synagogue are so scandalized by his words that they will chase out of his hometown and try to throw him over a cliff.  Yet another religious institutions at its worst; let’s just be spiritual, okay?\\n\\tOne Biblical commentator on this passages suggests: Note that Jesus reads from their own (his own) Scriptures, which is to suggest that the Bible is both the greatest friend and the greatest enemy of the community of faith. Everything that would challenge us most deeply is right here, right there, in this odd, disordered and difficult book, a book that reads us as much as we read it.  (Anthony Robinson, 1/27/13 lectionary web-blog).\\n\\tPart of what happens to us in religious community is that we allow something bigger than ourselves to “read us.”  Something wider than our own individual insight, even larger than our own collective perspective as a group.  We allow the faith tradition, other congregations, a wider denomination, and a very old book called the Bible, to “read us as much as we read it.”   The Bible becomes both “friend and enemy” to us as individuals and to us as a congregation.  Because the Biblical message has this tenacious way of fulfilling itself as we hear it.  It works in us, if we let it.  \\n\\tTake this passage from the apostle Paul we just heard; a snippet of a letter that he wrote to one of the congregations he started in southern Greece around the middle of the first century.  Having encountered the risen Jesus Christ in a vision, this Greek-speaking Jewish Pharisee gets busy spreading the Good News of new life through the Spirit.  This church in the busy, prosperous and diverse city of Corinth is apparently growing and is filled with conflict.  Groups of people, from various ethnic backgrounds and social classes in the city, would come together regularly in one of their larger homes, for a common meal and worship.   At this point, the word church, or in Greek ekklesia, means simply “a people called” or “the visible assembly.”  It’s about the community for them, the people who are responding to God’s call in Jesus Christ.   And apparently, this “visible assembly” was a mess.  Grumbling and infighting, rival groups trying to gain control.  A reluctance to hold some people accountable for flagrant immorality.  And the less prominent among them, those of lesser means, had been marginalized and ignored.  \\n\\tGood gracious, we might wonder.  If the early church got in trouble so quickly, is that just the way it is going to be for churches?  What does it mean to “be church” in this day and age, when so much church history, and people’s experiences in congregations, can be so difficult?  A good question to consider in light of our Annual Meeting today, when we reflect on this last year and look forward into the next.       \\n\\t\\tHere is where I find the Bible reading me, reading us, today:  here in Paul’s image of the church as the Body of Christ.  In ancient times, the image of the corporate Body was often used to substantiate hierarchies and establish the lowliness of certain classes of people.  But Paul uses the body metaphor to decribe our equality and unity “in Christ” as a follower of the Risen Jesus, and the necessity of all of us for the work of the Gospel.  There can be some comfort in this, as we sink into the love and support of a community.  But this is also incredibly challenging, given our predominant cultural notions of rugged individualism.  In being church together, “the Body of Christ,” we are admitting a communal dependence, bearing each other’s joys and sufferings.  We are fulfilling God’s vision for humanity by hanging in there together.   We are not God’s sons and daughters alone.  This is where “spiritual but not religious” just doesn’t cut it for me.  I don’t follow Jesus by myself, just from my own individual perspective and experience.  As Lillian Daniel, United Church of Christ minister of a church outside of Chicago has written in her new book “When Spiritual But not Religious Isn’t Enough.”  Church, Daniel describes, is where we “step out of ourselves, dare to become a community, and encounter a God greater than we could ever invent.”\\n              A club of people is connected to one another because of a shared\\nsense of preferences, which develop a common purpose and shared tasks.   But a church community is connected together in a different way.  We all have different preferences, because any church is invariably filled with different kinds of people, some of whom we might not naturally rub shoulders with in our weekday world.   It’s our unity in diversity that is so important, and such a powerful witness to the world.  We are drawn together as we experience in worship, fellowship and service, the welcome of other humans and God’s extravagant welcome of us.  In that welcome, by the gathered Body of Christ, we slowly begin to experience the transforming power of God.  Self-judgment and competition softens, we let down our armor a bit, and we start to connect.    \\n\\t\\tThis community is where all of us, the weak and the strong alike, come week after week to get re-oriented, re-formed, given fresh eyes to see God’s world.  Where we develop the perspective and the renewed energy to go out and be part of the freeing and healing of the world around us.  And so it is for us, the Body of Christ.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tJesus feeding 5000 people from a young boy’s lunch.  Jesus walking out across the heaving waves on an inland sea in the middle of a windstorm.  Yes, Biblical miracles are difficult to talk about.  They strain our thinking, for one thing.  Our scientific worldview gets challenged when we are confronted with stories of extra-ordinary things happening, in the Bible or in our daily lives.  What we would call a “premodern” mind might be impressed, even convinced of God’s existence and Jesus’ power, by such stories.  But the part of us that wants to observe and measure and calculate and prove, is not sure what to do with miracles…if they even exist at all.  \\n\\n\\tThe Bible is full of miraculous stories that seem to strain the brain: Red Seas parting to allow a rag-tag group of Jewish slaves to escape the Egyptian army. Women conceiving and bearing children in their 80’s and 90’s, or stranger still, pregnancy without sex.  God talking out of a burning bush, a cloud of smoke, a flaming pillar. Jesus of Nazareth turning water into wine, walking on water, healing sick people, bringing the dead back to life, coming back from the dead himself.  I tell you, these recorded events are a puzzlement to many of us.  Events and acts that defy the laws of physics as we know them, and leave us wondering “Do I have to believe these miracles happened to be a Christian.  Is my relationship with God a sham, is my faith, inferior if I don’t’ believe these stories to be literal descriptions of something that happened?  Are these stories in any sense true?”\\n\\n\\tIt is difficult for us to understand how people viewed the world 2000 years ago in Jesus time and further back before him.    Imagine living in a world where “nature” is not a closed system that God has to somehow “interrupt” supernaturally to make anything happen.  Imagine a world that simply functions each day because God wills it to be so and is active within that world in every moment.   God’s extraordinary and extravagant actions happening each day, in each interaction with other humans, animals, plants, the whole of creation.  All suffused in the mystery of God’s workings.   Like the moisture-filled thickness we feel on a hot humid summer day, for people in Bible times, the air was thick with God.  Life was permeated with the spirit world, with forces of good and evil, full of angelic hosts and God’s glory.  Strange and difficult for us to imagine.   \\n\\n\\tBut miracles weren’t really surprising to first century people; in Jesus’ time there were lots of healers and wonder workers.   The crowds didn’t view this as God intervening from outside their rationally ordered world.  They already experienced that “earth is crammed with heaven” like the British poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning would later describe to her Enlightenment focused world.  What was new with Jesus was how he used miracles to help people better understand the heart of God. The Kingdom of God does not work like the Kingdom of the Empire, where power and money, appearance and possessions, strength and violence, rule the day.   For Jesus, this Kingdom of God, God’s reign, is like this….like these happenings in these ordinary parts of life:  wheat, weeds, mustard seeds, yeast, a young boy’s sack lunch.  \\n\\n\\tThis story of feeding many with little is the only story of Jesus to appear in all four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; clearly an important part of the oral tradition of stories of Jesus’ ministry that circulated before anyone wrote them down.  Why mention this particular scene?  Somehow, the Gospel writers each understood that this event was a picture of God’s reign.  It showed God’s reign as a place where small things bring big changes; where God’s economy, way of dealing with the world, is one of abundant compassion, not scarcity and punitive judgment.\\n\\n\\tCrowds of people had been following Jesus, records the Gospel writer John.  We can sense their yearning,  desperation even, in how they clamored after Jesus.  This may seem a bit off-putting to us.  Perhaps its hard for us self-sufficient types to admit that level of need.  They “saw the signs that Jesus was doing for the sick.”  They crowd around him as he teaches, 5000 men, probably twice that many women and children.   Everyone seems to have lost track of the time, but Jesus turns to his disciples and asks:  “what are we going to do about getting these people some food to eat?”  “Yikes,” replies one of the disciples, “we just don’t have enough money for a project like that!”  Another disciple speaks up, maybe even sarcastically:  “Hey, this kid has some barley loaves and a few dried fish.  Use that!  But, what are they among so many people?  This won’t make any difference!”\\n\\n\\tOne commentator (Trygve Johnson, Chaplain at Hope College in Michigan) blogging about this story notes that so often we see a situation of need and we feel like we have nothing to give.  We assume we have nothing of worth to share, or we have so little that it seems ridiculous.  Other people have more talent, or more money, or more faith than we do.  Ours looks like just a pittance.  Why bother?   Yet God seems bent on giving by multiplying what little we have.  “Bring your nothing to me.  Be part of this. Come on now, get the people to sit down,” says Jesus.\\n\\n\\tWe want to focus on the scarcity, and our worry that there will be even less in the future.  Too little in the church bank account, too few young families, too little energy around here.  Over and over the Biblical message is that this is a God of abundance, and this God wants to multiply what we have.  “Bring your nothing to me,” says Jesus.  The disciples are asked to participate in the miracle, one where there will be not only enough for all these thousands of people, but there will a dozen huge baskets left over.  I’m not sure I believe this story in the same way I believe in the existence of something quantifiable, like this piece of paper or the law of gravity.  But I am coming to trust in this story of God’s incredible abundance and generosity.\\n\\n\\tSometimes we stand in the presence of a miracle unfolding in front of us.  Something starts to shift inside of us, but we aren’t sure how to respond. Maybe a person starts to change or a situation takes an unexpected turn, new life is happening in front of us…. but we just freeze.  We can’t seem to find the way in; we can’t connect.  “But what are they among so many?” we wonder.  \\n\\n\\tEugene Peterson, long-time local church pastor and author, describes this happening to him when his son announced that his young wife was pregnant with Peterson’s first grandchild.  Eugene and his wife jumped in the car and went to visit the young couple; his wife Jan was brimming with joy and expectation of this miracle of new life.   But Eugene felt oddly out-of-it.  Dull and flat.  As they drove home, he complained to Jan about his lack of emotion.  He even felt a bit irritated at her obvious excess of delight.  “What’s wrong with me:  Why don’t I feel anything? “ he demanded.  His wife answered, “perhaps it’s because you’ve never been pregnant.”  “Well, that’s just great; so what am I going to do about that?” he snapped.   His wife replied, “I suggest you build a cradle.”\\n\\n\\tAfter mulling this idea around in his minds for a few days, Eugene trudged down to the public library and found pictures of cradles.  He chose an early American hooded cradle design, sketching the plans, going to a specialty wood shop.   In between pastoral calls and sermon writing, he would work on the cradle.  Measuring, cutting the wood, bit by bit.  When it was assembled he sanded over and over with the finest sand paper and steel wool, in-between applying coat after coat of tung oil.  And as he held that cradle and shaped and rubbed it, he found himself imagining the little baby growing inside his daughter-in-law. He found himself praying in wonder and gratitude for this developing child.  And he realized his wife’s suggestion had worked:  he himself felt pregnant with expectation and excitement!   That was a miracle in itself!  He went from numb and uninvolved to being pregnant with anticipation and hope.  And by the time the cradle was ready, he was ready to fully receive that miracle of a new life (from Eugene H. Peterson, The Pastor: A Memoir).\\n\\n\\tI suspect that miracles are strewn at our feet everyday, mostly located in small insignificant things.  We trip over them, unnoticing.  Of we stumble into them and don’t know how to respond.  God’s miraculous actions fill the air like thick humidity.   “I have nothing to contribute to this particular situation,” we groan.  “Bring me your nothing,” says Jesus.  “Get the people to sit down.  I need you all to participate here,” says the God of the Universe.  “Let’s see what we can do with your nothing.  Let’s turn it into a miracle of hope and compassion.”   \\n\\n\\tWatch this week.  This world is thick with the God who invites us to participate in miracles.   Step right up; bring what little you have.  Watch it multiply!  Amen.\\n\\t\\n(Cradle story from: Eugene H. Peterson, Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places: Conversations in Spiritual Theology.)',\n",
       " '\\tOur reading from John’s gospel brings us a celebratory, joyous story of about a wedding feast.  And who doesn’t like a great, big wedding reception?  Well, we all know it can be a tense time for whoever is paying for the bash; formal wear tends to feel constricting, neckties and highheels and such.  And relationships with the in-laws may feel prickly.   A few family members may still be fuming that the wedding ceremony was held on the beach or all places. Or that it incorporated elements from some other spiritual tradition.   Or that there were two brides instead of a bride and a groom for goodness sake!  Not to mention that at many receptions, somebody invariably drinks to much.  But usually, we all hang in there for an afternoon or evening of feasting and dancing, delighting in the couples love-glow and having a roaring good time.  And thank goodness, that most of our wedding receptions don’t go on for a week like they did in Jesus’ time.   Seems so over-the-top!\\n\\tFor some reason, the gospel writer John frames Jesus first public action with the context of an over-the-top wedding feast story.  It’s a rough beginning for us, as 21 century people, as it is easy to get stuck on the miracle question as we weave our way through the text.  Did it really happen like that?  Six huge 20-30 gallon jars of water turned into wine?  Even a cup of water shape-shifting into wine throws off our scientific sensibilities. Matter just doesn’t spontaneously change like that, according to our current laws of physics.  Unless of course we are replicating beverages on the Starship Enterprise, as suggested in the TV series Star Trek somewhere in the future.  But for now, we may struggle with whether or not this is literal or symbolic language.  Whatever it is, this story is John’s introduction to the public ministry and works of Jesus.  It is the inaugural story that John tells us about Jesus.  In the midst of a wedding celebration Jesus works a sign of such over-the-top extravagance that his disciples believe in him.  \\nBut what does the sign, this miracle, point to and what does it mean?  Just what do the disciples end up believing about him?   That Jesus, whoa, now THERE is one amazing wine-maker!? What does the Gospel writer hope will happen in us as we hear the story?  What’s the invitation here and how might we respond?\\n\\tWhen we are faced with a thorny Biblical story, it helps to consider the context in which we are encountering the narrative.  First, we hear it with some perspective on the author’s context: a late first century church where the struggle between new Jewish and Greek followers of Jesus, and the wider Jewish community that did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, was intensifying.  And we may bring our past awareness of the story with us, if we have heard it before. Now, such stories may irritate or hook us, make it hard to get at what the Gospel writer is really doing.  We also hear today’s story with the wider context of a current Inaugural celebration happening this weekend and the swearing in of our re-elected President for a second term tomorrow.   If we are citizens, however we voted, there is general assumption and civic agreement that we get on board with our re-elected leader.  That we get down to work together on bringing renewal, reduced violence, even peace, justice and mutually shared prosperity, to our country and the wider world.  That we do this respectfully and with open-mindedness.  And we attempt to move forward even as we commemorate the birthday of Martin Luther King Junior and acknowledging that we still have tremendous challenges ahead in addressing the racism and poverty he so deplored.  A tall order in our sharply divided nation. But even with our cynicism and despair over current public rancor, that is our hope and intention.   Might we be hearing today’s Biblical texts with ears attuned to new beginnings, a new era where these values, the values of God’s reign of peace and justice, are freshly embraced and fulfilled?  \\n \\tJohn’s story of a marriage feast and abundant wine draws on ancient Biblical symbols of the joyous arrival of God’s reign among the people.  For all that has happened in the last weeks, from school shootings to vitriolic debate about reducing gun violence to the news of a hostage massacre in Alegria, the Biblical word remains among us:  God is hughly generous and God’s reign of extragence is breaking in upon us.   As the prophet Isaiah describes it, where once the Jewish nation was called “Forsaken” and “Desolate,” they will now be called God’s “Delight” and their land will be called “Married.”  Are these Biblical writers dense?  Their historical era was no picnic. Weren’t they aware of the violence and poverty and suffering all around them?  \\n\\tJesus, his mother and some of his early followers are at this wedding.  And this is day three of feasting and drinking.  Jesus was known for enjoying a good party.  This story may bring us equal amounts of the human Jesus, as well as his divine powers and glory.  Actually, John starts by telling us Jesus’ mother was there, which is a curious detail.  But she will be one of the few faithful disciples John describes as being at the foot of the cross when Jesus is executed.  Here she is named only as his mother, but her attention to detail jump-starts the story of his public ministry.  Even before the wine-steward has spoken to the party host, the bridegroom, Mary is on to it.  Pulling Jesus aside, she whispers, “they have no wine.”  His reply sounds harsh, but in the original tongue of Aramaic it not rudeness but neutral disengagement.  “Woman, of what concern is that to you and me?  My hour has not yet come.”  Bells would go off in John’s early readers with this word:  “hour.”  Like marriage feasts and good wine, “the hour” was a common Jewish metaphor of escatological fulfillment.  The future end time when God’s justice would rule the world in peace and well-being for all.   “Not yet,” Jesus is saying.  Is he reluctant, or just being timely, according to God’s plan?  We don’t know.  But what happens next is that the faithful disciple, his mother, initiates a subtle protest and a blatant nudge.  She turns to the servers, saying: “do whatever he tells you.”   I love this part.  Maybe part of what we are to do as followers is to trust that God wants our joy and delight, symbolized by the wine.  Are we all called to sometimes protest and to nudge God?  \\n\\tSix big stone containers, 20-30 gallons each, used for Jewish rites of washing and purification.  All empty.  Is John symbolically telling us there is  emptiness in the religious practice of the day?  That something new needs to be added?  Notice how the details start to go over the top.  “Fill the jars with water,” Jesus directs the servants.  This is a massive amount of liquid. “And draw them out and take them to the chief steward.”  Which they do, and the oblivious guests are quite pleased because the wine is delicious.  The chief steward gets stuck where we do, trying to come up for a reason that explains the miracle of this tremendous vintage (he has got to know the wine ran-out):  “oh, I get it, you are SUCH a generous bridegroom, you have saved the best for last!  How wonderful!”  Actually, it is Jesus who is the new bridgegroom, coming to marry and fulfill humanity.  Only Jesus disciples, his mother and these other unnamed followers get it.  This sign, says John, is to reveal God’s glory and the breaking in of God’s reign.  And Jesus is the one who reveals this.  This is the one.  And the disciples believe it. \\nThe Biblical narrative challenges us with a vision of God’s forward motion in the history, God’s call to action to each of us.  And our call to keep talking with God, protesting to God amidst the brokenness of our world.  Like Mary bugging Jesus, to keep nudging God.  In these weeks of both disturbing news and renewed beginnnings for our country, I resonate with the Psalmist declaration that God’s steadfast love brings the people into an abundant feast where they “drink from the river of (God’s) delights.”  As Isaiah reminds us, and all shall be joined together again, our land “married.”  Jesus gallon creates over 150 gallons of wine: an extravagant almost senseless abundance.  Not unlike the pouring into Washington this week of people to witness this Inauguration and celebrate with together optimistic hopefulness.   But any vision worthy of God’s purposes is filled with the spilling over of both compassion and joy. How we might share God’s delight, God’s hope in us, with others?  For this challenge and this ministry, thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",

I was a self-avowed atheist in middle school, and told my mother I would not be participating in our congregation’s confirmation class.  “Well young lady,” my sly mother replied, “I think you should be able to explain why you are an atheist, so you will be attending the class.”  And I did, and in spite of the fact that I “drew a circle to “shut (my congregation) out,” and chose not to be confirmed at that point, my pastor “had the wit to win” and “drew a circle that took (me) in.”  \\n\\t\\tIn identifying “inclusive” and “inclusivity” as a value in this congregation, I sense you are doing much the same thing.  Many of you have told me that you seek to draw a wide circle, especially for people who have experienced non-inclusion, even overt rejection, in other churches or religious traditions.  Diversity of theological views has been important since the founding of this church and is outlined in your church Constitution as “freedom to interpret God’s Truth as God gives each of (you) light and wisdom.” For many of you, racial, political, sexual orientation and economic inclusivity are critical components to your vitality as a congregation.  One would hope that your inclusivity in all of those regards would have no limits.  To always have the love and wit to draw the larger circle that includes all people:  this is a profound vision and a tender hope for many churches.\\n\\t\\tBut when I chose Markham’s poem to print on the front of our worship bulletin today, it was over a week ago.  It was before I left of vacation on the West coast, and days before Wednesday night’s shootings in Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The awful irony for me is that this AME Bible Study group, in which an elected state official was assassinated and eight other African American people were murdered, also “drew a circle that took him in,” as the poem describes.  They didn’t know the young, quiet white man who asked to be part of their mid-week study group; he was a stranger in their midst. He was welcomed into the circle of conversation, scripture reading and prayer.  He sat with them for an hour, before beginning to spout his racist accusations about blacks raping women and taking over the country, and finally pulling out a gun and shooting.  All in a faith community, the place where any of us, and I would say particularly for African Americans in this country, hope to feel most welcomed, most safe, most included.  And within a particular faith community, a church founded by those who planned a slave revolt in the early 1800’s and that local whites later burned to the group.  This church has been a potent symbol of the struggle with discrimination and violence against blacks in our country.   It seem hardly a random choice by someone intent on a hate-driven act meant to intimidate and terrorize the wider African American community.  There, a circle of inclusion shattered by an act of terrorism made possible by the realities of ongoing racism, increasingly popular white supremism, and escalating gun violence.  How do we understand the value of inclusion, of inclusivity, in a world where some ideas, some prejudices, anti-Gospel values, should NOT be made welcome?\\n\\t\\tToday we are exploring the value of inclusion, of inclusivity as it relates to our congregation.  So much of Christianity has been defined by who and what the Church as a dominant power has excluded:  Jews from full citizenship, women from leadership, people of color from the building, the LGBT community from being who they are and loving who they love.  I rejoice that our wider denomination, of which this church is part, has a history of inclusive “firsts.”  We are the first Protestant denomination to ordain an African American pastor in in 1785, a woman pastor in 1853 and a gay pastor in 1972.   \\n\\t\\tJesus was constantly reaching out to those who were excluded in his culture.  Lepers, women, those who worked directly with the occupying Romans, those deemed sinners by his own Jewish tradition.  He was always moving “out front” on this inclusion of the marginalized and rejected.  And frankly that, is where the ideal of being inclusive may be hardest for us.  It is very difficult to truly embrace the wide diversity of people that cross our paths these days.  While those in younger generations find increasing diversity in the workplace and in their children’s schools to be the norm, this has not been so for previous generations.  Older generations, in congregations I have served, usually experienced young adulthood and family-raising during a time when Christianity was the assumed norm in our communities.  These post World War II years were defined by a sense of civic cohesiveness, nuclear families with stay-at-home moms and working dads.  Most everyone at the grocery, at work, at schools or department stores, at church, looked like you, and celebrated the same holidays as you.  To be part of a congregation that is more vocally inclusive of people different than one’s own family or the people we socialize with can feel  challenging.   I have served churches that did not want to perform same-gender weddings for fear of becoming the “gay church,” whatever that was supposed to mean.  And I am aware that people have left this Opening and Affirming Congregation due to negative comments about gay and lesbian people, overhead in the restroom and even spoken face-to-face.  Hard to hear, isn’t it?   A certain pride, and insistence on “color blindness” may be expressed in a congregation that includes a few people of color.  But seriously exploring one’s own privilege as a white person, as was the topic of our Minnesota Conference Annual meeting last week, is much more daunting.   Hearing the news about Charleston and having to face our own quiet complicity in a nation that continues to tolerate harassment, discrimination and violence towards people of color is very disturbing and perplexing.  Such are the challenges of saying:  we value inclusivity. \\n\\t\\tAs I hear Jesus words from the Gospel of Mark, I am struck by his willingness to approach Levi, a man working in his tax booth collecting taxes for the Roman Empire.  This was considered an “unclean” profession by the Jewish community, where one would be ritually impure because of his work with the occupying Gentile army and contact with this person would make you “unclean.”  Jesus continues pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable by eating at Levi’s house, along with other tax collectors and sinners.  All very inclusive and this gravely troubles the holy law scholars, the Pharisees.  But the manner in which Jesus replies has an exclusive ring to it that we may find a bit surprising.  “Why do you eat with these people and make yourself ritually unfit?” the Pharisees ask.  Jesus replies that he hasn’t come for those who are in no need of a “physician.”  “I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”  I am reminded of other places where our inclusive Jesus sounds increasingly exclusive:  no one enters, participates in the Kingdom of Heaven, God’s reign of justice and compassion on earth, unless he or she becomes like a little child.  On another occasion, Jesus is approached by a rich young man who wants to know how to be part of God’s reign.  Jesus eyes him steadily and says “sell all you have and give it to the poor.”  Jesus knows the priority that holds this man back; Jesus senses what rules the man’s heart.  Jesus invites him to open to changing this priority of riches and embracing the possibility of abundant life in the present. The man sighs and walks away.  Excluded not from some future place in heaven, mind you, but choosing self-exclusion from fully participating in abundant life now.\\n\\t\\tWe hear the words of the Apostle Paul, where he widens the circle of just who is included in the notion of “the people of God.”  His own inner transformation, as he encountered the forgiving spirit of the living Christ, compelled him to expand the circle of traditional Judaism of his day.  He set aside former understandings of his own Scriptures to boldly include those outsides the circle:  Jews and Gentiles, slave and free, male and female, he writes – all are considered “as one” in Christ Jesus.   We too have set aside former assumptions based on Scripture about people of color and the LGBT community, all for the greater good of serving this Gospel of inclusion.  \\n\\tHere is the huge challenge for a congregation such as ours, in my view:  Our high-minded intent to be inclusive is going to become increasingly challenging as our surrounding culture continues to diversify.  Coming to worship and participating in the programs of this place will entail getting to know and understand people who are increasingly different from us.   You will try to do this within a wider culture that is increasingly fearful about those who are different than us, and tells us we need to protect ourselves from those who would destroy our lifestyle and values.   But I believe this focus on inclusivity will become the source of your renewed vitality and faithfulness as a faith community.  Paradoxically, the Gospel message claims that we will be able to truly be inclusive in the way of Jesus, only by excluding ideas and behaviors that limit inclusivity!  No one can change your inner attitudes, but this church can no longer tolerate anti-gay comments.  If you hear anti-gay comments around here, say something!  No one can force anyone else’s beliefs, but we can hold ourselves accountable to Kingdom behavior of welcome and respect.  You can hold yourselves accountable to ways of being with one another that lovingly challenge prejudices and encourage our inner transformation into the mind of Christ.  We can hold ourselves accountable to acting in ways that persistently push this congregation to take public stands against the dehumanization of certain people.   \\n\\n\\t\\tI close with these words of the United Church of Christ Biblical scholar, Walter Bruggemann, who has written this about inclusivity:   \\n\\t\\t“A bent toward inclusion runs great risks, but they are \\trisks faithful to the gospel. In the long run such risks \\tserve the kingdom. In the short run, they are the requirements of fidelity among us.” \\n\\t\\tMay we be faithful to God and to one another in this on-going work of inclusivity.  Amen. \\n\\n\\nNotes: Walter Bruggemann, from an article written in response to the UCC “God is Still Speaking – Ejector Ad.” (http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/unitedchurchofchrist/legacy_url/19865/the-ejector-brueggemann.pdf?1418446509)',\n",
       " '\\tToday’s texts could be subtitled:  How to be a weak leader!  Both the passage from Paul’s letter and this story of Jesus in his hometown are stories of challenge and rejection.  The apostle Paul’s authority is being challenged by some other “apostle pretenders” in the area.  Jesus can’t seem to make much head-way in his own hometown and basically moves on unable to do anything but a few minor healings.  There is curious thread running through both these accounts:  The odd suggestion that there is strength in our vulnerability, even power in our weakness.  This doesn’t seem to make sense, and it certainly is not how much of our contemporary world operates.  And goodness gracious, how do you run your life or the work of the church with vulnerability and weakness?   \\t\\n\\t\\n\\tIn wondering about this, I’ll share with you about how your Church Council and I met a week ago Saturday for a time of extended planning.  We were to review input from the member surveys that many of you completed this spring.  Establish some overall goals for the next 6 months of transition, that might help guide specific decisions about what to do with resources at hand. There have been lots of ideas floating around about what should be done the grassy courtyard of this property:  bell tower, playground, gardens.  The Council realized we were lacking some clear priorities that would guide us in weighing such decisions as a congregation.   And they did come up with three goals, which I’ll describe in upcoming sermons and the next newsletter.  But they way they got there is what was most important.\\n\\t\\n\\tGoal setting, short-term, long-term planning – these are familiar terms an organizational setting.  But in the faith community, in the church, this kind of pondering and planning looks a bit different.  In fact it can seem alittle fuzzy, almost non-rational, and a bit more personal, than business or nonprofit planning.   Yes, we try to weigh the facts, look at the resources, be realistic.  But, in all interactions and decisions within the church, we are trying to discern, to figure out where God is leading us.  Discussion helps, but this is also an intuitive type process:  we also need silence, reflection, prayer, and a sense of spaciousness. \\n\\t\\n\\tThis is where regular soaking in scripture comes in, because we can’t read too much of the Bible without realizing again that God has an individual relationship with us, and that our lives are probably filled with too much “go it alone, rugged individualism.”  The Bible tells us how God is extremely interested in communicating with us and working with us to heal our world and our individual lives. \\n\\tBack to our Council retreat.   I invited the group to begin their time together just like I have begun countless youth group and confirmation classes through the years:  By each sharing a “high” and  “low” from our last week.  A bit reluctantly at first, around the circle we went, each one sharing a bit.  But soon there was laughter, there were also sighs and a few sympathetic groans.  One Council member commented later that it is easy to share a “high” – a time when things are going well for us, a success, a son’s accomplishment or the birth of a granddaughter.  But it is in sharing our “lows,” that strangely enough, a sense of connection begins to build.  A time when something went wrong, or we made a mistake, or maybe even appeared weak.  Sharing “lows” can make us feel more open and also vulnerable.  Where is God in this messy situation, we ask ourselves?  And yet, as others listen to us with full attention and compassion, burdens are shared without judgment.  Slowly deeper trust can build on a team of people that need to work together by listening to God together.   We then delved into the last chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, where the Risen Jesus is sending out his disciples:  Go and make disciples of all peoples, baptize them, teaching them to obey my commandments, and remember I am with you always.   This is the charge of the church.   Finally, we took the bold step of praying for the person on our right.  In simple everyday language, people gave thanks for “highs” expressed and asked God’s help for vulnerabilities, losses, even weaknesses that had been shared.   \\n\\t\\n\\tWhen we got to reviewing the Council’s job description in the By-Laws, there was a palpably deeper spiritual connection, between our spirits and God’s spirit, in the room:  The group found it somewhat surprising to be reminded that the “It is the duty of the Council to plan for and oversee the spiritual growth of the Congregation.”  Of course it goes on to describe transacting the business of the congregation, budgeting, distributing charity of the congregation.  But it starts with something broader and less easy to calculate and define.  “The spiritual growth of the congregation.”  Looking at this afresh was a bit startling for all involved.  It’s easy and natural to become focused on buildings and even programs in a church.  But the more we talked about this, the clearer it became that the Council leaders job was to guide us in growing spiritually, as followers of this Jesus.  We wondered together:  What would it be like if we were better at this church at “talking our walk?”  Yes, it is so important to “Walk your talk,” to let our actions of loving-kindness speak louder than our words.  We realized we need to be able to talk with each other and our young people about our lives, our faith experience, our beliefs and doubts.  What would it look like to use every opportunity we gather together, whatever committee or Board or project, to grow spiritually together?  How could the Council help this happen?  Without such clarity of its role, it is natural for Church Councils slip back into following the trend of many church leaders:  trying to keep the most number of people happy, most of the time.\\n\\t\\n\\tToday’s gospel text focuses on Jesus’ inability to please people in his hometown.  Jesus seems to get in the way of their “pursuit of happiness.” Jesus arrives in his home community and starts to teach in the synagogue; immediately his neighbors react with astonishment, offence and disbelief “Where did this man get all this?  What is this wisdom that has been given to him?” they jeeringly question.  It’s not his actions of healing that bother them, but his teaching; something about the power and authority of Jesus’ word that really grates on people. Which has left me asking: Should following the teachings of Jesus make us happy?  \\n\\t\\n\\tOur founding church members in the By-Laws invite us to ask a different kind of question:  What choices, what practices, will help us be more faithful to God?  To God’s call to radical hospitality, to welcoming the stranger, the sojourner, in our midst?  Where might we each be challenged, within the church, to give up some of our personal happiness, comfort zones, for the greater purpose of being faithful? \\n\\t\\n\\tJesus seemed remarkably disinterested in what made people happy.  He didn’t seem to be particularly interested in our personal fulfillment either.  He would say strange things like “those who would keep their life must loose it.”  The apostle Paul really wrestled with how miserable he was at times; rarely does he seem like a happy, blessed or fortunate guy in his letters to the young churches. But again and again he came around to exclaiming joyfully how the spirit of the living Christ was working in him.  This living presence allowed the self-focused parts of him to die-off, transforming him into Christ’s likeness.  Ironically, where Paul experienced his own weakness, there he knew God’s power and felt strong.   \\n\\t\\n\\tIt is quite amazing how some simple sharing of “highs” and “lows” or whatever way we begin talking with each other about what is real in our lives, done on a repeated basis, can bring us closer to one another and to God.  Try it at home with family, with friends this week. It can become a way to “talk” about our “walk” with Jesus together.  It enables us discern God’s presence in the difficult times, and help us see God’s power in our own limitations and even failures.   Thanks be to God; Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t ',\n",
       " \"\\tIt is both an honor and delight to finally join with you in worship this Sunday morning!  I bring you greetings from Emmaus United Church of Christ in northern Virginia, where until last Sunday I was serving as Interim Minister. Know that the Emmaus members there are holding both you and me in their prayers, as we begin our ministry together.  \\n\\n\\tToday’s scripture passage from the New Testament is a challenging one in normal circumstances…such as when a pastor and a congregation have been together for a while, developed some trust and are eager to push deeper into what it means to follow Jesus.   If that were our current situation, we might welcome such instruction from the apostle Paul.  “Be of the same mind and heart!”  In this letter Paul is reaching out to a new, struggling congregation he started in Philippi (present day Greece).  Apparently, church conflict is nothing new; this young church’s disagreements have taken their toll on communal unity.  Paul is pretty blunt with them: “look here, if you want to have any consolation from love, any sense of encouragement from the living spirit of Christ, if you want to share in the Spirit with compassion and sympathy as a community….” (I can just hear the Philippians muttering to each other….”yes, yes, get to the point Paul”).   “If you want this,” Paul continues, “you have to do the following:  you’ve got to be of the same mind and the same heart.”   But wait a minute: in what church is that going to happen?  And if this idea wasn’t problematic enough for them– being a first century congregation always of the same mind and heart -  how do we hear this in the 21st century.  We might well ask: where’s the freedom of individual interpretation in that call for sameness?  Where’s our welcome of different beliefs and perspectives that we value in the United Church of Christ?  \\n\\n\\tBut Paul continues with an even more unsettling proposition:  You all need the mind that was in Christ Jesus and it goes like this….here is his mindset, his basic attitude:  ”Christ humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross.”  But is this an invitation to all fall on our swords?  And less dramatically, can’t humility sometimes cover for low self-esteem?  Really….who dares to act humbly in our contemporary world that demands constant competiveness, efficiency and success?!  This is a tall order, and a difficult message to proclaim to people I hardly know yet! \\n\\n\\tIt has been many months since that spring evening in May when I interviewed with your interim pastor search team.  Since that time your leadership has negotiated the resignations and you have said goodbye to both your called Senior Pastor Rich and Associate Pastor Rich.  You have welcomed and worked for with your Summer Pastor Howard.  And now, you are meeting me, Interim Pastor Anne.  The new, called Pastor who will lead you into the future is nowhere in sight.  That is a lot of change and uncertainty.  I imagine this transition has stirred up a complex mix of sadness, relief, anger, disappointment, hopefulness for many of you.  If you are a newcomer, this may all seem a bit confusing….perhaps even off-putting.   Is there anything in Paul’s message that might be a clue as to how we move forward together?\\n\\n\\tEach time I begin a period of Intentional interim ministry with a new congregation, my “hello” is mixed with a “goodbye.”  Which is sure a strange way to start a new job!  But my employment agreement with your Executive Board, which invites me to serve as your Interim Pastor, specifically states that I will not be a candidate for the eventual called Pastor position at Falcon Heights Church.  Some of you are familiar with these terms from your previous interim times.  While there may seem to be an awkwardness to all this limit-setting, intentional interim periods help congregations take a deep breath and do the creative, exploratory work that is only possible in between settled or called ministers.  And, we are not “wooing” each other here.  This should free us up a bit with each other.  As I shared with your choir on Wednesday evening, over our time together I may need to ask some hard questions about your life together that may unsettle or make some of you mad.  And I will need you to be real with me.  Speak with me directly, if you have a problem with what I am doing.  We will be trying to discern together what God is calling this congregation to next.  Or, in a phrase the apostle Paul would use:  what is God’s “good pleasure” for this church?  What is God’s hope, God’s will for Falcon Heights Church?  \\n\\n\\tI have found that it is pretty darn impossible to discover God’s “good pleasure” for a congregation when that church doesn’t have an honest, respectful and mutually accountable relationship with its Pastor.  And, with one another.  An intentional interim period between called Pastors is a unique time to learn how to do this more fully and creatively.  Compassion and accountability.  You can practice on me the kind of relationship you hope for with a new called Pastor.  This whole interim process will involve careful self-reflection and open discussion among you.  What have been the blessings and challenges, accomplishments and the problems, of your years together as Christian community?    In this exploration process, every voice needs to be heard. Just like in a healthy family, everyone should get their say, but not everyone will get their way all of the time!   This work has to happen before a new pastoral search committee is formed.  It will take, in Paul’s words, looking to the interests of others, beyond our own.  Having a mind of openness and humility that we see in the life and ministry of Jesus.  \\n\\n\\tA word of caution:  this is serious business, but can easily be dismissed as a call for niceness, ignoring hurts and suppressing resentments.  Fluffy Christian love stuff.  Given the recent level of tension among you, one might well wonder how you will recover and thrive again as a congregation.  Research done with conflicted congregations is not encouraging on this front.  Apparently, only 10% of congregations recover – spiritually, numerically, financially - when their level of conflict has reached that of separate, hostile factions and stays that way for two or more years.  Often in congregations such as these, some people stay and to fight to get their way, some people stay but remain quietly on the sidelines, and some people simply say “enough” and leave the church.  Ouch.  That’s the bad news: 90% of these congregations end up repeating the same destructive patterns, over and over, and never really regain their vitality and strength as a faith community.  Things may quiet down.  Visible conflict may seem to disappear, people choose to not talk about it anymore. But a congregation can be left feeling traumatized, and less connected with one another.  Depressed, even lifeless….walking on eggshells…fearful of the next inevitable disagreement and blow-up.  The church stays stuck in trying to meet its members' preferences and keep folks happy.  It doesn’t leave much energy to focus on fulfilling God’s purpose, God’s “good pleasure” for this time and place.  For creatively thinking about how to use your greatest gifts and strengths to meet the greatest needs in the community beyond your doors.\\n  \\t \\n\\tIn a curious bit of serendipity, our Minnesota Conference of the United Church of Christ offered a training this last week on dealing with conflict in congregations.  I attended, along with your Financial Secretary Jan Blomberg and your new Assistant Treasurer, Sue Liillehei.  Perhaps the most important reminder to the three of us was this call to learn from our past as congregations:  To recover from conflict, any congregation needs to carefully explore what has happened. The goal is not to wallow in it, blame others.  The intent is not to re-traumatize ourselves or re-form different opinion camps.  “Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others,” Paul writes.  Sometimes when lines have been drawn and sides taken, a complex situation gets boiled down to over-simplified generalizations.  There seems to be only one problem with one solution.  Paul wisely notes that we loose track of each other’s interests and each other’s perspectives.  We lose our sense of curiosity about the other person. We are now longer aware of their concerns, their hopes and their fears. Consequently, we lose our empathy for each other as fellow members of the body of Christ.  \\n\\tOur job in this interim period will be to “get up in the balcony,” and take a wider view.  We will need to ask some hard questions and see how your church culture, your church system, over the years has allowed for all of this.  The good news:  it is possible to recover well.  I have come to trust in this kind of healing process.  I am hopeful for you as a congregation.  As Paul describes, “it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for God’s good pleasure.”  Thankfully, we don’t do this work under our own steam.  \\n\\t In this interim time, I ask that you join us in worship as often as you can; worship is the heart of our life together.  It will keep us focused on the spirit of the Living Christ in our midst, and give us inspiration and nourishment for the interim work ahead.  I urge you to continue, or even start again, to support the church financially.  Not just to meet a budget but in thanksgiving for the blessings in your lives.  Give in hope of the re-vitalization you long for here.  I ask you to be patient with the interim process and honest with me about how you experience my leadership.  Know that I am here with you, with gratitude and hopefulness for all that we will experience in our interim work together.   For this I give thanks to God!  Amen.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Both of today’s scripture readings include dramatic interaction between humans, the forces of evil and God.  The Genesis story offers what I understand to be a mythological tale about the first humans, Adam and Eve, complete with talking animals and a mystical garden.  The story is well worth further discussion among us, but for starters:  This ancient Jewish creation story from 10th century BCE is not a scientific description of the how humans appeared on earth, nor a replacement for scientific theories of human evolution.  Nor was the story intended as a condemnation of women (that comes later in church history, as the pervasive patriarchal society begins to corrupt Jesus’ teachings – think “justicification for persecuting witches – 15th century CE).  Also, in the original Hebrew, the serpent is not the devil; personification of evil comes much later, with influences from Persian religion.  Probably most importantly, it is not about original sin either, in my view – an original flawed nature we all inherit because of A and E’s disobedience.  This interpretation arose in around the 3rd-4th century of Christianity, and led to some problematic understandings about the purpose of Jesus’ death.   Further discussion among us needed!\\nIn the Genesis story, Adam and Eve are confronted with the temptation to be more than human and to embrace God-like powers of certain knowledge and immortality.  What’s wrong with knowing good from evil, one might ask?  Perhaps their mistake was claiming a power to divide the world into black and white, into good and bad.  This dualistic way of thinking that has caused no end of problems for humandkind, as we often claim good in us and project all bad/evil outside of us.  \\nSo what to make of this story – that has wrecked such havoc in it’s misinterpretations??!!  It is a foundational mythological tale that attempts to explain our present condition of human life, all its messiness and brokenness.  A life where we often pretend we are God-like as we overreach our limits and then we blame others.  We forget we are created in God’s image: we become ashamed, we hide from God and become estranged from each other.  Good story to ponder in Lent.  \\nThe Matthew narrative is a description of Jesus being tempted in much the same way.  We have no idea if this was a literal encounter with some personalized face of evil, or an equally harrowing vocational struggle within Jesus’ own psyche.    Following his baptism by John the Baptism, he heads to the wilderness on what could be described as a vision quest.  What is this urgency within me?  This sense of God calling me to do…what?  Engaging the time-honored spiritual practice of fasting, honing his spiritual attentiveness, he confronts – what – his shadow side?  Hallucinations?  Matthew calls it “the devil” – which means basically “adversary” in this context.  Forget the red guy with horns and a pitchfork, or visions of Dante’s “Inferno.”  Think poetic language to describe great truth!  Jesus is invited, beguiled, to take on impressive powers that are admired and celebrated in the human kingdoms of the world.  These promised powers will make him great in humans eyes, maybe even spread his message further!   But yielding to these temptations will ultimately run contrary to his purpose.  He is to be the one who preaches the “alternative community,” a kingdom marked by Self-sacrifice, vulnerability, humility.    \\n\\tCan you hear the snear in the adversary’s voice: “If you are the Son of God,” it taunts, “how about this?”  First century listeners to this story would not necessarily associate the title “Son of God” with meaning Jesus was divine.  “Son of God” was a honorary title well known in Judaism:  Kings in the Davidic line during Israel’s golden age were called “Sons of God” and the people of Israel are sometimes themselves called “Sons of God.”  But maybe most importantly, in the first century Greco-Roman world, human emperors were using this title.  “Son of God” was an honorary title for the Caesars, who lived extravagant lifestyles, had the power of a huge army behind them and ruled with an iron fist.  “If you are the Son of God,” the adversary says, “if you are going to be high and mighty like the Caesars….” mocks the adversary. “What kind of Son of God are you, really?”  \\n\\tThe tests that follow are pretty tempting, not so much because Jesus is hungry and tired.  They are tempting because they challenge Jesus to get really clear about what he is called to do and not do in his ministry.  And they are confusingly tempting because they contain partial truths:  “Come on Jesus, I know you are going to be concerned about the needy and the hungry!  Let’s get started here, by turning these stones into bread.  Hey Jesus, God’s reign of justice and peace is a real challenge to earthly corrupt powers.  Don’t you want to have dominion over the kingdoms of the earth so you can get this Kingdom of God thing started in the right way?!”   Finally, the adversary quotes promises from the Hebrew Psalms:  “God’s protection is promised to the righteous who call on God’s name!”  In an ironic twist, the adversary suggests Jesus try this out in the center of Israel’s holy city in the sacred Temple.   “So Jesus, you certainly are righteous; how about you just fling yourself off this Temple balcony?  Go ahead, lean into the promises of the ever gracious and saving God!”   \\nIt’s one thing to say no to something that we know is really wrong.  But what about the places in our lives that seem less clear?   The day-to-day ethical choices that are awash with partial truths, with ambiguity; a simple statement that borders on a tiny lie, a misrepresentation about ourselves or someone else, Saying we think or feel something when we really don’t.  Leaving parts out of a certain story when we talk with our suspicious parent or spouse.    These are the messy places in our lives where God calls us to make the choices that reflect who we really are.  Created in God’s image, beloved, forgiven children of God.\\nOn this first Sunday in Lent, we might well wonder to ourselves:  what would it mean for me to more fully live into God’s will for me, as God’s beloved son or daughter?   What full truth about ourselves, our church, are we each being asked to face this day?  Such are the questions of the Lenten season.  Thanks be to God. Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tOnce in royal David’s city stood a lowly cattle shed,\\n\\tWhere a mother laid her baby in a manger for a bed.\\n\\tMary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ her little child.\\nSo here is the setting for Jesus’ arrival, which we considered two nights ago in our Christmas Eve services here.  Bethlehem, by tradition the birthplace of Israel’s great King David, from the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel, ruling over Juday from 1010-970 BCE.  Jewish tradition held that the Messiah, the one who would be sent by God to bring the mercy and justice of God’s judgment to the world, would also be born in Bethlehem.  Both the Gospel writers Luke and Matthew claim that Jesus is a direct descendant of King David, down through Jesus’ earthly father, Joseph.   Join me in the second verse:\\n\\tJesus came to earth from heaven, who is God and Head of all.\\n\\tSheltered in a rustic stable, cradled in a common stall;\\n\\tWith the poor and meek and lowly lived on earth our Savior holy.\\nNow Cecil Humphrey Alexander begins to make some rather audacious claims about this baby:  he started in a place called heaven, and is both a person and  “God and Head of all.”   In the balance between divine and human, this is pretty high Christology when it comes to speaking of the meaning of the Incarnation….God “incarnate,” embodied, among us.  The Holy one, in some way a Savior among us, here in the midst of a barn.   Destined for a ministry among the marginalized, “the poor and meek and lowly.”  But we are getting ahead of ourselves!\\n\\tTwo nights ago Jesus was a newborn infant.  In today’s text from the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is 12 years old and hanging out with Torah scholars in the Jerusalem Temple.   How did we get from the little baby, meek and mild in the manger, to a precocious, probably pubescent young teen who strikes out on his on and is rather rude to his parents?   Before exploring what Jesus was up to, talking with the scholars of his day, we might do well to re-orient ourselves.  For the rest of our contemporary culture, the stretch of days right after Christmas usually brings a wash of relief, and we too might be feeling some of this as well.   House-guests head for home, left-overs disappear and diets slowly return to normal, decorations will begin to be packed-away.  The frenzy of festivity can be exhausting. And for some among us, Christmas is an unusually trying, lonely or sad time.  The week after Christmas brings a welcome blank slate where one doesn’t have to fake the holiday cheer.   It also brings us to a curious pausing point in the liturgical calendar of the Christian Church: right in between the Feast of the Nativity, God coming to us in Jesus’ birth, and the Feast of Epiphany, the manifestation of this rather bewildering reality to all the world.  \\n\\tThe 12 Days of Christmas, this period between Christmas Day and the Feast of Epiphany, give us some time to ponder these things.  This morning, we hear the only story we have about Jesus as a boy.   I find helpful to remember that hero stories in ancient literature often featured tales of unusual births and stories of miraculous childhood feats.   We don’t know the origins of this story; it may well have been passed down by Jesus relatives.  No other Gospel writer mentions it, nor do any of the Apostle Paul’s letters.  It’s actually pretty down-to-earth tale, after the last few weeks of angels appearing, an older woman and a younger, virginal women becoming pregnant, more angels singing to shepherds in the middle of the night.  Today’s story follows Jesus, his parents, relatives and friends up into the vast city Jerusalem.  Traveling as a large group, it would be usual for young people of Jesus’ age to They are on a pilgrimage, traveling to the huge Temple to celebrate one of three important Feast days, The Passover.  Celebrated each spring, Passover commemorated God’s mercy in “passing over” the homes of Jewish slaves in Egypt, as the final plague of death of firstborn Egyptian boys sweeps over Pharaoh’s reign.  In grief and exasperation, the oppressive Pharoah releases the Jewish people who flee into the wilderness and their journey towards freedom.  Luke is letting us know that Jesus grows up in an observant Jewish household, steeped in the story and traditions of 1st century Judaism. After the 8 day festival commemorating this miraculous event in their religious history, the family sets out for home, not noticing that Jesus is not among the crowd of travelers.\\n\\tLet’s sing together the third verse of “Once in Royal David’s City” and see how it might contrast with Luke’s version:\\n\\tAnd through all this wondrous childhood Jesus honored and obeyed.\\n\\tLoved and watched the tender mother whose strong arms a cradle made.\\n\\tSo, like Jesus, we should be serving God obediently.\\nHmmmm….this story is an peculiar model for honoring and obeying your parents!  Joseph and Mary are both astonished and understandably irritated when they find him in the Temple.  Whatever was going on in Jesus’ brain at the time, it is clear that an emerging sense of identity and purpose is starting to form within him.   Perhaps this all might have seemed a bit radical to a women raised in Victorian era British Isles, even in rebellious Ireland!  Let’s sing the final two verses:\\n\\tJesus is our childhood’s pattern, daily like us lived and grew,\\n\\tJesus, little, weak and helpless, tears and smiles and comfort knew.\\n\\tJesus felt the pain of sadness and the joyous lift of gladness.\\n\\n\\tWe at last shall meet our Savior, fount of God’s redeeming grace,\\n\\tFor the Child so dear and gentle reigns within a glorious place;\\n\\tLeading all God’s children on to the heaven where saints have gone.\\n\\nThere is something quite tender about that phrase, “Jesus is our childhood’s pattern, daily like us lived and grew.”  I find it encouraging to think of Jesus growing beyond his littleness, weak and helplessness, to a young boy who strides out confidently on his own.  Stimulated by his growing intellect, his sense of being in his own body in his own capacities for new choices.  Let that be a pattern for each of us.   He will grow beyond dearness and gentleness, eventually confronting and challenge powers of hypocrisy and corruption, selfishness and deceit, marginalization and oppression.  Perhaps this is the “pattern” God seeks for each of us, and that Luke is signaling in this unusual story.  How do we each come to know and claim our own identity, our own sense of mission as one of God’s own?  No one else can do what we are each called, individually, to do with our one and precious life.   \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThe challenge in the weeks after Easter might be put this way:  “So, what now?”  Or put a little more crassly:  “Jesus is resurrected?  So what?  What difference does this make?” We remember that the disciples of Jesus had been hiding away in fear of the Roman authorities.  They were also terribly ashamed of betraying Jesus, and not to eager to re-encounter what they assumed would be an angry and unforgiving Lord.    But in encounter and encounter with the Risen Jesus, they have experienced a sense of forgiveness and a deep empowerment.  These men and women are now out all over the place spreading the word about God’s transforming presence and call to new life.  And over a period of years, of decades really, they collect stories about Jesus’ ministry and teaching that keep them focused on His living presence among them.  Today’s story from the Gospel of John is one of these remembered teachings.  The setting:  the last supper Jesus shared with his friends before his death. \\n\\tJesus is talking about their life together in community.  What strikes me first is Jesus’ use of the word “abide:”  “Abide in me, as I abide in you,” he says to the followers.  Now this is a curious thing to say if you know you are leaving.  Abide here means less “stay put” and more “to be at home in.”  Like a grape branch is rooted to the vine, we are to draw our sustainance up through the knarly roots sunk deep into the soul of our spiritual lives.  Jesus presenting himself as the main trunk.  Minerals, water, all the things we need to grow and flourish traveling through him out to our the branches of our lives.  We start to bear fruit, deeds of courage and compassion in our lives.  But only if we are to stay rooted in, abiding, in the Risen Jesus. \\n\\t\\n\\tJesus’ Jewish listeners and later the readers of John’s Gospel would have been familiar with the metaphor of the entwining grapevine; it was a common word picture used throughout Hebrew scriptures to describe Israel, the people of God.  In these final words to his followers at the Last Supper, Jesus uses the the wider vineyard metaphor to describe the organic unity of loving actions between God, Jesus and the community of faith.  God’s loving actions, like an attentive gardener, shape us.  \\n\\tJesus compared us to grape branches and grapes.  A hearty, bountiful image?  Actually, Jesus’ comparison may say more about how fragile you and I really are.  Earlier this year, a report came out from the US Department of Agriculture about the 2011 California grape harvest.  Down 7%, with a production decrease of 17% in some places like Sonoma Valley.  The percentage may not sound like much but that dip entails from 250,000-half a million tons of grapes.  What had caused the decline?  Things overwhich the humans, the growers, had no control.  Like unexpected freezes in early spring, followed but heavy rains knocking off the early vineflower blooms.  Then a cool summer, and then more heavy rain in the Fall and fields of grapes were rotting before they could be picked. \\n\\tI’m sure Jesus was aware that many of us seem to thrive in our faith under “good conditions.”  We talk of how God is blessing us with loving family and bountiful resources; these are the times it feels natural to thank God, to feel close to God.   The challenge for most of us is when these external conditions change.  When the “weather” of our lives dramatically shifts, storms come and we experience failure or illness or sudden tragedy.   Is it possible to keep bearing good fruit under such conditions?\\n\\tJesus may have been some kind of first century wine expert, because apparently, bad growing conditions do not always inhibit grape production. Out in California last year there were some heartier varieties of grapes that did better than they have ever done in 2011!  It all depended on the resiliency and quality of the vine the branches were attached to, whether they were going to survive the changing weather and bear more fruit than expected.   The weather of our lives is going to come and go, mild and rough.  What are we attached to?  Where do we draw meaning and sustainence as a person?  As a family?  As a church?   The appearance of our exteriors, our face and bodies, our homes, the things we accumulate, even our church building, all of which can change in the flash of disaster?   Notice this week what you are attached to.  Where are you drawing your energy and sustanence.   \\n\\tJesus described God’s role in our lives as like the vinegrower.  One thing vinegrowers do a lot of is prune the vines. The years I lived in California it never ceased to amaze me to watch how severly the vineyard growers would prune those grapevines.  Right back to one sturdy central branch; I couldn’t imagine how it was still alive; how would it ever bear fruit again?  I have heard many people identify an act of trauma, injustice, abandonment or abuse with God’s pruning.  As though the experienced pruning was a punishment.  But I believe the pruning and tending of us, the vine, is God simply clearing way the debris after the storms rip through our lives.   God wants to prune away the old ideas and ways of explaining things that just don’t work for us anymore.  \\n\\tI first came to understand how I needed to submit to this kind of pruning as a young mother.  My perfectionist self struggled with the mistakes that are part of the territory of parenting.  Balancing mothering and ministry in a public position, I often sensed God pruning away my false pride and assumptions.  Over and over calling me to abide in God’s grace.  To God’s acceptance of me.  Jesus’ words would both challenge and encourage:  “abide in me, abide in my love…those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.”  The challenge was to envision my leafy tendrils drawing their sustenance from Jesus, in silence, in prayer, in scripture study, in reflective walks along a lonely beach.  Re-imagining how I needed to cling to the central branch which is grounded in God the Creator.  Not just to hang-out in a cozy, secure way, but so I could “bear fruits” of a new life.  Learning that I was now a mother who experienced mistakes and regrets in her mothering, I also came to experience my connection a long line of Jesus’ forgiven followers.  \\n\\tWe are all part of the lushly intertwined branches; not free-standing plants on our own.  And we are linked not to just a memory of Jesus’ teaching but to the ongoing presence of the Risen Lord.  We are linked organically to this Risen Jesus who is both rooted branch and the presence at our Communion Table.  I’m glad to think of us as such plants.  Fruitful plants, I hope.  Leafy branches abiding in Jesus.  Drawing our sustenance from God’s great mystery and redemptive power.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThrough the Sundays in October, we have been hearing different stories about Jesus from the Gospel of Mark.  In each story, we have learned a bit more about how he understood the in-breaking of God’s Kingdom, God’s reign among us.  Jesus welcomed a bunch of children and said we are to receive the Reign of God as we might openly receive a vulnerable child.  Jesus was questioned by a rich man concerning abundant life, and replied that we enter into it at great cost; our attachments to things, prestige and security may be impediments to fully participating in a full life in God’s reign of compassion and justice.  In a conversation with his closest followers, Jesus described that we may endure some suffering as followers of on his Way; clamoring after power and position will impede us.  In today’s healing story we hear of someone visually blind who nevertheless “sees” Jesus and what he is doing.  In all of these stories, we have been trying to listen within ourselves for hints, glimpses, imaginings of where God is calling this church to next.  In what ways are we to welcome and enact God’s Reign here in this place, so we might be transformed and we might be bigger part of healing our hurting world?  What is the guiding vision for this congregation?  Not easy questions.  Many of you have shared your ideas on sticky notes; you are invited to do so again today.\\nOur Discovery Team, which is helping me guide you through this interim period between called pastors, has been reading through all your colored sticky-notes of different visions of where God might be calling this congregation.  When we met a few nights ago, we were a bit confounded by the diversity of comments.  Some notes referred to preserving beloved traditions.  Others urged various changes and new growth.  One of the Discovery Team members finally suggested: One way to get at any organization’s guiding vision or purpose, is to try and imagine what would be missing if the organization disappeared.  We realized that, prayerfully done and seeking God’s input, this could work for a church.  What would be missing in this community, in your lives, if this part of the church/the Body of Christ here simply no longer existed?  How might you answer?  With that question in mind, the DT shared what they personally would miss, and what they thought the community would miss. We re-visited all the sticky notes so far and found some similar themes emerging.  We could then see that the DT and your responses hovered around a certain kind of inclusion and theological openness experienced; one that seems to encourage both personal change and wider outreach and service to others.  Nancy Duffrin from the Team will speak more about this at our congregational meeting after worship.\\nFor the moment, let’s return to the red ribbons that were just now draped around our shoulders.  I told the children that these ribbons are symbols of us each being called by God, through the spirit of the Living Jesus Christ in our midst.  We are called to figure out what are the gifts for ministry that we each have that we can share through this congregation.   And what might this mean for us individually, and for you all together as a church?  As we interact with the Biblical text, we may find some clues in this story about Jesus healing a blind man.  And there may be some clues in the visions of the Protestant Reformers, whose brave work we celebrate today on Reformation Sunday.  \\n\\tOur text from the Gospel of Mark draws us deeper into this vision metaphor.  At first glance, it’s about literally not being able to see with your eyes.  Looking deeper, it may also about spiritual perception.   What do we see right now; what can we not see yet; what are we reluctant to really see in our church, our families, the world around us?  As this story begins, Jesus and his disciples are on the way to Jerusalem, passing through the town of Jericho. Suddenly, a man sitting by the side of the road calls out to Jesus.   Bartimeaus is described to be blind and a beggar.  Bottom of the pile economically, with no means taking care of himself other than asking for hand-outs.  His physical deformity of blindness would be considered by some in his time as a sign of God’s displeasure and the his own sinfulness.  \\n\\tWhat future does Bartimaeus “see” for himself, we might wonder.  Where does he get the gumption to speak out, is what I want to know.  “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” he shouts loudly.  People in Jesus’ group, and those who have gathered along the road, sternly rebuke the man.  “Pipe down already, you are making a scene.”  “Son of David,” bellows the man, “have mercy on me!”  “Son of David” is a Messianic title in Judaism; Bartimaeus is linking Jesus to a long lineage, going back to Israel’s most famous King during the height of its prestige and power of the united monarchy in the 900’s before Christ.   This man without economic means, status or sight, “sees” something in Jesus that even his disciples have been missing: this is the Messiah, this is the one ushering in God’s reign of justice, compassion and mercy.  \\nCould our own individual spiritual “sight” help us understand what God is calling us to next.?  Is our “sight” damaged or impeded, or simply underdeveloped?  The text would suggest that God wants our spiritual sight to be healed.  What a challenge:  to perceive and really hold on to God’s promises, to let these be a bedrock in our lives, and to move forward at the same time…in spite of evidence to the contrary!  In spite of difficult things that have happened in our lives, and in the life of this church.  The novelist and theologian, Frederick Buechner describes this visualizing of God’s presence and promises in his book, Secrets in the Dark.  \\xa0\"By faith,” Buechner writes, “we understand, if we are to understand it at all, that the madness and lostness we see all around us and within us are not the last truth about the world but only the next to the last truth.”  Buechner goes on to describe faith in an interesting way, that helps me understand what Jesus means when he says “your faith has made you well.”\\n“Faith,” continues Buechner, “is the eye of the heart, and by faith we see deep down beneath the face of things – by faith we struggle against all odds to be able to see – that the world is God\\'s creation even so.”  Even though tragedy has happened.  Even though this church has been torn by conflict.\\xa0 Buechner concludes: “It is (God) who made us and not we ourselves, made us out of God’s peace to live in peace, out of God’s light to dwell in light, out of God’s love to be above all things loved and loving.\\xa0That is the last truth about the world.\"  Faith, trust in God: the eye of the heart, sees this final truth.  Notice how after Jesus responds to the man, the disciples tell Bartimaeus: “take heart; get up, he is calling.”  \\nJesus’ praises the man’s faith as being trust, not correct doctrine.  It is a willingness coming out of a deep perception of who Jesus is – “your trusting, this deeper seeing, has made you well, whole, renewed,” Jesus says to the Bartimaeus.  The eyes of Bartimaeus’ heart saw and recognized Jesus as the one ushering in God’s kingdom of justice and mercy.  The eyes of his heart knew that the “madness and lostness” all around him were not the last truth about the world.\\xa0\\nWe are made “out of God’s light to dwell in light,” wrote Buechener.   Perhaps we are each called to be a light filled vision to those around us.  We are to help each envision a future where God is working in all things for good.   We don’t know what this coming year will bring here or in our own lives, or what your time with your future pastor will be like.   But we do know that our fears can bring on a certain spiritual blindness.  “What do you want from me,” Jesus asks blind Bartimeus.  “Teacher, let me see again,” he says.  I too need to ask the spirit of the Risen Jesus over and over, “let me see again.”  What do you need Jesus to do for you so you can live more fully into your call?\\nFinally, it was those Protestant Reformers, from whom we in the United Church of Christ are spiritually descended, who called people to see the possibilities of God’s re-vitalizing movement among them.  To search the scriptures in their own native language and to hear Jesus calling them. In the midst of institutional corruption and individual disempowerment, the reformers claimed that the Risen Jesus continued to call them to reform and keep reforming the church.  And so too, we each are called. To move together into God’s uncertain but good future.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tBut then I realized that, while catchy, this little ditty didn’t do justice to where we actually are today in the Biblical narrative today.  Speaking still in first century language, I will re-order the directions here:  Jesus came DOWN at Christmas, he rises UP finally at the Ascension and sends his disciples OUT to minister in his name.  But in the story, the Holy Spirit doesn’t come DOWN to empower his followers until NEXT week, Pentecost.  So I tweaked the good reverend’s sermon title…and I am probably tweaking YOU ALL at this point with the curious geographic language because you and I no longer live in a DOWN UP DOWN world.  What do we make of all this?\\n\\tThinking chronologically in the Jesus story, we are in a strange place today.  Since Easter, following the death and resurrection accounts of Jesus, we have been hearing stories of his appearances to the disciples.  In a garden to Mary Magdalene, in a closed room to Thomas, on a beach cooking breakfast for the disciples, on a road to the town of Emmaus with a dejected couple.  And as if these accounts haven’t been hard enough to embrace – how in the world do we accept these outlandish post-resurrection accounts – today we have totally bizarre text about Jesus rising up into the air and disappearing.  This time for good.  Gone.   \\n\\tThe Ascension of Our Lord, as it is more formerly called in the church calendar, is a mystifying and even embarassing notion for most of us.  Isn’t this better left to our more high-church brothers and sisters?  Jesus floating up into the clouds?  Is this our cup of tea?  It’s hard enough for many of us to imagine Jesus’ resurrection, which apparently happened in the dark when no one was looking.  Here we have a live account that directly challenges our 21st century worldview, our values of scientific inquiry and our preference for logical explanations. .   How does this New Testament language from the first century inform our lives today?  \\n\\tIt may help to acknowledge that these texts were written in context of a premodern view of the universe, one in which people pictured themselves, for the most part, as living in a 3-tiered universe.  God was above the sky and the sun revolved around the earth.   Within this worldview, the first century author Luke begins his Gospel by describing God as sending Jesus “down” in the Virgin Birth story.  That’s why I reworked my sermon title to start with “Down.”  This is the metaphor that the New Testament offers us: Jesus arrives, somehow, from the realm of God’s mystery that is other than here, called “heaven.”  Now Luke concludes his Gospel with this closing scene of Jesus biding his disciples a final farewell and actually ascending up into the clouds, in full view of those left on the ground.  No Holy Spirit yet, although Jesus has promised it will come as Comforter and Advocate.  This scene reminds me of those wildly florid Italian Baroque paintings: lots of fluffy angels with big wings swirling around; Jesus’ bare feet disappearing into the clouds admist a burst of golden light; sad and  bewildered disciples craning their necks skyward.  Hmmmm….I’m not sure about this….\\n\\t This is where I find people like the controversial the author and retired Episcopal Bishop Spong to be helpful: In his book Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism.  Spong suggests that if we take the whole New Testament literally, it sometimes seems like God isn’t really very powerful in the Christian story. God begins to look like a clumsy “divine invader” if we only take these stories literally:  For example writes Spong: God apparently needed a special landing pad to come down from Heaven (the Virgin Birth), and then a special launching pad to get back to Heaven (the Ascension).  Down and Up.   Even the TV show “Star Trek” was more sophisticated: remember the “Transporter Room” with it’s special space-age machine?  Upon the command to “energize” the switch would be thrown, your molecules were disarranged and you were actually “beamed” to a different location with your molecules miracously rearranged and intact.   Why did God use such clumsy “transporters” as a virgin birth and floating back into the clouds?  Because the stories about these happenings have deeper and wider metaphorical meaning, suggests Spong. What might this story tell us about the all pervasive presence of God, as known through Jesus, that persists even today….and compels us to go OUT and serve in Jesus’ name?\\nDifferent Christians have different views about what happened to Jesus after he died, and about what it means for the Christian Church in the world today.  The more I get to know you, the more I learn about the theological diversity within this congregation.  As I have listened to you all speak about what drew you to Emmaus in the first place, many of you speak both about the sense of community and also the sense of openness and acceptance of different views about  the interpretation of Scripture and about what it means to be a Christian.  This is part of the “glue” that keeps you together, in spite of these differences; a “glue” that helps “support the weight of diversity” among you (p. 16, How to Live with Diversity in the Local Church, Stephen Kliewer).    \\n\\tI suggest we consider the story of the Ascension of Jesus as one way to understand some of the “glue” or the “foundation” that is holds open-minded Christians together today.  We might consider how New Testament also uses the word “exaltation” in referring to the ascension of Jesus.  This helps me move away from the location specifics.  How do we describe “exaltation” of something?  The Bible uses all kinds of metaphors to deepen our understanding and experience of God.   We find many references to God’s hands and feet and countenance throughout the Hebrew scriptures.  But these authors knew God did not have hands, feet and a face.  God was not some primitive seeming a super-human guy in the sky to them.   The “right hand of God,” the place where Luke describes Jesus as sitting after he ascends to heaven, was not a geographical locale in Luke’s mind.  He is trying to tell us about a huge mystery of Jesus’ “exaltation” after his physical death; Luke is trying to communicate that the earthy existence of Jesus is over but now humans have a new relationship with him that is not restricted to place and time.  The “right hand of God” describes a realm of power, of dominion and oversight; it tells us through metaphor that Jesus is now part of the sovereignty, the ruling, over all things.  This is why the pharse “Jesus is Lord” was so dangerous for the first century Christians to utter publically.  The Caesar was Lord and ruler over all things.  The corrosive values of Empire; domination, repression, acquisition, inequality, ruled the day. These early Christians challenged that world world view everytime they claimed Jesus presence, inspiration, teachings as being available to all. \\n“Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying; “don’t impose your faith or beliefs, but be ready to witness to the fresh and transforming experience of God you are having!”   Or put in the language I just shared with our children: take off the bib and put on the apron.  Come to church not to receive, but to learn how to serve others.  Be a part of a faith community where we work together on being accountable, where we speak it/we repent when we make mistakes, where we learn to forgive each other as we reach out to those in need beyond our doors.  Be part of an intentional community where people can disagree in love, where everyone gets to be heard, but “no one gets everything his or her own way all the time.” \\nThe story of the Ascension of Jesus reminds me that God’s unifying power, through the Holy Spirit, is present for us.  We each are challenged to continue Jesus mission, fueled by this Spirit; there is work to be done, and people to welcome into the fellowship.  Our intimate connection with the Spirit connects us one to another. It makes us “one.”  In turn, we are empowered to reach out to all those who long to be welcomed into a loving, diverse, uniting faith community. Thanks be to God!  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tHave you ever been asked this question:  Do you love Jesus?   This may seem like an unusual idea, or, perhaps this is a familiar question from your religious upbringing.  There are a number of Christian communities where members greet each other regularly with personal questions about one’s relationship with Jesus: “how is your walk with Jesus going these days?”   Maybe you have experienced questions such as these as a litmus test, a way of ferreting out if you were really saved.  Do you love Jesus?  I dare say it is not a question that emerges from the four European Protestant traditions that make up the United Church of Christ. We might even wince a bit at the question for various reasons.  Does it make us feel quite uncomfortable, our personal space a bit invaded, leaving our mind a tad befuddled?  Hmmm….Do I love Jesus?\\nI invite us to notice whatever feelings of unease or consternation, of even eagerness and joy, that the question might bring up for any of us.   And other questions might arise:  but what would this mean, if I loved Jesus?  How would I know if I do?  What does loving Jesus look like?   Why is this even important to discuss?  Try to stay with the initial question to your very own self, “Do you love Jesus?” as we ponder today’s scriptures together. \\nLet’s consider the Acts tale of Saul of Tarsus, who will later be identified by his Roman name, Paul and become a major spokesperson for the early church.  Saul, a learned Jew and son of a Roman citizen, never met the historical Jesus but he apparently hated his increasingly bold followers.  By this point in the mid-first century, the synagogues are having a problems continuing to incorporate either Jewish Christians or the growing number of Gentile Christians into their traditions and belief systems.   Saul had joined forces with those teachers of the Law who believed that the followers of Jesus were misguided and were a liability for the whole community.   \\nBut, on route to Damascus, Saul is suddenly overwhelmed with blinding light and a voice: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”  The voice, audible to both Saul and his traveling companions,  identifies itself as Jesus:  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting!”  Saul is blinded by the encounter and is instructed to proceed to Damascus and await further instructions.    There he is healed by one of the disciples, is baptized and begins to proclaim the Risen Jesus in the synagogues.  An astonishing turn-around.  We might wonder: What turns such enmity into affirmation?  At the extreme: What turns the actions of hate into love?\\nHas there been a time when this has happened in your own life?  There may have come a time for any of us when clinging to old patterns, settled ways of seeing and doing things, just did not work anymore:  Assumptions like… seeing our parents as the source of our own adult problems.   Thinking we can persist in our increasing use of a certain mind-altering chemical on a daily basis.  Bad-mouthing a previous spouse, misrepresenting our financial reality on our taxes, continually complaining about one friend to another friend.  We each have attitudes or behaviors where we have clung to old certitudes, ingrained habits, that no longer serve.  And then one day, it’s like the light comes on.  Wow, we mutter to ourselves, I’m seeing this totally differently!  \\nOn the road to Damascus, Saul is blinded by a brilliant flash and collapses. There comes a time when something seems to throw us to the ground; it converts us.  And if we are smart, we start groping around towards something new, stretching out towards the healing, moving from the self-loathing towards something very different.   \\nWhen we find Peter with a group of the other disciples by the Sea of Tiberias in today’s passage from John, its almost as if Jesus’ being among them had never happened. I can just imagine Peter turning dejectedly to his companions: “well….so much for being ‘fishers of men and women.’  I’m going back to fishing for fish.”  They put out their boat and labor all night.  But no fish.  \\nWhat is odd in John’s narrative is that the Gospel writer has already described several resurrection appearances up to this point.  These people, among others, have already encountered the Risen Jesus, talked with him, had the Holy Spirit breathed on them, been commissioned to go out and forgive in Jesus name.   But here, they don’t even recognize the stranger who calls out from the beach, saying: “hey, let your nets down on the other side of your boat.”  They start to strain against the huge load of fish in their nets, Abundance, overwhelming fish abundance, slithering out onto the deck.  “I have come that ou might have abundant life,” Jesus used to tell them.  Only at that point does an unnamed disciples recognize Jesus.  And suddenly a switch flips in Peter; it’s like a light goes on and Peter shouts, “It is the Lord!”  He throws himself into the water, thrashing towards shore, groping towards something,….Someone.  \\nBefuddled, the rest of the disciples do not understand until they actually have eaten breakfast together with the stranger on the beach.  And it will be in sharing the fish and bread, simple food like they had shared with their Lord many times before, that they recognize him.  “Come and have breakfast,” says Jesus.  Come and eat the most important meal of the day.  Come and eat the most important meal of your life, really.  Come, break your fasting, your denial of what you need; break your pattern of scarcity thinking.  “Come and have breakfast,” says Love.  And suddenly, the light goes on for them.\\nWiping crumbs from their beards, they probably began to talk.  Jesus is here with them; they have been knocked to the ground, thrown down from their assumptions that it was all over.  “Well, we figured we would just go back to fishing for fish,” they try to explain.  Jesus gazes at them with such tenderness, such compassion.  And then, the question: “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks.   \\n“What?  Why, yes, Lord; you know that I love you,” Peter answers, perhaps remembering the first time he denied even knowing Jesus during those terrifying hours following Jesus’ arrest.  \\n“Ah…well then feed my lambs,” says Jesus.  \\n“Feed your lambs…?” Peter scratches his head.  “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks again.  “Well, yeah, you know I love you!”  Peter mumbles, remembering how he lied to that woman in the Temple courtyard that awful day.  \\n“Tend my sheep,” replies Jesus.   All the disciples are staring at the two of them; what else is going on here?   But now Jesus is asking Peter again;  “Do you love me?”  And the light of comprehension starts dawning even brighter.   Peter finally sinks deep into the reality of his own forgiven self.  It’s as though Jesus is saying: “I am seeing you Peter, for all that you have been and all that you are.  I am loving you, Peter.  Can you open to that, can you stop clinging to your sorry old failed self?  Can you love me back?  Peter, do you love me?”  \\nAnd it all comes crashing down for Peter, doesn’t it?  “Lord, you know everything;” he cries.  “You know how I abandoned not only you, but how I abandoned that best self I came to be as your disciple.  You know it all, and you still want me to go out in your name and fish for people and forgive and tend and feed all those who hunger for you.  You know everything.  You know that I love you.”  \\nMaybe this is what conversion really looks like.  It isn’t suddenly having an intellectual certainty about a creed or belief or theological concept.  For whatever reason, a light goes on.  And in that dawning awareness, there is an opening of our hearts to seeing ourselves differently.  We may finally begin to see how the Risen Jesus is seeing us.  Come and get back to basics, says Jesus.  Come and eat breakfast; take in this nourishment that I know you and forgive and love you.  Such compassion for us, such eagerness that we will join him in the tending and feeding of those who hunger for God.  We are forgiven and restored to wholeness, so we can turn to this larger question Jesus asks of each of us: “Do you love me?”   \\nIt’s certainly a risky question to answer, because we won’t be able to just sit on the beach, all cozy around the fire.  Affirming our love for Jesus will always send us out.  We aren’t just asked to be like Jesus, to adhere to his teachings.  We are asked to follow him.  “Follow me,” Jesus says at the end of this encounter.  Not just a dead hero and teacher, but a living presence.  That’s what the Gospel writers themselves were experiencing.  That’s what they wanted to record.  Loving Jesus will commission us to follow this living presence.  Loving Jesus will invite us to move deeper into God’s hurting world, to forgive and to feed and to tend.    And we can thank God for that.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tWe follow this grieving and unnerved woman as she stumbles through the early darkness, looking for the body of her beloved Teacher and friend.   The Gospel of John has already carefully informed us in previous verses that her visit is not about bringing spices and completing the burial preparations.  Nichodemus, the Jewish religious leader sympathetic to Jesus’ cause, had already supplied pounds of myrrh and aloes the night Jesus was buried.  The other followers are apparently in hiding; surely the Roman soldiers will be looking for them too.  So what is Mary Magdalene up to in the dark?  As she approaches, she is stunned to see the closure to the tomb rolled away. Proceeding no further, she runs to get several of the other disciples.  Two of them come back with her, and peer into the cave-like enclosure.  They note the pile of burial clothes.  Curious, as these would probably have been still on Jesus’ body if someone had moved him to another location.  The men apparently believe the body is truly gone, but can’t make heads or tails of this.  They return to their homes.   Note: no one is expecting “resurrection” at this point.  \\n\\tMary stays rooted to the spot, weeping.  Even the cold comfort of seeing and touching, Jesus’ body again has been taken from her.  Through her tears, she looks into the tomb and encounters angelic beings who question her.  She suddenly senses a presence behind her.  Turning, she sees someone standing there, who repeats the angels’ question: “why are you crying?”  Not recognizing who this is, she pleads, “Sir, tell me where his body is.” Then this someone calls her by name: Mary.  In that moment, she recognizes him.  And the unrecognizable all of a sudden becomes incomprehensible – “oh my God, Teacher, it is you!” And Jesus sees how her love for him is grasping, still looking for a tangible corpse.  What she is now confronted with is an intangible aliveness beyond her wildest dreams (Cynthia Bourgeault, p. 130, Wisdom Jesus).  “Don’t hold on to me, don’t cling to me,” he tells her.\\n\\tThe Gospel writers want us to know that Jesus, despite all evidence of his dying, is now alive.  This challenging of the power of death itself is the most paradoxical part of the Easter claim for me.   Something dead is now alive.  Not a resuscitated body; this man who embodied God’s radically inclusive, unstoppable love was dead…and has now been transformed into a living entity.  And for several millennium, Christians have been saying much the same thing: we testify to this ongoing presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst, and it is making new life, transformation, possible in us.   \\n\\tThere is something almost ridiculous about this claim, in part because our best thinking can’t quite comprehend it.  In our world, death so often seems to have the last word.  How can it be that confronting violence, dead hopes and dreams, feeling dead inside, is not the final part of each of our stories?  This is the grown-up part of Easter, beyond spring bunnies and chocolate eggs.  It is almost the stuff of dreams, not unlike the one the Spanish poet, Antonio Machado records in his poem “Last Night As I Lay Sleeping.”  The idea of new life busting out of deadness is so fantastical and error-like, it has to come to him under the cover of sleep, when his conscious, linear-thinking brain is no longer in charge.  Hear his words:\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a spring was breaking\\nout in my heart.\\nI said: Along which secret aqueduct,\\nOh water, are you coming to me,\\nwater of a new life\\nthat I have never drunk?\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat I had a beehive\\nhere inside my heart.\\nAnd the golden bees\\nwere making white combs\\nand sweet honey\\nfrom my old failures.\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a fiery sun was giving\\nlight inside my heart.\\nIt was fiery because I felt\\nwarmth as from a hearth,\\nand sun because it gave light\\nand brought tears to my eyes.\\n\\nLast night as I slept,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat it was God I had\\nhere inside my heart.\\xa0\\t \\t\\n\\tMy mistakes, my failures, my deadness being transformed?  This can’t be right.  “Marvelous error,” Machado cries, over and over.   How can it be that these changes come to me, he wonders.  I dreamt I had a fiery sun giving light inside my heart.  That’s crazy!  “Last night, as I slept I dreamt, marvelous error, that it was God I had here in my heart.”  The spirit of the living God, inside of our hearts.  “Fear not,” said Jesus at his last meal with his followers, “I will be with you always.”\\n\\tCan dry hearts be replenished and warmed?  Can old failures be transformed?  Sometimes we get so caught up in the calculated logic of the world and what our conscious ego analyzes might be possible.  “I just can’t let go of that resentment, that disappointment, that mistake.”  We miss the possibility of our own inner healing and changing.   I often liken Easter morning to a cold glass of water – thrown in my face!  Because there has always been something too sudden, too bizarre about Easter.   Jesus is killed because he embodied God’s radically inclusive love so totally, that he became a threat to just about everyone.  Again and again, he refused to compromise; he would not set limits on God’s unstoppable love, forgiveness and acceptance.  \\n\\tI wonder if in that moment of hearing Jesus calls her name, Mary Magdalene finally recognizes her transformed self.   She is not just a woman frantically bereaved, torn from the person who embodied Gods’ radically inclusive love.  She is Mary, beloved disciple and forgiven one, a woman who has come to see her own old failures transformed.  One who came to know and accept her own precious self through her relationship with this Teacher and friend.  One who has known love and now is called to pour that love out to the world. Jesus is now present in a new and different way; life and God’s love is unstoppable.  Mary Magdalene gets it.  She will bring the message of resurrection back to the disciples, and she will be called by the early, pre-patriarchal church, “the Apostle to the Apostles.”  \\n\\tOur adult lives are full of self-doubts, and often a casual flippancy about what really matters.  As we are confronted again by the pain and violence of our world, it sometimes feels more natural to say that death does have the last word, In the midst of all this, we each yearn for a deeper sense of connection with the great Mystery around us.  We long for that wellspring of renewal and hope.  Water for our dryness, heat for our chill, light for our darkness.  For old failures to be changed into sweet honey. \\n\\tJesus is standing before us again, as he stood before Mary Magdalene on that garden path.  He is addressing each of us by name, recalling us to our own precious selves:  “Anne, here I am – I’m alive – my spirit now lives inside of you, it’s changing you in this very moment.  Now, what will be transformed in your life?”\\n\\tChrist has risen.  Christ is risen indeed.  Alleluia and Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOnce upon a time, there was a man who looked upon Christmas as a lot of humbug.  He wasn’t mean like the Grinch of Dr. Seuss, and he wasn’t  a lonely and miserly man like Charles Dicken’s Scrooge.  In fact, he really was a very kind and decent person.  He was generous to his family, honest in his business dealings and lovingly attentive to his elderly parents.\\n\\tBut the man just did not know what to do with the ideas, the beliefs about Christmas.   Although raised in the church as a child, he seldom attended church with his own family as an adult.  It was something about all the idea of the Incarnation, of God becoming human in Jesus that he would hear preached each December.  It just did not make sense to him and he didn’t want to pretend.  “I’m sorry to distress you, my dear,” he told his wife.   She would patiently reply, “oh my love, that’s alright.  You can come with your doubts.  I don’t understand it all either, it is such a Mystery this incredible connection between God and humans.  But the stories in the Bible seem true in such a deep, poetic sense.  I believe I see the heart of God when I hear about Jesus.”  Well, this sounded a bit muddled to the man, not quite logicial.  “Hmmmmm,” he replied.\\n\\tOn Christmas Eve one year, the man’s wife and children went into town to church for the late night service.  He declined their invitation to go with them.  “I’d feel like a hypocrite,” he explained.  I’ll stay at home and keep the fireplace stoked; I’ll wait up for you.”  “OK, Daddy, see you later,” said his children.\\n\\tShortly after his family drove away in the car, snow began to fall.  He went to the window and watched the flurries getting heavier and heavier.  “If we must celebrate Christmas,” he reflected, “it’s nice to have a snow-covered, white one.”  He watched the snowflakes glisten and catch on the bare tree branches, then went back to his chair by the fireside.  He read his newspaper and shook his head in dismay at all the ads for Christmas gifts; all the commercialism of the season troubled him too.  He wondered what this person Jesus would think about all that.\\n\\tThe room was quiet, except for an occasional snap of the burning logs in the fireplace and the russle of his newspaper.  Suddenly, he was startled by a dull, thudding sound. THONK!  It was quickly followed by a second thud, then a third.  THONK, THONK!  It was coming from the large picture window across the room, the one that faced out to the street.  At first he thought someone must be throwing snowballs at his window.  “Now, who in the world….” He muttered, heaving himself out of his deep chair.\\n\\tWhen he looked out the front door to investigate, the man found a flock of birds huddled together in the snow.  They were small birds and they looked pretty miserable.  They had been caught in the sudden snow storm.  In a desperate search for shelter that had apparently tried to fly through the warm light of his window!  What a pitiful sight they were!  \\n\\t“I can’t let these poor poor creatures lie there in the snow and freeze,” he thought, “but how can I possibly help them?”  Then he remembered the barn on their property, the one where his children’s pony was stabled and where the family kept a few chickens.  The barn would provide a warm shelter, with dry hay and away from the snow and wind!  He quickly put on his coat and snowboots and gloves, and tramped out through the deepening snow to the barn.  He opened the doors wide and turned on the the light.  He waited….but the birds didn’t come in the barn.  In fact, they didn’t even seem to notice as they huddled together.\\n\\t“Food will bring them in,” he thought.  So he hurried back to the house for bread, and crumbled it and sprinkled in on the snow, making a trail into the barn.  But to his dismay, the birds ignored the breadcrumbs and just continued to huddle and flop around helplessly in the snow.  \\n\\t“Good grief,” thought the man.  He then tried to shoo them into the barn by walking around and waving his arms.  But the birds, pretty confused by now, just scattered in every direction except into the warm, lighted barn.  “Rats!” exclaimed the man, “they must think I am a strange and terrifying creature!”  “I’m trying to help them and they are just scared of me!”\\n\\t“If only I could be a bird myself, just for a few minutes,” he muttered to himself.  “Perhaps I could lead them out of the cold and darkness, towards the light.”  Just then, church bells began to ring in the distance.  “It must be midnight,” he thought.  He just stood there, listening to the bells pealing out the joyful tidings of Christmas.  “If only I could become a bird, myself,” he mused, “I could talk to them and they would trust me and would lead them safely out of the cold and darkness…and into life.”  He looked at the birds and then at the barn door.  “I wonder, hmmmm,…”  And he found himself sinking down in the snow and actually kneeling, out there with the white snowflakes swirling around him….his heart slowly opening to something, to a Presence he couldn’t quite understand.     \\n\\tAnd from the back of his memory, from deep in his childhood, came the words of the carol, and he softly began to sing:  “O come let us adore him, oh come let us adore him, of come let us adore him, Christ the Lord.”   \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\t “Once to every man and nation.”  Once to every woman and nation, I would add.  In spite of its gender exclusive title, this hymn by James Russell Lowell never fails to stir and challenge me.  A 19th century poet, editor and diplomat, Lowell was the son of a Congregational minister.  Lowell was also an active abolitionist, working with his wife Maria White in the New England anti-slavery movement.  Our hymn is part of a longer poem called “The Present Crisis,” which Lowell published the poem in Boston in 1845, as a protest against US involvement in the war with Mexico. Lowell was convinced that land added to Texas would only increase the territory of permitted enslavement of certain humans. After a portion of the poem was set to music, it was often sung in many New England Congregational churches, which felt called to anti-slavery work. “Once to every man, woman and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side.”  These denominational ancestors of our United Church of Christ believed that the then prevailing “truth” of black people’s inherent inferiority to white people was a “falsehood.”  For them, “time (had truly) made ancient good uncouth.”  \\n\\nThe tone of the hymn is somber, even gruesome at times: we walk a path “by light of burning martyrs,” tracking “Jesus’ bleeding feet.”  Yet, I experience an odd mixture of feeling both chastened and hopeful as I sing the words, challenged again and again by the phrase, “new occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.” \\n\\nAs a nation, we are at an interesting confluence of “new occasions” this week, and I find myself wondering: “what new duties” are being revealed to us as disciples of Jesus? Tomorrow, our nation will again have the opportunity to reflect on the prophetic life and ministry of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  If we pause and listen, we might be challenged to focus again on the realities of poverty, racism and war that Dr. King so boldly preached about in the 1960’s, and that continue to plague our life together.  We are still in the tender aftermath of the contested police shootings of African Americans that have sent thousands of citizens out into our city streets in protest and sharply divided our nation.  We wade through more uproar about our criminal justice system, negative public discourse and life together as a sharply polarized nation.  We might find ourselves thinking about the healing and reconciliation, the “new duties,” that need to unfold for our country to be whole. What is the new occasion we find ourselves in as a nation, as a region, community here in the Twin Cities metro area in early 2015?  \\n\\n\\tOver and over in the Bible we hear stories of people being called out of one situation into something new.  New surroundings, new duties, new challenges, new futures.   This seems to be God’s way with humans, but I think we often find such calls surprising, unsettling, even confusing.  The account in First Samuel describes the call of young Samuel who thinks the voice speaking out to him in the night is that of Temple his mentor, the priest Eli.  It is a time in Israel’s history when there was great debate about whether or not they should have a king to rule over them.  For years, the judges and the priests had mediated between the people and God, guiding the Israelites in relative equality and stability.  But the young nation had ongoing problems with neighboring people (many of whose lands they were now occupying) and they wanted protection from their enemies.  For the sake of national security they wanted a king who would rule under God’s rule, and also gather standing armies to protect them.  Others worried that a monarchy would make them be like all other nations, with military conscription, a sharper division between rich and poor, heavy tax burdens and oppression from power hungry human rulers.   Unknown to Samuel at the time of his call, God will eventually guide him to choose Israel’s first king, Saul.  And Samuel would become the first in a long line of prophets who will be called upon to speak God’s truth to these future kings. \\n\\n\\tSamuel is only about 12 years old when it God calls him, but when Samuel finally figures out who is trying to get his attention in the middle of the night, he manages to sputter:  “Speak, for your servant is listening.” God entrusts Samuel with the difficult task of speaking truth to power right from the beginning.  He will have to speak words of judgment and accountability, about Eli’s sons transgressions as a priestly family: how they would keep the choice parts of the sacrificed meat for themselves and abuse poor women who came to the house of worship in dire need.  He will have to challenge future kings to care for the poor and the marginalized within their realm.\\t\\n\\n\\tI recently came across an account of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, which he delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\\xa0\\xa0Apparently, the singer Mahalia Jackson had called out to him with the words: \"tell them about the dream, Martin.\" Dr. King proceeded to move away from his prepared notes to speak of his dream of a different world for all of God\\'s people. \\xa0As we again approach the commemoration of Dr. King\\'s ministry on tomorrow, we might wonder about the things that can either constrict or encourage our dreaming and imagining a new future to which God calls us.\\n \\n\\t  When Jesus approached people at the beginning of his ministry, it does not appear that he had much to offer them.  There was no game plan beyond experiencing that the Kingdom of God was at hand. Something about Jesus, his demeanor, his teachings, allowed people to let go of predictability and certainty. When he said, “follow me,” they went with him.  These people were not told:  “change this about yourself,” but simply “follow me.”  Somehow, Jesus knew these people.  Somehow, God knew Samuel.  Somehow, other people are inspired by God and seem to know us and challenge us to dream new dreams about our future.  Has someone known you and called you out to envision a new call in your life?  Are you able to do this for someone else, perhaps someone whose vision, whose dreams need widening?  \\n\\n\\t“Come and see” Jesus said in the preceding verses when several of John the Baptist’s followers came over to investigate what Jesus was up to Jesus to his early followers; “come and see” says Philip as he invites Nathaniel to join them.  The words are better translated: “come and experience.”  What is Jesus inviting them to experience? God’s reign, where the first shall be last and the last shall be first, is at hand.  Where the poor will be fed and the captives released and the blind will see and the lame walk. \\n\\t \\t\\n\\tI remember being a young and politically naïve high school student living in suburban Washington DC the spring Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. The civil rights movement was an occasional topic of discussion in my family and my United Church of Christ congregation. But neither my high school social studies classes, nor my peers nor I were paying attention to a sanitation strike in Memphis, Tennessee.  What I remember so vividly from that difficult time, and the grief, violence and destruction that followed was a phone conversation with a friend the night Dr. King was killed.  Since my friend’s father was an FBI agent working for J. Edgar Hoover at the time, in keeping with his father’s views, my friend insisted that the assassination was a good thing as King was probably a Communist.  My education in the more subtle and persistent forms of racial tension was just beginning. \\n\\nYears later, I read part of Dr. King’s 1963 letter to uninvolved white clergy in the South, appealing for their active support of the civil rights movement: “We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence of the good people.”   I began to learn that my inherited whiteness had given me certain advantages and privilege throughout my life that I had never really recognized.  As a follower of Jesus, my ongoing personal challenge has been how to use this “currency,” this unearned power and privilege, to working to help heal racial injustice.   If you would like to join me in some more conversation about this, a small group of us will be meeting starting this Thursday evening.  (More information in your bulletin.)\\n\\n“New occasion bring new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth. Standeth God within the shadow keeping watch above his own.”  This God of ours not only keeps watch, but also continually tries to get our attention.  This God is calling each of us to new duties, as we become transformed by the presence of the Spirit of the Risen Jesus in our lives.  What new visions and new calls will emerge for each of us in these coming months?  For this congregation?  Let’s be in conversation together.  “Come and see,” says Jesus.  Amen.    ',\n",
       " '\\n\\tYour Discovery Team (the group of eight church members helping me guide our interim process, before you call a new pastor), has laid out a month of intriguing worship-work for you.  About 6 weeks ago, they held small groups on Sunday morning, in the midst of worship, focused on uncovering the core values your all hold.  Our values get played out in large and small decisions that guide our behavior as a church.  The intent was to come to better understand the core values, and the shared beliefs of this congregation – the who you are as a church, all of which will help tremendously in the eventual search for your new called pastor. \\n\\n\\tWhat did we discover about what this congregation values? We used this imagery from the Apostle Paul about the church being the Body of Christ – the visible reality of the presence of the Risen Christ in the world.  The groups were asked to imagine what the Body of Christ that is Falcon Heights Church UCC might be like in 2020.  What would characterize this church if it were vibrant, transformational and visible enough to catch the attention of a local journalist?  How might that future newspaper article describe what had caught the newspaper’s attention?  The top values that were chosen to describe a future vibrant and transformational congregation included:  Community, Spirituality, Love, Inclusive.  These were followed in priority by:  Laughter/Fun/Joy, Caring, Acceptance, Family, Mission, Justice.\\n\\n\\tYour Discovery Team decided that during June we would take one of the top four values each Sunday, explore the Biblical basis for these values and see what we mean by saying they are important to us.  We begin today, with the value of Community.   Inside your bulletins, you will find a bright orange card that invites you feedback.  In the next few minutes, I urge you to write some notes about what Community means to you at this point your life.  See if you can answer the question, from your perspective, “Community is……”   Is there a question, a wondering you have about Community?  Complete the second statement “Is Community…..?”  Put these in the offering plates when we receive our morning offering, and then join me and a few Discovery Team members, after worship, for some more informal conversation at our Round Table Chat about Community.\\n\\n\\tWe have no record of Jesus speaking directly about the value “community.”   While he had certainly been part of the local Nazareth community before his itinerant ministry, we never see him staying in one place long enough. How would he have coped with a crabby neighbor, a gossipy or a bossy synagogue member, or his own nuclear family?  But we have a strong record of Jesus talking about how God intends individuals and groups of people should interact with one another.  In today’s passage from Matthew he speaks of the need to stay “salty” and to “be a light to the world.  Jesus doesn\\'t say, \"If you want to become salt and light, do this....\" Or, \"before I\\'ll call you salt and light, I\\'ll need to see this from you....\" Rather, he says both simply and directly, \"You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world.\"  I hear this as description of what it means to be Christian community, where we are followers of this Jesus.\\n\\t“How on earth does salt lose its saltiness,” the Biblical commentator David Lose asks.  Doesn’t it just dissolve and disappear?  And what’s with this “don’t hide your light under a bushel” business?  You end up either burning the straw bushel basket or your light, lacking oxygen, goes out.  Again, the light dissolves and disappears.   “Maybe Jesus is implying,” continues Lose, “that one can lose one\\'s status as salt and light. Or maybe he\\'s just naming the absurdity of the possibility of losing one\\'s character as salt and light in order to underscore the reliability and resilience of the gift he bequeaths.\" (from Working Preacher website, 1/30/11, )  \\n\\tThe other thing to notice about being salt or light as a community is that neither of these, salt nor light, are really useful alone.  The importance of each is in what they do when applied to others.  The salt brings flavor, and can actually preserve things.  The light illuminates.   People coming together in Christian community are not there for themselves.  That would seem to be Jesus’ perspective.  This would mean that we gather together for others, not ourselves.  We come for the others among us and others still outside our doors.  This has some pretty wild implications.  For starters, it means that Sunday worship is not just for our individual entertainment or even our own personal spiritual comfort.   Worship is for the proclamation of the Gospel, in a variety of ways that make it possible for all kinds of people to hear the Good news and connect with God’s transforming power.  \\n\\tBut, given how long people are living these days, we have at least five different generations in our congregation.  Each with different life experiences, perspectives on the world and family and work, favorite music, and assumptions about church. We are all going to have different comfort zones and interest levels when it comes to music in worship, the way we pray together, how we move around this space, how edgy the sermons get when it comes to social justice issues, what the arrangement of the Sanctuary furnishings looks like, how decorous or how rowdy we get in here.  The choice to have a blended service like we do, where everyone experiences something that resonates with them but no one feels comfortable the whole time, can be very challenging.  It entails sacrifice on everyone’s part.  Especially as we seek to incorporate more elements that will relate to younger generations (people younger than me!).  Should being in community entail personal sacrifice?  I think so.  \\n\\tLet’s move on to the Apostle Paul for some perspective on this.  Paul, the early church outreach guy.  His letters to the new worshiping communities that he establishes all over Asia Minor are urgent, filled with lots of directives, and frankly sound sort of bossy.  But I tell you; he is on to something here when he talks about the faith community as being the incarnated Body of Christ in the world.  If you ever wondered if church is just a social club or a do-gooder community center, well look out.   The spirit of the living Christ, the Messiah, God’s anointed one, is embodied in the worshipping community of the followers of the Jesus Way.  That’s us.  In my view, that doesn’t make us better than anyone else.  We do not have a monopoly on righteousness or eternal life; our religion is not the only way to connect with God. But as the church community, we understand ourselves as the living manifestation of the Risen Christ.  And as we live together as part of the Body of Christ, we are slowly formed and changed and transformed into being more loving, forgiving, daring people.  \\n\\tWe accept that we bring different gifts to this Body, this community.  We know the Body can get wounded, and we seek its healing.  We don’t just say things are all better now because everything seems a little calmer after a time of hurtful conflict and strong financial pledging has resumed.  We realize that community is not just about being nice, but about being accountable to one another for our behavior and what we say.  Have we injured someone?  What would it look like to reach out and have some healing conversations?  Has someone injured us?  What would it look like to stop sitting on the bitterness and to reach out in the hopes for some mutual understanding and possibly forgiveness?  Not to prove your point.  On the contrary.  Perhaps to be curious about, to better understand, some one else’s differing perspective.   \\n\\tThese are some of the Biblical foundations of community.  I invite you to take a few moments and jot down some of your thoughts and questions about community.  Please them in the plate; then join us a Coffee Hour for some more informal discussion.  Let’s keep exploring about the value of community together.  Amen.\\n(Note: David Lose is a former preaching professor at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, MN and currently serves as President of Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia,)',\n",
       " '\\tIn these cold depths of dark winter, the season of Epiphany continues to unfold.  Spring and Easter are far off in the future.  From the icy weather to the unsettling news of violence and suffering throughout our world…. sometimes in January it seems that darkness is overcoming our sources of illumination, energy, healing and empowerment.  In a curious syncronicity, symbolic language about darkness and light weaves through our Common Lectionary scripture texts this morning, passages that are being read in Christian churches around the world today.  From the prophet Isaiah writing in the tumultuous mid-8th century BCE, ancient Israel is promised they will move from their time of darkness, oppression and distress under the Assyrian occupation.  God promises that there will be a day when the world will be shaped by the light of righteousness and justice and peace.  Centuries later, the Gospel writer Matthew sees these promises fulfilled as Jesus who bursts upon the scene.  Quoting Isaiah, Matthew reminds his own late first century community that all across the region, Jews and Gentiles who have “sat in darkness have seen a great light.”  The apostle Paul pleads with his contentious, arguing congregation at Corinth to “be united in the same mind and the same purpose.”  We are drawn deeper into this exploration of the “epiphany” or “manisfestation” of Jesus as a “light” to the world.  How might this image of “light in the darkness” bring us together in ministry as a church?  \\n\\n\\t“In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.”  This ancient Jewish poetry comes down to us in the Book of Genesis, oral tradition finally recorded in writing long before either Isaiah or Jesus’ time.  Similar to Creation stories from various traditions around the world, this tale also begins with images of a great darkness, an embryonic shadow place devoid of light.  “Then God said, let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.”  Over the centuries, new storytellers come to describe emerging pictures of Creation, ones “swimming in stories about fireballs and photons and light.”  Matthew Fox, theologian and author, has been part of a world wide movement that invites these diverse understandings, different languages of the nature and purpose of Creation, into fruitful dialogue.  Since the early 1980’s, this Catholic priest pushed out on the edges of Christian theology, drawing interfaith groups of religious leaders, spiritual teachers and scientists together to explore these different ways of describing our world and its purpose.  Fox’s description of a Creation-Centered Spirituality, was based on the notion that Biblical creation stories are about an “original blessing” and not, as some early Christian church fathers had decided, about “original curse of original sin.”  Silenced from the Vatican and then defrocked from the priesthood finally in 1993, this visionary activist has gone on to inspire both environmental activism as well as the spiritual lives of many progressive Christians. It is in conversation with several physicists, that Fox invites us to consider both the metaphoric and scientific significance of light.  Hear his description of creation from his book One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths:  \\n\\tFifteen billion years ago, in a great flash, the universe flared forth into being.  In each drop of existence a primordial energy blazed with an intensity never to be equaled again…In the beginning the universe is a great shining that expands rapidly and then explodes into hundreds of billions of dark clouds…\\nLater, a hundred billion galaxies light up with a splendor new to the universe.  The beginning of the universe is a smooth, intense flame.  A few billion years later the large-scale structure of the universe glows in great sheets of galaxies and in their intersections in long, spidery filaments of sparkling worlds.  \\n\\t“You are to be a light to the nations,” God will tell our Biblical ancestors.\\n“I am the light of the world….and you are the light of the world,” Jesus will go on to teach.   Scientists show us that all matter is actually slow-moving light; we exist at all because of the light.  Matthew Fox describes how “light drives all energy systems.  Plants and we eat light, breathe light, drink light and transform light into energy.”  During the middle ages, Jewish mystics writing in the Kabbalah, will describe that the creation of human beings is “attributed to sparks gathering….some sparks of light adhering and some remaining hidden throughout the world, sparks of holiness (suffusing) and intermingling with everything in the world.”  Is it no wonder that Albert Einstein admitted in the early part of the last century that “all I want to do is study light.”\\n\\tAs I consider the light metaphors for the divine and for illumined understanding throughout the world religions, I am struck by this paradox of our human existence:  Erik Erikson, the 20th century developmental psychologist describes it well as he wrote how religion manages to “elaborate on what feels profoundly true even though it is not demonstrable; (religion) translates into significant words, images and codes the exceeding darkness whichgt surrounds human existence, and the light which pervades it beyond all comprehension.” (quoted p. 11, John Shea, Stories of God).   In choosing to follow the Jesus way, among all the religious choices in the world, we are somehow “called to both share the light that we can see and feel; and we are also to share the light that we can only imagine.”  Stephanie Paulsell, professor at Harvard Divinity School writes this as she describes how Isaiah pushes the people of Israel outward, “outward to the coastlands, outward to the ends of the great, wide world…promising that following the light will lead them ever more deeply into the life of the world…to those who have been waiting for God’s light to break in upon their darkness.”  (Feasting on the Word, p. 270, Year A, Volume I.) \\n\\tSo Jesus approaches some fishermen by the Sea of Galilee, people he probably knew well living in the town of Capernaum, and on that particular day issues an invitation:  “Follow me and I will make you fish for people.”  Not, believe this or that, and you will get into heaven.  But follow me, and I will show you how to connect with people and share this light of God’s good news.  The Kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God’s righteousness, mercy and peace, is drawing near.\\t\\n\\tThe more I think about where you are as a congregation in this transition time, in this time between decline and renewal, I realized that the invitation offered by Jesus has got to be the starting point for the change you seek.  The starting point is not new programs, it’s not being an open and affirming congregation, it’s not refurbished rooms, it’s not even new mission projects, it’s not some surprise donor giving a huge gift, it’s not even hiring a wonderful new minister.  All these, of course, matter….but they are not where you start if you want to renew the ministries of a congregation.  The starting point is within you.  It’s within each of us, as we seek to be light to the world.   The starting point for the renewal of the ministries of this church is in each of you as you seek to follow the Word of God as outlined in the scriptures, and as you seek to follow the Living Word of God in the person of Jesus.   At the start, it’s not about church growth, it’s about the deepening of your relationship with the light.   It’s the unity of mind and purpose that comes from seeking to explore and be this light. \\nJesus invites people to experience the light of God’s transformative love and to share it with others. \\n\\tIn everything we do in the life of our congregation, we have to ask ourselves this question:  will others see the light of God’s love and compassion in us?  In this way, will they see Jesus?  Will we see Jesus in the way we interact with each other, not just as we cheerfully pass the peace in worship, but in the way we don’t ignore people at coffee hour, the way we smile encouragingly at the young parent with the squirmy child?  Will people see the light of Jesus in our deliberations in the Church Council and Annual meeting, in our conversing the newcomer at coffee hour, in our Bible study or discussion groups, in the ways we generously share our financial resources, in the way we shine a light on places of darkness and suffering in the community and world around us?  Will there be honest and respectful dialogue among us, as we seek to both honor our diversity of perspectives yet still be “united in the same mind and same purpose?”   The medieveal Jewish mystics spoke of “raising the sparks of the potent energy of the divine ideal.”  I’ll be interested to see what gets “sparked” around here, in the months and years ahead!\\n\\tJesus issued both invitation and promise by the Sea of Galilee, as he began his ministry and as he does with us now.  He invites us to follow him into the unknown places of our lives, illumined by the light of his teachings and continued presence.  And he promises that we will be changed, “sparked;” we will be transformed.  We will be able to draw in others to know his power and love. “Follow me,” says Jesus.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world, and a desire to enjoy the world.  This makes it hard to plan the day.\\nImprove or enjoy the world?  Savor or save it?  Am I going to reach out in some kind of service to others, or reach in with a more contemplative immersion in God’s glorious creation, quiet soaking in God’s Word, meditative reflection on God’s presence in my life?  Where does a faithful Christian focus?  Inreach or outreach?  Where does a faithful church focus?  Last Sunday, we explored Jesus’ story of the Good Samaritan, and Jesus reminder to the religious scholar that God wants us to love God and our neighbor through our compassionate actions.  “Go and do!” Jesus admonished him.   Improve or enjoy? Save, or savor?  Take care of others or focus inwardly?  Finding a balance between these two ways of being causes considerable debate in many churches.  It influences time spent on ministry programs, what is preached and taught, and how church budgets are constructed and spent.\\nThe Amos prophecy and the Mary/Martha story highlight two different parts of the religious life.  Reaching out in service to others, reaching in to connect with God’s purposes through study and prayer.  But which is most important in bringing us closer to God and God’s call to faithful living? \\t\\nThe Amos passage is tough to hear.  A stomach-churning read, filled with vivid and brutal depictions of God’s coming judgment on the northern kingdom of Israel during the prosperous early eighth century BCE.  The prophet Amos is appalled by his wealthy nation’s religious pomposity and their disregard of their poor and needy. He likens them to abundantly ripe bowl of summer fruit that has reached its peak and is about to come to a rotten end.  He doesn’t mince words about God’s relentless judgment that will befall the people.  The people’s sins are described as moral failures of social injustice. Those with power and wealth have cheated the poor and trampled the needy in their midst.  God has had enough of this and Amos describes God as saying: “I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.”  Historically, the northern Kingdom will soon fall before the military might of the invading Assyrians.  Is there a cause-and-effect connection between social injustice and survival of a nation? Amos seemed to think so.  \\nIt would be easy to dismiss such passages as evidence of Hebrew Scriptures’  - the Old Testament’s - preoccupation with harsh law, judgment and God’s wrath.  It is often assumed that in contrast, Christian scriptures in the New Testament are filled with love, compassion and God’s mercy.  Why read the Old Testament, as we call it.  For starters, the Hebrew scriptures were important to Jesus; he quoted them all the time.  In dismissing them, we may miss the reminder that God loves us enough to tell the truth about us and our behavior.  Throughout Jewish history, God’s judgment is always intricately linked to God’s compassion and mercy.  Perhaps the word “judgment” has become corrupted for us, because we have experienced the pain and exclusion that so often comes from human judgment.  We each have endured critical words, shaming expressions and rejecting behavior.  We have been wounded by human judgment.  And throughout Christian history, human assumptions and judgement have been projected onto God.  But there may be a clue about the outreach and in reach question, the save or savor dilemna, if we better understand God’s judgment of us.  God’s judgment is always about healing and new life. \\nWhat happened in Amos’ time is not unfamiliar to us.  We live in a prosperous nation where the gap between rich and poor continues to widen and the resources of adequate healthcare, education, jobs and housing become increasingly scarce for even hard-working people on the margins.  A board member of the food shelf recently told me they estimate that 10% of Cook County residents are “food insecure.”  Faced with these many needs, we can volunteer, do political advocacy and give our charitable donations, but we may still feel disconnected from God.  The author Corinne Ware writes in her book on the contemporary practice of ancient Benedictine spirituality: “Acts we do in obedience to our highest values are good things, and they enrich our lives and the lives of others.  Scripture says that such conduct ‘pleases God.’ That is not guarantee, however, that we will feel God’s presence with us, long term.  The ‘something more’ that we seek is that sense of always being accompanied, of God-with-us at all times and not special moments only.” (Corinne Ware, St. Benedict on the Freeway, p. 25).  The “something more” appears to come from the in-reach part, the savoring of life, which brings us to the Mary/Martha story. \\nThe Gospel author Luke, writing some 40-60 years after Jesus’s death, probably included this short vignette as an example of true discipleship.  He intends to guide his community of Christians on what is most important as they seek to follow the spirit of the living Christ in their midst.  In the telling, Luke compares two types of behavior; he lifts up two priorities for anyone who would seek to follow in the way of Jesus.   There is the active-seeming priority of doing service to others, as exemplified by Martha’s serving; the saving part.  There is the more passive-seeming priority of listening to and reflecting on Jesus teachings, as observed in Mary’s quiet listening at Jesus feet; the savoring part.   It’s a deceptively simple story that can easily serve as a put down of traditional women’s roles and of the person who always ends up in the kitchen.   Let’s see what was going on in this dinnertime drama.\\n\\tJesus arrives at Martha’s house for a visit and a meal.  Mary, Martha’s sister, immediately sits at Jesus’ feet, taking the position of a disciple, and quietly listens to his teaching.   Martha, the homeowner and host, is busy getting dinner ready for her honored friend and teacher.  And, she soon begins to sound frazzled.  Perhaps we can relate: Eager to make a big to-do in our hospitality efforts, focused on details behind the scene of an important family or church event, we sometimes can lose track of the real focus.  We become understandably resentful of those who just sit and chat, while others of us set-up and clean-up a church meal, mow the lawn, work hard in the meetings, carry the trash barrel to the street.  But food needs to get to the table so Jesus and his friends can eat!  \\n\\tBut as Luke tells it, Martha has become busy with “many tasks.”  The word “task” in Greek is “diakonein,” which is elsewhere in the New Testament the word used to describe Christian ministry or the role of deacon.   Apparently, Christian discipleship is about serving.  But here, the serving has become a problem and it has distracted Martha.  She gets exasperated, and we soon realize how off-centered she has become. One of the results is that she doesn’t confront her sister Mary directly, “oh Mary, I could use a little help here, please!”  She has taken on too much, and now resents her sister choice of listening to Jesus talk. Notice how Martha deals with her frustration.  She “triangles” someone else into the conflict.   Triangles happen all the time in families and in church communities and they are hard to avoid.  Instead of approaching Mary directly, Martha “triangles” Jesus: “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me,” Martha demands.   She doesn’t suggest to Mary that they both work to quickly get dinner on the table then they can all sit and listen to Jesus.    Maybe Martha wanted the table set just so, and the dishes prepared as only she could do it.  Whatever it was, her expectations and her anxiousness collide with the reality that only a simple meal is needed.  And she doesn’t face the conflict directly; she goes sideways with her anger.  \\n“Martha, Martha,” says Jesus.  We will never know the actual tone or the expression on Jesus’ face in this conversation.  Perhaps we can hear exasperation and even challenging judgment in his voice.   But I also hear compassion as Jesus calls her to new life. “Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things…few things are necessary, there is need of only one thing.”  Jesus alludes here to both a simple meal and a singular focus.  “Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”  At this dinner hour, Jesus judges Martha and he challenges her.  He calls her back to her true self.  Not unlike Amos reminding the people of northern Israel of their covenant with God, their call to be a just society and a light to the nations.\\t\\nTo save or savor, to improve the world or to enjoy the world.  The choices will confront us daily, and one is not necessarily better or more holy than the other.  But living in the Kingdom of God calls for a singular focus, says Jesus.   “Few things are necessary” Jesus reminds us.  Sitting at Jesus’ feet, our daily prayer and soaking in the Word, keeps us from getting distracted as we make difficult daily decisions about our actions.  God’s merciful judgment will tell us the truth in love.  Thanks be to God.   Amen.',\n",
       " '\\nThis stretch of days right after Christmas is always a bit strange.  We return to this sanctuary in the broad daylight after the heightened anticipation of the weeks of Advent, the joyous overflow of costumed children in the Christmas pageant, the poignant music, flickering candles and shining faces of Christmas Eve.  Here today, it’s a bit like being in a theater after the house lights come up.  The show is over, we say to ourselves, and the evergreens and poinsettia décor begins to seem a bit familiar.  For some among us, there is a wash of relief, as houseguests head home, diets return to normal, decorations will begin to be packed-away.   The frenzy of festivity, and even great joy, can be exhausting.  For some among us, Christmas is an unusually trying, lonely or sad time; January brings a welcome blank slate where one doesn’t have to fake the holiday cheer.\\n\\tAt some deeper level in this last week of December, we might wonder if “Christmas,” whatever it is spiritually that might unfold in us during this Christian holiday, has really happened.   In what way did  “Christmas” happen in me this year? – I ask myself.  If Christmas is more than the commercialization of a winter feasting festival, if Christmas is the celebration of God’s incarnation in the world through Jesus, then we might each wonder:  in what new way did I encounter the living God, the Creator of the Universe, this year?  Where have I been touched? Where have I been challenged?  What has shifted in me…in perspective, in belief or attitude, in my hopes, in my fears?  And what about that?  How will this encounter be made manifest in my life in this coming year?  In what ways do we each try and resist this work?  The poet Howard Thurman wrote about how “the work of Christmas” begins just at this point.  \\nWhen the song of the angels is stilled,\\u2028\\nWhen the star in the sky is gone,\\u2028\\nWhen the kings and princes are home,\\nWhen the shepherds are back with their flock,\\u2028\\nThe work of Christmas begins:\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nTo find the lost,\\u2028\\nTo heal the broken,\\u2028\\nTo feed the hungry,\\u2028\\nTo release the prisoner,\\u2028\\nTo rebuild the nations,\\u2028\\nTo bring peace among brothers,\\u2028\\nTo make music in the heart.\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Search for Common Ground, p.104\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Rev. Dr. Howard Thurman\\n\\t\\t\\tCivil rights leader, college chaplain and theologian\\n\\nWhat will it look like for each of us, for this congregation?  This is the stuff of exploring a new vision for the ministry of Emmaus:  If we are to find the lost and the broken in Vienna, in the surrounding communities, well….who is lost and broken?  What do they need from a local church?    We already do a lot to feed the hungry locally, but why are so many working families still needing food?  What’s is going on systemically around here and what might we become advocates for food justice as a church?  And what about releasing prisoners?  That sounds dangerous, illegal even.  Who is imprisoned and why in our mission field?  This is the larger question of who is our neighbor NOW?  What does it mean to us that certain populations are way over-represented in our local and national penal system?  And how about this work of Rebuilding nations?  Bringing peace among brothers and sisters?  That sounds overwhelming and impossible.  But what small part might we do as a congregation in relation to this Biblical imperative?  To make music in the heart:  bring it on, Emmaus Choir!  Infuse us with renewed energy, O Emmaus House Band!  And what else might be the new music we hear and sing this next year that stretches our imaginations and deepens our ability to celebrate and worship God?    \\n\\tThe 12 Days of Christmas, this period between Christmas Day and the Feast of Epiphany which follows, give us some time to ponder how we are going to practice Christmas among us and through us.  In the weeks ahead, we will consider the few Biblical records we have about this new baby, with an eye to his adult ministry to come.  While little is known about Jesus’ infancy, our Common Lectionary reading for this first Sunday after Christmas is curious and a bit unnerving.  Like a bucket of cold water, the Gospel of Matthew splashes this chilling story of King Herod’s paranoia and cruelty up in our faces.  Joseph is warned in a dream of the danger facing his little son, and flees with his family to Egypt.  After the revelry and delight of Christmas, we are Biblically faced with a reality which sounds all too contemporary: refuges fleeing tyranical and violent governments, desperately looking for safety and solace.   Might there be some small way we could assist refugees pouring our of Syria?  Who among us might feel called to check the UCC Global Missions website this afternoon, or search the internet for possible avenues of assistance?  Perhaps call up someone at Rock Spring Congregational UCC Church in Arlington and find out how we might join them in the work they are already doing to aide these refugees?\\n\\tAnother author and Presbyterian minister, Eugene Peterson, puts the the practice, the actual work of Christmas in a helpful light for me, and helps me understand why I sometimes resist this hard work:  He writes “the Christian life is not about us; it is about God.  It is not about fulfilling our potential or getting blessings.  It is not even about belief or actions, even though when we follow Jesus sooner or later we will feel compelled to do something.  The Christian life is not about us; it’s about God.”  Peterson is describing how the ongoing work of Christmas is about being in on, participating in what God is doing….and we can’t participate in God’s slow and urgent work if we insist on doing it our own way. (paraphrase from Eugene Peterson, Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places: a Conversation in Spiritual Theology).\\n\\tHow do we push through our own resistance to God with us?  The answer is disarmingly simple, and probably right under our nose:  we engage in God’s patient and urgent work in the world.  We do this as we pay attention to how the Holy Spirit dwells within us and forms us, shifts our priorities from “gettings things and getting things done.” (Peterson)\\n\\tJesus, Emmanuel, “God with us.” God “dwelling formationally in us.”  (Peterson)  We may shake our head, turn and go home, as we hear the scriptures this morning: words of promise about a future that has not yet unfolded.  Nothing appears to have changed in this Biblical story with Jesus’ birth: the conniving and cruel King Herod is still on his thrown, Caesar still rules with an iron fist from afar.  What is this promised future of which these angels, shepherds and wisemen at the manger have spoken?\\n\\tThe work of Christmas, of God’s reign being manifest here on earth, is slow and it is mostly quiet.  It will often seem that the rich and powerful command the day; that doing things faster and more efficiently will bring us success and happiness.  For starters, we can watch out for our resistance; it will lie in our propensity to choose shortcuts, things that are fast and easy, whereas God’s ways are more often slow and yet urgent.  Notice how we continue to resist anyone who challenges our right to everything from fast food to our fast vehicles that guzzle foreign oil.   We will probably resist the idea that vulnerability and powerlessness is the center of the Good News of God’s salvation.  We will want it to be about pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, or all of us banding together to crush evil rulers and the enemies of our way of life; \\nWhat has happened to you and me since Christmas Day?  The world around us looks pretty unchanged, unsaved as it were.  And yet we too have seen and tasted a “promised future.”   May that future continue to unfold among us and through us; may the “work of Christmas” begin.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOnce upon a time there were two young fish swimming along together in the ocean.  They passed an older fish who called out to them, “how’s the water, boys?”  The two young fish kept swimming and looked at each other.  “Huh?” said one of them.  And the other one replied, “what the heck is WATER?”\\n\\tWater is all around us everyday, its all inside of us…it’s easy to become unaware of water.  To take it for granted.  That’s one reason we celebrate water from so many different places today.  \\n\\tBut back when we were little tiny babies inside our mother’s, our first sensations were of the floating in the water of her womb.  We heard the watery whoosh of her heartbeat.  The gurgle of her tummy after she ate her dinner.  As we grow, our body continues to be mostly water.  Even our brains are 80% water and rests in a watery-cushion that protects it from getting jostled around too much inside our skull.   Our planet Earth is covered with a lot of water, so much so we should probably call it Planet Water.  Astronauts have looked back at Earth from space and told us it looks like a blue marble hanging in the sky.  And scientists tell us that a long long time ago, our ancestors actually lived and breathed in the water….Only recent, 375 million years ago, did they evolve and grow arms and legs and were able to crawl up on dry land.  \\n\\tWhen Jesus walked around on Earth, about 2000 years ago, he showed up in a place that didn’t have a lot of water.  Dry and deserty, water was mostly found in springs that came up out of the ground, wells that people would dig….the water was mostly underground.  People would save it in cisterns and big stone jars.  But the tastiest, freshest water was water that was moving, flowing, which they all called “living water.”  Did you notice in the Bible passage that Jesus talks about “living water?”  “Out of the believers hearts shall flow streams of living water.”  That sounds kind of strange.  What can this mean?\\n\\tJesus said this in the middle of a big festival at the Temple in Jersalem.  It was a celebration of the harvest, and people came from all around.  Musicans, people singing, processions with flaming torches.  Very exciting.  The Temple priests, their ministers, would go to a special pool of water in the city and fill big Gold pitchers with fresh water.  They would bring them back into the Temple and pour them into huge silver bowls, saying prayers thanking God for the water that brought the harvest, and asking that God’s spirit would pour down on them.  In the middle of all this hoopla and commotion, Jesus cries out  _______\\n\\tI’ve been reading a neat book recently written by a marine biologist about water.  He is famous for helping revive sea turtle populations down in Western Mexico.  But more recently he has been talking to brain scientist about how being around water affects how our brain works and how we feel.  He calls his book Blue Mind.   The author says that sometimes we run around with our brain all fired-up with stress.  All these hormones get released in us and we are ready to fight or run away, just like our ancestors long ago when faced with a mountain lion!  He calls this Red Mind.  When our brain acts that way it can helps us get out of danger, but most of the time we’re not stressed about a mountain line.  We’re stressed about traffic or our jobs or homework or our bothersome little sister.  Being in Red Brain can get pretty exhausting and we don’t make good decisions.  \\n\\t The author says we need a lot of time in Blue Brain mode, and water is just the thing to help us.  It seems that part of how our brains have developed over the years to solve big problems and be really creative has been because of our contact with water.   And that water may be the most important thing in nature that helps us stay connected to the natural world.  \\n\\tWater can sometimes be scarey: crashing wave knocks you over, pool water goes up your nose.  The waters of a flood or storm can be dangerous.  But brain scientists are reminding us that we need a number of things from water besides drinking it:  Why is the ocean so beautiful to look at on a sunny day?  We need to see the color blue of water because they have found looking at blue soothes us and inspires confidence.  Why do I sleep better if I hear a river rushing over rocks or the sounds of waves crashing on the shore?  We need to hear water as it moves rhythmically, because this moves us our brain into a relaxed state.  Watching fish swim in an aquarium or fish bowl,  watching sunlight dance on top of the water or along the bottom of a pool….Brain scientiests say all of these experiences rest us, calm us, bring us an increase in our happiness and sense of well-being.   \\n\\tJesus said that “out of the believers heart will flow streams of living water.”   He said out of your heart, your gut, the center of your being, will flow positive emotions and sustained attention.   Maybe he meant if we lean into our connection with Jesus and his teachings, amazing things will flow into us and out of us.  Love, respect, peacefulness.  All the things our world needs more of.\\n\\n\\tBeing near water, touching water, being in water is something most of do everyday.  Indians from the Yakima Nation in Washington State live along the Columbia River, and have long known the power of water in their lives.  When they wake up they take a sip of water.  When they go to sleep at night that is that last thing they do: take another sip of water and say of prayer of thanks for this gift.   What simple water rituals might become part of something you do each day?  Are there paintings or photographs on your walls at home of water, the ocean, lakes or rivers?   Bless yourself with water as you wash in the morning or before bed.  Turn on the tap and feel the rush over your hands.  Imagine God’s loving spirit pouring living waters into your heart, you pouring living waters of hope and love out to others.  \\n\\t\\t\\n',\n",

As if saying farewell after two years together as interim pastor and congregation wasn’t unsettling enough, and the new settled pastor hasn’t even been chosen yet…..now we have all the uncertainty and potential damage and danger, inconvenience, expense, of a huge wind and rain storm!   We channel our anxiety into a flurry of necessary preparations, which is certainly prudent.  But a part of us may just want to hold our breath and screw our eyes shut until this is over.  Gracious.  \\nThe question for the Church, in times like this, is not “where is God” or “why is this happening to us?”   God is right here, surrounding and within each of us and all of us together, as always.   And if we want answers to the “why” we best go to the weather channel and consult the meterologists for the latest on this “perfect storm.” (I hear Jim Cantori has already checked into the Cambridge Hyatt, which is never a good sign!)  But I do not believe that God “sends” storms upon us or make beloved pastors leave, to punish or even to teach us lessons.   Being subject to chaotic weather is part of what it means to live on a planet that is still being created, still evolving.  You and I agree to being part of the weather simply by being human and living on the Earth!  Having an interim pastor leave is part of an agreement that we made when I first arrived over two years ago.  The members of this church and I agreed that we wouldn’t be wooing each other during this interim time, in hopes of a future permanent match.  We would do ministry together and be honest with one another about the state of this congregation and what we sensed God was calling you all to next, learning about what kind of new leadership you would need to take you into that envisioned future.  \\nSo, if we affirm God is in the midst of all that is happening this morning and we aren’t going to dwell on “why is God doing this to me?” then where do we turn?  Where do we find hope and encouragement?  I suggest we ask ourselves:  What might God be saying to us, revealing to us, in the middle of all this unsettling turmoil?  I suppose we can either get really sad about endings like my leaving or uptight and anxious about unknowns like hurricanes barreling down on top of us.  OR .….we can get curious and consider our circumstances in the light of today’s Biblical text, from the perspective of our faith in God’s goodness and constancy.   I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears, says the Psalm portion we just read.  That’s what we do in worship, we seek the Lord together, through singing, praying and considering our sacred texts from the Bible.   Let’s turn to this reading from the Gospel of Mark and see what is there for us….because apparently our hope is in just that….in a spiritual eyesight that is able to see, envision, what God is up to…\\n\\tOur text from the Gospel of Mark draws us deeper into this vision metaphor:  what do we see right now; what can we not see yet, what are we reluctant to really see in our church, our families, the world around us?  As this story begins, Jesus and his disciples are on the way to Jerusalem, passing through the town of Jericho. Suddenly, a man sitting by the side of the road calls out to Jesus.  The man is said to be blind and he is a beggar.  Bottom of the pile economically, with no means taking care of himself other than asking for hand-outs.  But unlike many of the healing stories, he has a name and a lineage:  Bartimaeus, son of Timaus.  What future does he “see” for himself, we might wonder.  Where does he get his gumption, is what I want to know.  “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” now he is shouting.  Many people in Jesus’ group, and those who have gathered along the road, sternly rebuke the man.  “Pipe down already, you are making a scene.”  “Son of David,” bellows the man, “have mercy on me!”  “Son of David” is a Messianic title in Judaism;  Bartimaeus was linking Jesus to a long lineage, going back to Israel’s most famous King during the height of its prestige and power of the united monarchy in the 900’s before Christ.   The man without economic means, status or sight, “sees” something in Jesus that even his disciples have been missing: this is the Messiah, this is the one ushering in God’s reign of justice and compassion.  \\nIn the midst of difficult times, God wants our spiritual sight to be healed.  What a challenge:  to perceive and really hold on to God’s promises, to let these be a bedrock in our lives, and to move forward at the same time.  The novelist and theologian, Frederick Buechner describes this visualizing of God’s presence and promises in his book, Secrets in the Dark.  \\xa0\"By faith,” Buechner writes, “we understand, if we are to understand it at all, that the madness and lostness we see all around us and within us are not the last truth about the world but only the next to the last truth….Faith is the eye of the heart, and by faith we see deep down beneath the face of things – by faith we struggle against all odds to be able to see – that the world is God\\'s creation even so.\\xa0 It is (God) who made us and not we ourselves, made us out of God’s peace to live in peace, out of God’s light to dwell in light, out of God’s love to be above all things loved and loving.\\xa0That is the last truth about the world.\"  “Your faith has made you well, whole, renewed,” Jesus says to the Bartimeus.  The eyes of Bartimeus’ heart saw and recognized Jesus as the one ushering in God’s kingdom of justice and mercy.  The eyes of his heart knew that the “madness and lostness” all around him were not the last truth about the world.\\xa0\\nWe are in the middle of circumstances this weekend and in the next few days over which we do not have a lot of control.  We can buy bottled water, batteries and sandbags and pull boats out of the water, and the forces of nature will move as they will.   But whatever happens, these things will not be the “last truth.”  In the middle of all this, the Psalmist suggests we Look to God and be radiant.  Wow…our faces do get ashen when we are sad or worried.  Look to God and be radiant….what a powerful phrase to carry with us through the upcoming days.  We are made “out of God’s light to dwell in light,” wrote Buechener.   Be a light filled vision to those around you, helping them envision a future where God is working in all things for good.   Because we don’t know what the storm will bring, and we don’t know what your time with your future pastor will be like.   But we do know that our fears can bring on a certain spiritual blindness.  “What do you want from me,”  Jesus asks blind Bartimeus.  “Teacher, let me see again,” he says.  We too need to ask God over and over, “let me see again.”\\nFor two years we have been thinking, praying and discussing together about your unseen future, what God might be calling you to do as a congregation.   Like our Protestant ancestors during the Reformation, we have sought to be bold in maintaining the best of the past but always re-forming ourselves in light of  God’s emerging future.\\nAnd now, other pastors will work with you in that task.  First Pastor Rob for a spell, as the Pastoral Search Committee finishes it’s work and presents you with a candidate for the settled position.  Then, this yet unseen Pastor will come to help you discover your own gifts and talents, help equip you for different types of ministries here in this beautiful church and out into the wider community.  A blind man was able to “see” Jesus for who he was.  The Protestant Reformers called people to see the possibilities of God’s re-vitalizing and re-forming movement among them, in the middle of institutional corruption and individual disempowerment.   We too each move into God’s uncertain but good future. With radiant faces we hold onto this vision that “It is (God) who made us and not we ourselves, made us out of God’s light to dwell in light,… out of God’s love to be above all things loved and loving.\\xa0That is the last truth about the world.\"\\xa0 I will always treasure these brief two years together, this time when you faithfully, courageously have envisioned:  “What is God calling us to next?”  Let us each continue to look to God and be radiant, now and in the days to come.   Amen.\\n\\t \\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tAt the point he writes this letter, Paul is one of the early leaders of the small group of Jesus’ followers.  He travels all over the Mediterranean talking about the teachings and presence of Jesus, and forming small communities of the early church.  He started a group like that in the city of Corinth, where people of all different social classes, slaves and free people, rich and poor, would come together to talk, pray, sing, read scriptures and share a meal of bread and wine at the Lord’s Table together.  They would make sure everyone had enough, and that there was food and money left over for the poor.  But they were all so different.  They struggled with getting to know each other, hanging out together, listening to God’s direction together.  Paul writes in his a letter to them that he knows this is hard, because they are all so different.  But they need to keep working at it, because, they are in fact the Body of Christ on earth now.  Jesus the Christ is no longer walking around on earth, but his spirit is with them.  And….his Spirit dwells in each of them and all of them together.  To try and explain this amazing idea, Paul says:  You are the Body of Christ, and individually members of one another.  You are the hands and feet, eyes and ears, belly button and toes of Jesus Christ here on earth!  You are all connected.  You matter to each other.  No hierarchy.  Unlike the political state, implied Paul, you are all of equal importance to the whole.\\n\\n\\tLast December, I first started meeting with our Discovery Team.  Our Executive Board and I put this group together from all your suggestions; they were to lead us in the work of figuring out who is FHCUCC and what does God call you to next.  We pulled together a very mixed group of people: different ages, different experiences here in the church, each with different ideas about what happened with the previous two ministers.  Really different.  And they started meeting, and talking together and listening to one another and trying on this idea that they were all part of this Body here at Falcon Heights Church.  \\n\\n\\tEarly on, I asked them to do an exercise with me.  Think of this church, I said, imagine this church, as the living Body of Christ.  Imagine it as a body, a person.  What?  Yes, try it.  If this church were a body, a person, right now, what would it be like?  Well, they thought and imagined….and started to share.  Try it yourself.  What would you say?  What do you see when you think about this?  A man or a woman?  About how old would you say this body, this person, is?  What kind of shape is it in?  What is important to this person?  What does it value?  What challenges does it face?  Here’s a hard one….what part of the body are you?  What abilities and gifts are yours to share for the increased well-being of this body?\\n\\n\\tI love how the ancient writer Paul talks about how the parts of the body all belong together.  All of us play different parts in the body and are all connected to each other.  The hand can’t say to the foot: I don’t like you very much, you don’t belong here.  Paul says that when one part of the body suffers, all suffer.  I think of that when we share joys and concerns.  We are happy and we are sad, all of us, depending on what is happening to each individual member.\\n\\n\\tAs you now move from this Sanctuary Into small groups, you will be invited to explore what this Body of Christ, FHCUCC, might look like in the future if it were really thriving, really healthy and helping all of us change and grow in Christ.  What would be most important, most valued among you at that point?  What would relationships be like among all of you?  “Members one of another,” wrote Paul.  What would your connections with and impact on the wider community be like?  Picture being a truly vibrant and transformative church.  I invite you to imagine what that would look like.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Book of Esther is great rip of a story with its melodramatic plot and beautiful/courageous heroine.  We have an evil villain Haman, and a rather dunce-like and reactionary King.  There are numerous, struggling victims rescued from cruelty and torture in the nick of time.  Even though the word God is never mentioned in the story, down through Jewish and Christian history, this has become a beloved story of how oppressed people often surmount their difficulties.  It reminds us that through our own honesty and goodness, through God’s guidance and also in part because of the foolishness and poor choices of the world’s oppressors, the day can be saved.  Apparently, God can work through all kinds of misfortunes and mishaps.\\n\\nIn this story, evil is surmounted through the faithful piety and fidelity to her origins by the Jewish Queen Esther.  Trying to live in both the Persian world of her husband’s royal court and remain true to her Jewish faith and identity, Esther becomes transformed when she finally risks her life to choose between these two worlds.  She uncovers the prideful and violent plans of the courtier Haman who wants to execute her uncle Mordecai because he would not bow down before Haman.  Haman also plans to kill all the Jews in the kingdom.  In the dramatic dialogue we just heard, Esther wields her royal authority for a higher good.  She risks the wrath of her husband King, and she saves her people.    \\n\\nThrough Jewish history, this story of Queen Esther became a cherished reminder of how God can work through ordinary people called to face evil with extraordinary courage.  Celebrated each year in the Jewish community as the Festival of Purim, it became a legacy story.  It reminded Jews, who often had to live in two different worlds, of who and whose they really were.  This is part of what Biblical stories do: they remind us of who and whose we are.  They keep us connected to a larger story than the one isolated tale of our individual lives.  \\n\\nI have wondered lately if part of our problem as a nation divided into hostile political and social factions is that we sometimes get stuck in an isolated tale of our own individual group.  I hear stories of people claiming that their particular way of life is being destroyed by outsiders, and that multi-cultural communities are a threat to their own identity and well-being.  This also happens on an individual level.  Have you ever noticed in listening to someone talk, how they repeatedly tell an isolated identity-forming story that has really got them stuck?  Maybe you find yourself doing this.  I remember a time in my life when several personal losses seemed to pile on top of each other.  The loss of a beloved job as chaplain when the hospital where I worked downsized a third of its staff.  The shock and pain of several miscarriages.  Over time, the story of these losses became my main story.  Yes, it was important for me to grieve these losses, they were real and painful.  But after about a year or so, a friend dared to say to me:  “Anne, sometimes your grief story is the first story you tell about yourself…I hear it over and over.”  She told me this with great compassion, but it was still hard to hear.  Mostly because it was true.  The story of my losses had begun to define who I was, a quietly tragic victim of circumstances beyond my control.  In my prayers, I finally stopped asking God “why did these things happen, how could these losses have befallen me.”  I started asking God, “now what?  Where are you leading me now; I am your beloved child, not a victim; how would you have me express that reality in my life?”  A subtle, inner shift in my identity and began to make a world of difference in my life.  \\n\\nHow often our own successes and failures, our family connections and our particular geographical roots seem like the only story that matters and might even limit us.  This is why you and I need these Biblical stories, even the strange ones like Esther’s saga.  They remind us that we are part of a much larger narrative of humanity and God’s purposes.  They remind us of who and whose we are, as beloved, forgiven children of God.   You and I live in a world that divides us into ever smaller affinity groups.  Our different groups have distinctive political views, with specific radio, TV stations and internet sites that reinforce our particular point of view.   From the World War II generation down through the and new millennial generation, from people of wealth to the middle class to the working poor, we have broad differences in experience and perspective, that often divide us. The Biblical stories remind us that we a part of a much larger faith group that indeed encircles the globe.  We are followers of Jesus, Christians rooted in and growing up out of the Jewish tradition.  The Bible is filled with our identity stories.  \\n\\nBut the stories don’t just tell us who we have been or are in this moment.  Biblical stories remind me of who I am turning into, which I suppose is why they are often filled with such hope.  And each time I come to them something new is going to reveal itself to me. \\n\\nI find this particularly true in stories about the disciples of Jesus, who really struggled with understanding what Jesus was up to near the end of his ministry.  We can look down our noses and call them dense, but I know I would have winced, even recoiled, at some of Jesus’ teachings and interactions with people.  I like to think I would have been one of those women who followed him with such devotion, but wonder if I would have resisted understanding Jesus myself, given the chance.  All the talk about suffering and dying; I probably would have been in denial all the way to the cross, if I had been following Jesus back then.  Trying to get it right, but always drawing the circle a bit too small, not quite appreciating how wide and gracious and extravagant Jesus’ invitation to the outsider really was.   This is where the Biblical stories bring me hope about what I might become, about the places in my life that might yet be transformed.  \\n\\nIn today’s text from Mark, the disciples come to Jesus and complain that a certain fellow is casting out demons but not doing it in Jesus’ name.  I smile in recognition of some of my own pet complaints, especially about popular “spiritual leaders” who have no theological training nor affiliation with a wider faith community. I think about how we debate over the meaning of membership in churches, over what kind of activity or doctrinal assertion is needed for someone to be one of us.   And there is Jesus, always drawing the circle wider, pushing his followers to see true hospitality in a broader context.  Reminding them not to become a stumbling block for the new disciples, not to overwhelm them with expectations and committee assignments that become like millstones around their necks.  This is the Biblical story in its prophetic role.  It pushes and challenges us to change.  (p. 48)\\n\\nRepeated, daily encounters with the Biblical stories help me see how God accepts us as we are, but also that God does not want to let us stay that way. These stories help us get clear about who we are, and help us claim that identity as God’s beloved ones.  How much more comfortable, easier, it is to stay in one isolated story about who we are.  These stories call us up out of ourselves, into the new, wider perspectives and new choices God would have us make as faithful people.  Thanks be to God for our sacred scriptures.  They are our identity stories; both prophetic challenge and source of hope.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tEach year, as I preach my way through the church calendar, I find myself holding my breath starting about this time in November.  I’m not exactly bracing against winter’s impending blast or the oncoming rush of seasonal festivities.  It’s more that my mind “holds its breath” as I dodge through, what is for me, some problematic Biblical terrain.  Every year, before we get to the tender stories of Jesus’ birth, our Common Lectionary runs us through repeated references to the end times. I myself struggle with the Biblical references to a judgmental and violent God that are laced throughout parts of the Old and New Testaments.  I cringe at some of these ominous sayings about a wrathful sorting-out associated with Jesus’ return at the end of time.  I do not believe that Jesus presented an exclusive message that sorted people into an afterlife of heaven or hell.  I understand his teachings to focus on abundant life of the living, while we are all living.  But, what to make of these end-time stories that always pile up right before the Advent and Christmas season begins?  Shall we just make a more theologically comfortable detour towards Thanksgiving, with all that cozy spiritual gratitude talk, and then head straight for the Christmas carols?\\n\\n\\tAnd yet, each of the three synoptic gospels, as we call Mark, Luke and Matthew, conclude their accounts of the teaching and works of Jesus with unnerving references to the end of human history.   Each of these gospel writers collected and recorded Jesus’ stories about division, judgment and even violence in the final full manifestation of God’s realm on earth.  And each fall, we feel the tension mount in the Gospel stories, as Jesus has more and more run-ins with the religious authorities and his parables are increasingly challenging.  As we head towards the end of the church calendar year, Jesus final teachings allude to his return.  But the disciples don’t really have a clue he is headed for death, nor that following him is going to entail some difficult sacrifice of their own.  Jesus stories turn edgy, mysterious, even harsh.  He tosses over tables in the Temple, he challenges the religious leaders directly, he intimates that there may be some final separation of good from evil.   I can just hear his disciples murmuring among themselves, “hey guys, what is up with Jesus?”  \\n\\n\\tToday’s story from Matthew is in response to questions directed to Jesus about the end of human history.  Speculative stories about God’s final sorting-out were common during this time of Roman oppression, widening class disparity, and suffering of those on the margins.  Jesus responds with several parables indicating a final culmination of God’s powers of justice and some reminders about how one is to live in the meantime.  The Gospel writer Matthew, as he has done before, concludes with the dire warning that, if you don’t get with the program, you will be tossed into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.\\n\\nConsidering this text more closely, we hear Jesus, once again, going over the top to make a point.  Hyperbole and exaggeration seem to rule the day, as he tells a strange tale of a master leaving on a journey and giving his slaves some talents.  Jesus is not talking about talent like a specific ability or gift here: a talent for singing or for athletics.  A talent is a unit of money in Biblical times.  And Jesus’ audience would be incredulous at this point, even snickering: one talent was the equivalent of a huge bucket full of solid gold, weighing from 50-75 pounds, worth 15-20 years of work for a day laborer.  How on earth would they know how to invest this, much less pick it up? Here is our first hint about where Jesus is going:  As countless contemporary Biblical commentators have noted before me, this is another story about extravagance.  Extravagant welcome, extravagant generosity, extravagant forgiveness and reconciliation: all huge themes for Jesus.\\n\\nIn this curious story, the master is clearly generous, and responds glowingly to the news of the proceeds acquired by the first two slaves who made fortunate investments.  But for some reason, the last slave doubts the master’s extravagant generosity.  He impudently calls the master both harsh and unjust to his face.  Yet the servant’s bravado ends there, and he fearfully and passively keeps the money safely buried until the master’s return.  The master is livid and throws him out to the place of (can we say it together?) “outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.”  Oh, we get it, the crowds would be murmuring….don’t bury God’s extravagance!\\n\\nCollected as a whole, the parables of Jesus are actually quite a mixed bag of good news / bad news narratives.   Of course, we are drawn to the stories of unexpected reconciliation and grace.  All is forgiven, the lost are found, everyone is welcomed home.  But he told many stories where the natural consequences of bad behavior catch up with people.  The Gospel writer Matthew does not shy away from including stories that end on a perplexingly negative note. In God’s realm, Jesus suggests, there is both grace and judgment.  But what are we to make of this?  \\n\\n\\tJames Howell, a United Methodist minister from North Carolina, writes in the Christian Century magazine about this story.  He suggests that we can get distracted if we think of a “talent” as an individual gift or special ability.  Because one talent was such an absurdly huge amount of money, he suggests that we think of the “talent” as a metaphor for the larger gift of the gospel message.  Since this is Matthew, writing to his own church community, think of it as an “astonishingly ravishingly gift (that) has been unloaded upon an unsuspecting church that has not the faintest notion how to handle it” writes Howell.  Reading this, I thought of how we in the church sometimes “bury” the treasure of the gospel.  In most mainline Protestant churches, we have asked people to join us and become affiliated with an institution, the church, and all its good works.  But so often the message we bury is that God wants us to not just join another group.  God yearns for us to connect with this divine love that both loves and mercifully judges us.  Judges not to punish us, not to send us to hell, but to transform us.  To slowly help us take on the mind and heart of the Risen Christ. \\n\\t\\n\\tFor so many of us who might have been fairly successful in our lives, the radical notion of being saved from our sins, our lives turned around and changed, our very being transformed, sounds all a bit…well, weird.  Possibly distasteful, even unnecessary.  Overly Christian in a pietistic way?  Evangelical seeming? Emotional?  Embarrassing?  Do we dare say to a friend: “Come to church so you can change!”  We would rather invite people to church so they can enjoy the music, or the inspiring preaching or the quality children’s programs or work on service projects with us.  Yes, all of these are important and honorable, but the Gospel message is about transformation and change of persons and society.  Those who study church growth and vitality are telling us that newcomers come to church these days not necessarily to get connected with another affiliative institution.  They come because they want to be changed by the power of the living God.  This poses an interesting problem for many churches as they reconsider the meaning of membership in the congregation and how the church helps people be transformed in their lives.   \\n\\n\\tIn considering Matthew’s parable, James Howell goes on to write that “it might be that the parable solicits from us not the offering up of our individual abilities, but rather the frank, embarrassing admission of our corporate inability (as churches)?  We populate church committees with the best people for the task at hand, and in meetings they confidently offer insights from their education and professional experience.  But (Howell continues) maybe what God needs is people who will huddle up, shake their heads and confess, ‘we just have no idea; the treasure is too big, too heavy.’ “ Maybe at this point God’s perspective can move among our best human ideas.  “Maybe then,” Howell continues, “we can dare something for God.  God gives the gospel not to me so my ability can be put to good use, but to us so our inability might be exposed and God thereby gloried.” (James C. Howell, The Christian Century Magazine, “Trojan Horse: Matthew 15:14-30, November 1, 2005.) \\n\\n\\tGod gives us the gospel here at Falcon Heights so our “inability might be exposed?”  These are unsettling words, but perhaps they might serve as an encouragement during this time of transition between pastors.  We really don’t know what is going to happen next around here, do we?  How might God be glorified in our “inability” to see our way forward right now?  Especially for a church that has, both a proud history and difficult conflict throughout its 75 years? \\n\\n\\tWhat might it mean for us here at Falcon Heights to be, as Howell suggests, “clueless” as to what to do next, at least for a while?  To be “dumbfounded” and even “overwhelmed,” “to be under no illusion that (we) have ever known quite what to do because of Jesus.”   What would it look like just start digging up this “buried treasure” of the Gospel, with all its quirky radicalness and call to personal transformation and society re-formation?  The gift of the gospel message is astounding and overwhelming; as Christians we claim humans can be transformed and that we can work together to heal the world.  During this interim period, it will be unnerving but important to acknowledge our inability, our overwhelm in facing the needs of this 21st century as a church. But all God asks is that we stay awake and unburied, attentive and available.  The treasure is extravagantly huge that God gives us.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. ',\n",
       " 'I remember the last day of my final interim minister’s training program almost a decade ago, when our instructor looked out over the room full of ministers and said:  “You know, I think all parish ministry is interim ministry!”  What?  He went on to explain that churches have to realize that they are always in an interim time of transition!  The world around us is constantly changing, the spiritual needs of people continually evolve, social justice needs change….the world does not stand still.  You will call a new minister and think your interim time of transition is over.  Well, apparently not.  My interim training instructor concluded by saying he found this reality to be powerful and quite exciting.  Life is all about endings and beginnings, birth and death, change and transformation.  What would it be like to truly embrace this transitional life?  \\t\\nThere may be some clues for us in our scripture texts for today.  Both Isaiah and Jesus’ teaching in Matthew seem to encourage us to have a different relationship with the past.  But, neither good nor bad memories are not something you can will away easily, unless you have a get dementia or a lobotomy. Could there be a connection between a different relationship with our past and our being better able to perceive and embrace God’s “new thing?”  The key, for Jesus, appears to be in the practice of forgiveness.  That’s how we change our relationship with the past.  Today’s scripture passage from Matthew sets forgiveness within the wider challenge of loving others.  Jesus tells a parable that punches through any idealized notion we might have of love being polite niceties and sweet harmony.  Apparently, according to Jesus, our love needs to be a forgiving love.  But in today’s reading, the disciple Peter wants to know how often we have to forgive someone who has offended or hurt us.  Probably thinking he sounds generous, Peter ups the prevailing rabbinical requirement of forgive-three-times and suggests:  “should we forgive someone up to 7 times?”  Jesus shocks the whole group with “Not seven times, but, I tell you, 77 times.”  Or as the oldest NT texts translate: 70 TIMES 7 = 490 TIMES.   \\nNow, let’s get realistic here. Our personal forgiveness of someone who uses violence does necessarily not stop the violence.  No one would have thought that “forgiving Hitler” would stop WW II or the Holocaust.  And it probably won’t stop the extreme terrorist tactics of ISIS.  Individuals, groups, nations that perpetrate violence against innocent people should be brought to justice.  Period.  But if forgiveness doesn’t stop awful things from happening, what is the point?  After giving this absurdly high number, Jesus relates a rather dire story of a harsh king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.  After much pleading, one heavily in-debt slave is finally forgiven his debt (the equivalent of about $25 million) by the relenting king.  But then this slave has the audacity to turn around and imprison a fellow slave who owes him a small amount of money (the equivalent of about $50).  His fellow slaves are understandably distressed by this double-standard and inform the king.  Infuriated, the king orders the slave tortured until he presents the money he is concealing and repays his entire debt.  The story ends rather ominously with Jesus suggesting that God will do this to us if we do not forgive our brothers and sisters from our hearts.  Yikes!  Clearly, Jesus uses exaggeration to send his point home.  But what are we to make of this?\\n\\nIt’s no surprise that contemporary researchers have found that holding onto grudges, resentments and hurts actually stresses people out so much that it disrupts their lives in many ways.  Many of us have experienced the hold that unforgiveness can have on us.  We hang onto a “grievance story,” this “former thing” from the past.  We remember the offense done to us so that we can re-tell it to ourselves, and anyone who will listen.  Perhaps we hope the re-telling will protect us in the future, or warn others, or give us some sense of control in unsettling times of transition.  We may tell this story so many times it starts to take up a lot of space in our brain.  New experiences and challenges are constantly filtered through that grievance story, subtly distorting our perceptions and perspective on life.  Nations can carry grievance stories, and we see the consequences unfolding around the world today. As Americans we are not immune to national grievance stories: since the events of 9/11, and now our impending war against ISIS, any Muslim, all of Islam or even Middle-Eastern looking people, have become suspect.  Towns and cities fight the building of mosques or Islamic community centers.   Islam is seen as an evil religion.\\tWe can even carry a grievance story about our own mistakes and failures, and be unable to forgive ourselves.\\nJesus knew that something damaging happens when we are unable to let go of our grievance stories.  We seem to block the channel within us where both new information and empathy flow in and out.   Jesus also recognized that if I have had a falling out with my fellow human, and have not cleaned it up, I am going to have trouble connecting with God.  Not because God rejects me, but I’m not in much of a receiving mode. I am much less likely to perceive God’s “new thing” because I rent out a lot of space in my mind to my old grievance story. My ability to perceive and embrace God’s future is limited. \\nForgiveness does not necessarily rebuild trust or relationships.  It is only the first step, the step we have the opportunity to take, clearing space in our brains and healing ourselves. Forgiveness is for ourselves, so we may be transformed.   Forgiveness helps us let go of that old grievance story, the “former things” as Isaiah would say, we are compelled to tell….and retell.  It helps us recover our energies and enables us to focus on the stories that really matter…the emerging stories of God’s good future coming towards us.  \\nI will not be part of your life together as God’s future comes towards you here at Emmaus.  My contract specifically stated that I would under no circumstance be a candidate for the called minister position.  We were not to “court” one another.  We were free to do honest self-reflection about who you have been as a church.  And now you are opening, with curiosity and excitement, to the “new thing” that God intends for you.  You are learning about the many paths that have brought each of you here, you are exploring how you will continue to travel together, living into and becoming the church of your name: a ccongregation that is united in the one who meets you on the road you travel together: the Spirit of the Living Christ.  I will truly miss being part of your future journey as a congregation!\\n\\tI will always treasure these 22 months together, when we faithfully, courageously asked the perennial, transitional questions together:  “What is God’s new thing?  What is God calling us to next?”  Blessings and peace, dear Emmaus United Church of Christ.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tI suggest we start with this question that was addressed to the disciple Peter by Jesus:  “do you love me?” Have you ever been asked this question:  “Do you love Jesus?” There are a number of Christian communities where members greet each other regularly with personal questions about one’s relationship with Jesus: “how is your walk with Jesus going these days?”   Maybe you have experienced questions such as these as a litmus test, a way of ferreting out if you were really saved.  Do you love Jesus?  Does the question make us feel  uncomfortable, our personal space a bit invaded, leaving our mind a tad befuddled?  Ask yourself, “Do I love Jesus?”  Notice the thoughts and feelings that come up for you as we move into the stories.\\nTurning first to the Acts piece about Saul of Tarsus.  He will later be identified by his Roman name, Paul, and become a major spokesperson for the early church.  But Saul, a learned Jew and son of a Roman citizen, never met the historical Jesus.  In the years following Jesus’ death and reports of his resurrection, Saul grew to mistrust and even hate Jesus’ increasingly bold followers. Saul had joined forces with those teachers of the Law who believe that the followers of Jesus were misguided and were a liability for the whole Jewish community.   Especially considering the Jewish community’s tenuous relationship with the oppressive Roman authorities.\\nOne day, Saul is on the road to Damascus, heading off to interrogate and harass some more followers of Jesus Christ.  Saul is suddenly overwhelmed by  brilliant light and a voice: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”  His traveling companions can hear it too:  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting!”  Saul falls off his horse and is blinded by the encounter.  The voice tells them to go to Damascus and await further instructions.    There Saul is healed by one of the Jesus’ disciples, is baptized and begins to proclaim the Risen Jesus in the synagogues.  An astonishing turn-around, a drastic change of heart.  We might wonder: What converts such mistrust into affirmation?  What changes the actions of hate into love?\\n\\tPerhaps there has been a time when this has happened in your own life.  A time when clinging to old perceptions and feelings, problematic and settled ways of seeing and doing things, just did not work anymore?  Yesterday I was reading stories about the short but impactful lay ministry of a young woman named Rachel Held Evans.  Columnist, best selling author and popular speaker, she courageously called out homophobia, judgemental Biblical literalism and misogyny in the church.  She was invited by President Obama to serve on a White House\\xa0council\\xa0for faith-based and neighborhood partnerships.  All because she had experienced her own “thrown to the ground” moment. Her conservative church’s participation in a statewide campaign to ban same-sex marriage led her to change her views on homosexuality and transgender issues. She went on to challenge both conservative and progressive evangelicals to a change of heart. As a straight woman, married with young children, she became an unusual ally for the LGBTQ+ community and fighting misogyny in evangelical circles.  Eventually drawn to the richness of the liturgy and social justice focus, she joined an Episcopal church. With tremendous appeal to a wide audience of younger spiritual seekers, she continued to publish, blog and speak about her love for church, Jesus and the Bible. \\nThe softening of a heart can happen slowly over time; or we get radically confronted, throw to the ground like Saul, “carved-out” by some event: by a disappointment, a failure, a loss….for Rachel Held Evans it was her church working against the marriage equality act and the exclusion of women’s leadership in her evangelical circles.  What might it be for each of us?  What old certitudes, ingrained habits, no longer serve your well-being? \\nWhen we find Peter with a group of the other disciples by the Sea of Tiberias in today’s passage from John, its hard to see that their hearts have changed in any significant way.  I can just imagine Peter turning dejectedly to his companions: “Jesus is gone.  So much for us being ‘fishers of men and women.’  I’m going back to fishing for fish.”  They put out their boat and labor all night.  But no fish.  \\nThese men, among others, have already encountered the Risen Jesus, talked with him, had the Holy Spirit breathed on them, been commissioned to go out and forgive in Jesus name.   But here, they don’t even recognize the stranger who calls out from the beach, saying: “hey, let your nets down on the other side of your boat.”  They start to strain against the huge load of fish in their nets.  Abundance, overwhelming fish abundance, slithering out onto the deck.  “I have come that you might have abundant life,” Jesus used to tell them. And suddenly a switch flips in Peter; it’s like a light goes on, he’s thrown to the bottom of his assumptions that it is all over and he shouts, “It is the Lord!”  He flings himself into the water, thrashing towards Jesus on the shore.  \\nBefuddled, the rest of the disciples do not understand until they actually have eaten breakfast together with this stranger on the beach.  Each of the disciples have been “thrown down” from their assumptions that this “inclusive, merciful, abundant, present Kingdom of God” Jesus taught was all over.  “Well, we figured we would just go back to fishing for fish,” they try to explain.  Jesus gazes at them with such tenderness, such compassion.  And then, the question: “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks.   \\n“What?  Why, yes, Lord; you know that I love you,” Peter answers, perhaps remembering the first time he denied even knowing Jesus during those terrifying hours following Jesus’ arrest.  “Ah…well then feed my lambs,” says Jesus.   “Feed your lambs…?” Peter scratches his head.  “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks again.  “Well, yeah, you know I love you!”  Peter mumbles, remembering how he lied to that woman in the Temple courtyard that awful day.  \\n“Tend my sheep,” replies Jesus.   All the disciples are staring at the two of them; what is going on here?   But now Jesus is asking Peter again;  “Do you love me?”  And the light of comprehension starts dawning even brighter.   Peter finally sinks deep into the reality of his own forgiven self.  It’s as though Jesus is saying: “I am seeing you Peter, for all that you have been and all that you are. Can you open to that”  Peter, do you love me?”  \\nAnd it all comes crashing in for Peter.  “Lord, you know everything;” he cries.  “You know how I abandoned not only you, but how I abandoned that best self I came to be as your disciple.  You know it all, and you still want me to go out in your name and fish for people and forgive and tend and feed all those who hunger for you.  You know that I love you.”  \\n\\tMaybe this is what a change of heart, conversion, really looks like.  It isn’t suddenly having an intellectual certainty about a creed or belief or theological concept.  For whatever reason, in that dawning awareness, there is an opening of our hearts to seeing ourselves and reality differently.  In her latest and what would be her final book,\\xa0,  Rachel Held Evans wrote this about Christian community: “Church is not a building, or a denomination, or a nonprofit organization. Church is a moment in time when the kingdom of God draws near, when a meal, a story, a song, an apology, and even a failure is made holy by the presence of Jesus among us and within us.”\\xa0 Having just keynoted at the “Why Christian?” conference in San Francisco several weeks ago, Rachel Held Evans became ill and was hospitalized.  She had adverse reactions to medication and died yesterday morning.   Who knows how much time we each have for a change of heart? \\nAffirming our love for Jesus will always send us out, like it did Saul and Peter and, centuries later, Rachel Held Evans.   “Follow me,” Jesus says at the end of the beach encounter.  We are invited to follow him. Not just as dead hero and teacher, but as a living presence leading us deeper into God’s hurting world. To forgive and to feed and to tend.   I thank God for that.  Amen. (Time of Silent Reflection)',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIn a few moments we will hear a musical telling of the story of David and Goliath.  This story is now 3000 years old and has captured the imaginations of Jews. Christians and Muslims down through the ages.  It’s a story about the early nation of Israel as it moves from being a bunch of nomadic tribes moving around with their flocks, to a settled group of people with farms, towns, cities and a more organized way of being together.  These are people trying to listen to God and allow God’s guiding principles of justice, mercy and peace to rule their lives.  But this isn’t always easy.  \\n\\n\\tToday’s musical focuses on a dramatic point in early Israel’s history, out on a dusty battlefield, where a young boy faces a huge, fierce Philistine warrior  (Outlined in 58 verses in I Samuel 17).  Yes, there are some gory parts to this tale!  But the storyteller wants us to understand how God is able to use all sorts of people, even young, seemingly unskilled and weak people, to carry out God’s purpose in the world.  God can use any of us for God’s work of justice and hope.  The narrator also wants us to know that God is always on the side of the underdog, the marginalized, and the oppressed people.  And this is exactly what Jesus will talk about, 1000 years later.  But how does young David get here?  And what are the Philistine’s doing harassing the Israelites?  \\n\\n\\tWe have to back up a bit.  In the middle of the 11th century BCE, the loose community of Israelite tribes was ruled by men, and a few unusual women like Deborah, who were appointed as judges.  The judges would help people resolve their arguments and live together peacefully following God’s commandments.  The community also included honored visionaries, who would pay special attention to God and who has the ability to understand what God was directing the people to do in their lives.  Samuel was one of the judges and also a visionary, a prophet.  \\n\\n\\tThe Israelites are becoming more prosperous and established.  They needed political unity and a way to defend themselves.  More and more other people wanted to invade their territory.   The Israelites were now surrounded by the aggressive Philistines.  Representatives of the tribes of Israel came to Samuel and say “give us a king” to help lead us better.  Samuel wasn’t sure this is a good idea, but he reluctantly anointed Saul, a great warrior, to be the first King.  The King was to be the one who will speak and act for God and who would readily receive ruling instructions through the prophets.  But Saul stops paying attention to the prophet Samuel, gets greedy and doesn’t follow the important religious rituals of the day.  Both God and Samuel become sorry they appointed Saul to be King.  Here’s what happens next:  (Read from I Samuel 16:14-17) “Now the spirit of the Lord….”  This is why King Saul has night headaches and bad dreams. This is how young David comes into the court and gets King Saul’s attention.\\n\\n\\tFast forward now to the Philistines.  Who are these people?\\nPhilistines were “Sea Peoples” who migrated from the Aegean Sea region 2000 years before David’s time.  They are working for the Pharaoh in Egypt, hired as mercenaries to recapture land for Egypt and they were a huge menace to Israelite towns and fields, forcing tribes to give up their lands.  Philistines were well organized, had superior weapons and unaggressive military policy.  Goliath of Gath is a Philistine warrior, and was huge, invincible, and mean.  He would taunt the smaller and less properly attired Israelites with challenges to do battle.\\n\\n\\t(Read I Samuel 17 1-11, introducing Goliath.)  In these days, you had to supply your own soldier with food.  Since the shepherd boy David was too young to fight, he brings food to his brothers on the battlefield.  David is outraged by Goliath’s taunts and volunteers to do battle with the giant.  He is Inexperienced, has inadequate equipment, but it is clear that God will guide him. \\n\\n\\t King Saul will eventually recognize David as a true leader when he kills Goliath, but Saul will finally turn jealous of David’s success and popularity among the people.  Saul will plot David’s death, but David will manage to elude capture.  Following Saul’s death, David will be chosen King and will bring Israel into a time of prosperity and peace. \\n\\n\\tDavid’s story is not just one about courage.  It is about God’s ability to work through us, whatever our meager gifts or tentative talents.  It’s a story about God’s constant support for the marginalized and the oppressed.  Amen.\\n\\n(Historical details from Great People of the Bible and How They Lived edited by G. Ernest Wright and Basic Bible Commentary: First and Second Samuel by Frank Johnson.)',\n",
       " '\\tTwo scripture readings today, both from the New Testament.  Biblical texts which describe the early followers of Jesus in curiously different ways.  In one, from the Gospel of John, the disciples of Jesus have retreated into hiding right after his death.  The rest of his followers have apparently melted away into the shadows of Jerusalem, fearing reprisals by the Roman authorities.  In the passage from the Book of Acts, set a few months later, chapter 4 describes several disciples bolding teaching in public in the large metropolis, and “proclaiming that in Jesus there is resurrection from the dead.”  Over the days that follow, thousands are said to join their movement, becoming known as People of the Way.  They live in communities of radical welcome where rich and poor, slave and free, male and female, are mutually embraced and where they hold everything that they own in common.  That’s a pretty big jump, from hiding in fear, to publicly proclaiming Jesus’ message of loving community and generosity!  \\n\\n\\tFor some people, the debate about Easter centers on the whether or not Jesus was actually physically resurrected.  But for me, I’m more intrigued by these followers of Jesus: what in the world happened to those terrified, guilt-ridden disciples?  How did they move from their deep sadness about his death and shame about betraying their beloved teacher, not to mention their own fear about arrest by the Romans?  This is what I want to know about, because in my own life and ministry I am deeply interested about how people can change.  How can I change my own attitudes and habits that just don’t serve God’s intentions for my life?  How can communities change their cultures of negative interactions, become more respectful, and support of a common vision of radical welcome and generosity?  When it comes to being a 21st century follower of the Way of Jesus, I want to know about the change stuff…..about how we become transformed into being agents of God’s love, instruments of peace and justice.   \\n\\n\\tThe Gospel of John passage returns us to the night after the morning that several of Jesus’ women followers discovered the empty tomb.  It’s Easter night.  Jesus had just been publically humiliated and executed as a troublesome teacher and prophet. The Jewish leaders were understandably trying to maintain a fragile peace with the occupying Roman legions, especially during this festival time of Passover when the population of Jerusalem would swell with pilgrims coming to the great Temple.  Jesus’ magnetic presence and compelling teachings had already gathered crowds elsewhere and created public disturbances. His proclamations on equality and compassion, just distribution of wealth and his acts of civil disobedience were troubling to those in power.  The religious leaders decided Jesus needed to be stopped for the good of the whole and dragged him before the Roman executioners.  Following the harrowing torture and crucifixion scene, Jesus’ disciples were terrified that the authorities would come after them too, as they had been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.\\n\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what is going on in the disciples’ minds as they huddle together in this darkened room.  Are they planning to slip out of Jerusalem and return to their fishing businesses and family life? But those troublesome women disciples have not been hiding. They went to Jesus’ tomb early that morning, and now they keep insisting Jesus is alive. \\n\\n\\tAll of a sudden, in the midst of anxious conversation behind locked doors, Jesus appears in front of them.   “Peace be with you,” he announces.  It is hard for us to imagine what it would feel like to see your murdered teacher and leader standing before you.  Actually, the disciples don’t recognize him at first.  He’s not a ghost, but not quite recognizably human either.  As post-Enlightenment people, strong on physical evidence and verification, this kind of stuff makes us antsy.  The thought of encountering anything related to the “spirit” world immediately kicks up visions of hauntings, zombies or New Age flakiness.  In response to the confusion and fear on the disciples’ faces, Jesus says to the group: “peace be with you.”  He then shows them his crucifixion wounds on his hands and side.  I’ll bet these disciples were hoping to never run into Jesus again, given their complicity in his death.  It wasn’t just Judas who betrayed Jesus.   Jesus’ close friend Peter denied knowing him 3x and most of the rest of them ran and hid after Jesus was arrested.  What might they expect Jesus to say now?  “Thanks a lot, you guys.  Way to be there for your friend.”   But no, Jesus says simply “peace be with you.”  No condemnation here.  Only affirmation and blessing.  The odd thing is that Jesus appears to trust that these frightened, cowardly people will become messengers of transformation themselves.  He immediately commissions them: “As God sent me, so I send you.”  No cozy hanging around in a privatized spiritual world with sweet Jesus, enjoying the peaceful vibes.  Jesus breathes on them saying, “receive the Holy Spirit.”  You are not in this alone.  He charges them:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”   Get up, you all, Jesus tells them.  You are blessed, you are forgiven, I need you to go out into the world and do some healing forgiveness work in my name!\\n\\n\\tAnd it all starts with: “peace be with you.”  I am reminded of how we are invited to “pass the peace” in worship each Sunday. The words sometimes seem awkward and It’s easy to lapse into a “hi, how are you?’” kind of salutation during this time.  Folks end up chatting about church business or baseball scores or after-worship lunch plans.  I invite us to reconsider these words of Jesus: “peace be with you.”  What are we trying to accomplish in those moments of greeting?  Or, what might we be extending to one another if we were to look each other directly in the eye and say these words: “peace be with you” - ?   \\n\\tTo extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of Christ, is no casual thing.  This is not just “being friendly.”  “Peace be with you” one person says; and “and also with you” the receiver may respond.  There is an old-fashion formality to it.  I don’t mean to suggest we should greet each other on Sundays with only these four words.   But these words themselves are a gift we give each other.   What am I hoping for, when I extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of God, to another person?  It may be a simple way of saying: there you are, I welcome you into this radically embracing community, and I trust your good intentions. Jesus challenged his disciples to forgive others and their sins would be forgiven; he warned them that if they held onto the sins of any, with resentment and bitterness, they would be retained. Relationships would stay broken.  Could there be some connection here between extending peace and acknowledging forgiveness?   How might we live into this challenge more fully as individuals and as a congregation?\\n\\n\\tThe Book of Acts describes that the early followers of the Risen Jesus were known for their being of “one heart and soul.”  Their’s was an unusually  close community that broke down all kind of social and class barriers.  They were known for their sharing everything.  “Everything they owned was held in common” and “there was not a needy person among them.”  The early Christian communities quickly gained a reputation for some fairly radical lifestyle choices in the Middle Eastern world of first century Roman occupation. (Dan Clendenin, a contemporary Biblical scholar, writes on his web-blog “Journey with Jesus” that) The characteristics of loving community and incredible generosity appear to account for the huge number of converts in 1st century Jerusalem.  People wanted to join this “emergent Jesus-community” because it was so different from the rest of their culture that valued military might, the acquisition of wealth and prestige.   \\n\\n\\tIt occurs to me that this is the standard for Christian community to which every church is held:  Are we different from the rest of our predominant culture that values individual freedom, competition, power and material goods above all else?   “Peace be with you,” we say to one another.  Perhaps that is where we start.  It’s an invitation to transformation we extend to each other during worship.  Because don’t really know, on any given Sunday, what a person brings with them to worship.  We don’t really know the full extent of the worries or fears, the sadness or anxiety that lie on the hearts of our fellow worshippers.  Each of us, at one time or another, comes to worship “locked” in something, just like the disciples who were locked behind closed doors.   “Peace be with you,” we say to stranger and close friend alike.  “A Community and generosity is here for you, as it is for me,” we signal one another.  \\n\\n\\tWe gather in communal worship because we want a transformative experience of the living God, among other people.  What a gracious and hopeful thing to say to one another in our worship time:  “peace be with you.”  Simple words, but they are Jesus’ words.  “Peace be with you” Jesus repeated a second time to the startled disciples.  “As God has sent me, so I send you.”  Apparently this is how change starts to happen.  God’s transformative peace is offered to us; and so we are sent.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:  \\n\\tThe “generosity and community” reference describing the early Christian community, as reported in the Book of Acts, comes from Dan McClendenin (Journey with Jesus website).\\n\\tThe writings of Rowan Williams, former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, have influenced my understanding of the disciples’ reactions to Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances (Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel).  \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tMany years ago, I was walking to a church meeting in downtown San Francisco.  I was in my late 20’s, a newly ordained minister, serving as an Associate Pastor in a suburban church south of the city.  I was headed to a meeting in the Northern California Conference offices of the United Church of Christ.   After parking my car in a city lot, I wended my way through a run-down part of the city called “south of Market Street.”  There were lots of street people panhandling, numerous unsavory-seeming characters hanging out on front stoops, but I don’t remember feeling too fazed.  Until…until I walked by a weather-beaten and disheveled man who was lying in an alleyway. He looked inebriated…or comotose…or even dead.  I felt worried and uncertain.  I paused, confused and embarrassed;  should I try to help him?  I might look stupid if I reach down to help him and he refuses, or he might strike out at me.  What to do?  Befuddled, I looked away and kept on walking.  I attended my meeting.  On my way back to the parking lot, several hours later, I glanced into the alley to see if the man was still there.  He was gone.  I will never know if he was helped by someone, if he was in the city morgue, or if he got up and walked away under his own steam.  The vision of him lying on the ground haunts me to this day.  \\n\\tPerhaps you remember a person who needed your help at some point. Maybe you can recall how, for some reason or another, you looked away….you didn’t reach out.  Perhaps like many American Christians, you read the newspaper or email feeds, and listen to the radio and watch the television news and have the same conversation with yourself.  “Oh gracious, look at this story, look at those awful photos, look at those people….how can the world have so many tragic things happening? What can I do about this?” you ask yourself.  We might find ourselves wondering how much of all this we really are responsible for, but most often there it ends.  Something distracts us, or we just turn away feeling confused and powerless, sad, even despairing.  At times like this, I am left wondering what God really might want me to do.\\nToday’s texts invite us to consider the responsibility we feel, or do not feel, towards fellow human beings.  In our scripture passage from Luke, a lawyer, an expert in the Jewish law, approaches Jesus and asks:  “What must I do to inherit eternal life?”    One’s religious “inheritance” was common language in Hebrew scriptures and referred to the blessings of being part of God’s covenant, living in God’s Kingdom.  For 1st century Jews living under the heel of Roman occupation and harassment, this whole “inheritance” of living God’s Kingdom seems to have vanished. The man’s question is not about the afterlife; it’s about how this Kingdom might be made real on earth and how he himself could be a part of it, in the middle of what seemed like Jewish disinheritance.  Jesus replies as any good Jew would, reminding his questioner that the essence of the Law is love; love of God and love of neighbor.   \\nIt is precisely a lack of love of God and neighbor that the Jewish prophet Amos was criticizing, some 900 years before this encounter.  Speaking truth to the powerful northern Kingdom of Israel, Amos sharply condemns the materialism and corruption of the reigning house of Jeroboam.  Court officials are corrupt and unjust.  The wealthy luxuriate while the poor wither and God notices.  Amos has a vision of God “measuring” Israel’s leaders with a plumb line, and basically finding them out-of-wack.  Seriously lacking in justice and compassion.  There will be consequences, says Amos, and sure enough the Assyrians soon overrun the weakened regime.\\nThe Jewish scholar questioning Jesus many years later would know these writings in Amos.   He would already know that love and compassionate action towards those in need was the bottom line in the Jewish Torah.  But he pushes further:  “But Jesus, just who is my neighbor?”  And this question strikes at the core of all of our good intentions as helpful people:  Who exactly is my neighbor?  Who are we supposed to be helping? What are the limits of our duty to those in need?  When have we done enough, as individuals, as a church, as a nation?   \\n\\tIt’s at this point that Jesus tells the story of a man traveling alone down the steep path between high cliffs, on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho.  Rugged, bleak terrain and a dangerous route, known for thieves who would hide in the caves in the cliffs.   Traveler were often beaten, robbed and left for dead.  A Temple priest and then a Levite, a lay associate who helped in the Jerusalem Temple, both hurry by and ignore the man in distress.  But Jesus has complicated the story.  These are not necessarily heartless, pompous religious leaders.  If either of them had stopped, and actually touched what may have been a corpse, they would then be ritually impure and unable to fulfill their obligations of leadership in the Temple.  Given their duties, the these two men are portrayed as prudent, carefully responsible to their leadership roles.  Hmmm….not unlike a young pastor hurrying to her meeting in San Francisco!   \\nJesus would now have everyone’s attention. In story-teller tradition, characters or actions are often presented in groups of three. The third piece carries the change-up, the twist in the story that will catch the hearers off-guard. Jesus concludes the story by saying that it is a third person, a Samaritan, who finally stops, attends to and carries the wounded traveler to help.   But here’s the puzzle: a Samaritan would be the least likely person to help a Jew. Jews and Samaritan’s at this time were about as friendly as Irish Catholics and Protestants have been in the recent past, or Palestinians and Iraelis today.   Samaritans were descendents of the people left by Assyria after it had invaded and exiled the northern kingdom of Israel.  The Samaritans were observers of the Torah and Jewish feast and holy days, spoke the same language and worshipped the same God as the Jews, but they had intermarried with foreigners.  Samaritans were therefore considered unclean, ritually impure.  The “unwanted, rejected” person in the story, the Samaritan, “shows mercy to his enemy,” a Jew (Hawkins).  \\n\\tFor this Samaritan, there was no real distinction between clean and unclean, between Samaritan and Jew.  Perhaps Jesus is reminding his listeners that there is an essential unity to all life, and there just isn’t a line between “your well-being and my well-being.”  (Bruce Epperly, Lancaster Seminary, Process and Faith website, 7.15.07).   I think about how the well-being of our nation may be connected to how we welcome needy strangers into our collective midst.  Our nation has a long and ugly history of rejecting certain immigrants.  Our rejection of Jewish refugees trying to flee Nazi terror caused countless unnecessary deaths.  A recent editorial in the New York Times noted we vascilate between “folly and cruelty on immigration.”  (7.7.19, p.9 , Ross Douthat, “Week in Review”).  Current legislative proposals swing from wildly impractical to stunningly inhumane.  And now, talk of sending people to a safe, third country?  The current suggestion is Guatemala, where deep “poverty, entrenched political corruption, urban crime,” is rampant (NYTimes, 714.19).  How do we better frame this debate?  According to Jesus, refugees’ well-being and our well-being is interconnected.  The prophet Amos described God as being outraged by the injustice of the northern kingdom of Israel some 3000 years ago.  Might God be offended by our current care of migrant children at the southern border and our splitting up of desperate families?  \\nAfter completing the parable, Jesus asks the lawyer, “which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” (vs. 36).  The legal scholar can’t even say the word Samaritan, and he simply replies  “the one who showed him mercy.” (vs. 37).  “Go and do likewise,” replies Jesus.   \\nHow might we each “go and do likewise” this week?  Who needs our help as a congregation?  How might we be better informed about those who are in need at our borders?  How do we become advocates for more compassionate and just immigration policies as a Just Peace church?  Stay alert, pay attention, says Jesus; look for the unlikely places where we are called to compassion.  Amen.  \\n\\t ',\n",
       " 'Being Receivers, Givers and then Receivers\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tWhen we are very young, life is almost entirely about receiving.  To survive, we must receive food and shelter; to begin to thrive we need cuddling and encouragement, consistent love and consistent discipline.  We just soak it in.  We receive naturally.  People usually respond well to our smiles, to our learning how to use a spoon and the bathroom, not biting our sister, so we start to give…a little.  But when we are young, it is about receiving, and Christmas mostly seems that way.  It’s about receiving presents.  Our Christmas lists are not usually what we will give other people.  Yes, yes, there is something else about a Baby Jesus born in a chilly manger with stinky animals long ago.  But the big deal is waiting for and then receiving PRESENTS!\\n\\n\\tThen we get a bit older, and we might learn to make something in school for a parent, a beloved guardian.  Slowly, we learn the both the joy and hassle of trying to find a perfect gift with whatever money and time we have.  We get older and realize this is the Big Deal for most of our culture:  it’s on the TV, all over the Internet, the radio:  Buy!  Bigger!  Better!  Buy!  Make the people you love happy!!  And we may get even more perplexed about how this connects to the Baby in the manger.  Though it does seem to relate to being generous, loving others as you love yourself.  Helping others who don’t have much in the way of food, shelter, clothing, toys.  The kind of things grown-up Jesus taught.   \\n\\n\\tSo as grown-ups, unless we got stuck acting like a kid in a grown-up body, we know it is all about GIVING, NOT RECEIVING.  Of course there is in all of us that self-focused little boy or girl inside of us who wants the big toys.  Be it gigantic flat-screen TV, an iPod, trip to a spa or that fancy vacation.  But most of the time, we remember that it is better to give than receive.  Grown-ups GIVE.  That’s what they do.  End of story.\\n\\n\\tReally?  I don’t think so.  Let’s return to the Christmas story.  Even with all the noisy angelic host, there is something strangely quiet and humble, about this story.  In other stories in the Bible, like Moses and escaping Pharaoh’s slavery in Egypt, Noah building an ark, God liberates and saves the chosen people by enlisting and prodding them.  But here, in strange story of God risks birthing through a young unmarried woman a baby in stable in an out-of-the-way place.  Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, the wiremen, they themselves take a risk as all receivers of a gift.  And we, as followers of the adult Jesus, are invited to risk being fully out of this simple story.  The mystery of God’s renewing presence among us, over and over, is something we RECEIVE.  \\n\\n\\tThere is a lot of adult comfort in being a GIVER.  It gives us a certain power, independence and control.  We name the time, the gift, the recipient.    How different from being a follower of the adult Jesus, where we willingly come empty-handed, humbly allowing another force besides our smarts and accomplishments to guide us.  \\n\\n\\tAnd here is the real challenge of Christmas for us grown-ups.  We have to learn to be receivers.   Children, their job is to learn to be givers.  A few adults still need to work on this too.  But for most grown-ups, I would say the big challenge found in the Christmas story is that we need to learn to loosen our grip a tad and learn to be RECEIVERS again.  \\n\\n\\tAnd the best presents may not come in wrapped boxes…the challenge for followers of Jesus is to learn to risk receiving love, someone’s trust in us.   To receive someone’s forgiveness.  To finally acknowledge and live as though we are not each a solo act.   To receive the mystery of connection between us and the God of the universe. \\n\\nReceiving as a child….learning to give as an adult…then opening to receive gifts of love and hope and allowing them be born in us.   Thanks be to God for such challenges and gifts.  Merry Christmas!  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe Micah text may be actually easier to relate to:  the prophet channels God’s frustration with the people of Jerusalem.  They are experiencing a time of prosperity and revival of their nation, but in the process are ignoring the poor and marginalized among them.  “Stop it already, with your elaborate sacrifices and pompous ceremonies,” says God.  “All I ask of you, I’ve already told you this, is that you do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with me as my partner.  Do the stuff that restores community, not fracture and corrupt it”.  \\n\\tJesus, however, begins his public ministry in an unsettled and precarious time for the Jewish people during the early first century.  They were living in occupied land, dominated by the repressive Roman regime and have little control over their communal lives.  The central religious question for Judaism at the time was: how do we do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with God, now in the midst of our enemies? \\n\\tNow Jesus shows up and is addressing the same issue of “how shall we live in this mess without going crazy” but in a new way:  he starts talking about being an alternative community in the present situation, but not by fighting it with violence or completely withdrawing from it.  Be an alternative community here, in light of the future reign, the empire of God….which was at hand!  Which was is within you!  What? (Feasting on the Word commentary, Fourth Sunday in Epiphany, Year A). This was a paradoxical message that both confused and challenged people.   To illustrate how to do this, he talked about how to live in this world of repression, competition and fear.  By recognizing God’s blessings.  Which, if we consider Matthew’s report, sound really strange.  \\nIn our contemporary world, we tend to associate God’s blessings with worldly goods and financial gain, with unexpected rescues from danger or reprieves from illness or catastrophe.  This is the message of the Prosperity Gospel which has gotten increasingly popular of late.  And there is a thread of this thinking laced through the Bible. Law abiding and righteousness would be rewarded by God, with wealth and well-being.  It’s part of our Protestant work ethic: if you work hard, you will be rewarded with abundance.  When we see others faced with poverty, with difficulties or disasters, we may even assume it is their fault. We tend to ignore the restrictions of systemic racism and classism, and figure people are just lazy if they are unemployed or unsuccessful.  If difficulties happen to us, we may start wondering if God has abandoned us, or is even punishing us.  But the teachings from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount seem to challenge this view of blessings of health and abundance as reward.  Let’s listen it again:  “Blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek, blessed are those who are reviled and persecuted, blessed are those who hunger and thirst…” How odd this sounds to us.\\nPart of the problem here is that it is hard for us to describe just what God is up to in our lives.  I know of a pastor who tried asking members his congregation to describe what God was up to in their lives.  He reports they stared back at him blankly.  He tried a different question: “well, what’s been keeping you awake at night?”  And one by one, the stories poured out.   It’s difficult, isn’t it, to talk about what God is up to in our lives.  We don’t want to sound overly pious, or even presumptuous.  But most of us can describe what keeps us up at night.  I think of those as “unblessings” – it’s easy to talk about those!\\nIn today’s passage, Jesus says all kinds of people are blessed who seemed particularly “unblessed” in their culture.  He claims that God is up to something in their lives:  Poor people, disempowered people, the grieving, the people working for peace, the persecuted.  Jesus is not suggesting that God caused these unfortunate circumstances.  No…simply that when we feel “unblessed” we may want to ponder what God is doing in us, in the midst of the mess.  \\nSimilar to the ancient world, we live in a predominant culture that values wealth, status, security and power.  Nationally, we have an aversion to foreign people who don’t seem very “blessed” with these things.  People who are poor, who are persecuted, who are fleeing trauma.  Jesus would say that they have a special connection with the kingdom of God, with inheriting the earth, with being filled and comforted.  But somehow, we see them as our enemies who must be excluded. \\nHere’s Jesus approach to relating to those we do not want to include: He lists the kinds of people who were being drawn to him, who knew their emptiness and their need for God, who could taste their search for meaning, who longed for healing and hope.  Over and over in the Biblical tradition, the care for people in these people was a sign of God’s realm breaking in.  We get to be part of this “breaking in” as we do justice, love kindness and walk humbly as God’s partners.\\n\\tBut what is the inner work that we have to do to make these actions happen with wisdom and consistency?  For starters, we can ponder the unblessings in our lives. How can these things that keep us awake, that tug at our attention and worry us, be the places where we are blessed?  As odd as this sounds, I am beginning to think that there are some possibilities here.  Because if I am honest, I have to admit that I seldom have trouble sleeping when I am feeling happy and peaceful about things.  I also seem to talk less with God during these contented times.  I’m running the show of my life and doing it well! Things that keep me awake at night are often connected to worries of screwing up the show: impending loss or lack of abundance, of being mis-understood or even rejected.  Our perceived “unblessings” often make us want to protect ourselves, to push people away, to form exlusive rules and place bans.  But could these challenges be places of God’s peculiar blessing? Where I have to face that my ego’s “safety and happiness plan” is not always helpful? Where I am thrown back on my dependence on God?  Could these be the worrisome conditions that actually help us grow, help us develop empathy with those who are struggling even more mightily than we are? \\n\\tThis week, notice a place in your life this week that seems “unblessed.”  Might this be a place where God is working in you, in that difficulty? God is nudging each us, challenging our assumptions and fears, softening and opening our hearts, pushing us forward.  May we continue to ponder God’s peculiar blessings in our lives.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tHere, the lighting of a single Advent candle.  Out there, growing profusion of holiday lights spreading through our neighborhoods, bright neon lights filling our shopping malls. “Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence,” we sing this morning.  Outside, the air is filled with “secular Christmas songs,” whatever that might mean.  What we Christians do at this time of year is clearly out-of-sync with much of the rest of the world!  One writer has described the four weeks of Advent which proceed Christmas Day, in this way:  “…the Christian New Years begins on an obscure Sunday in early winter when we rise in the dark…dress and eat in the gloom of a gray dawn.  It comes at a time when the Northern Hemisphere braces itself for a descent into the unlit, low-ceilinged root cellar of the year.  We light a candle, peer into the hushed and cobwebbed darkness, step over the dusty detritus of old harvests.  It will only get darker from here.“ (Light upon Light: A Literary Guide to Prayer for Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, compiled by Sarah Arthur, p. 12)  Advent…a time of silence, reflection, mystery.\\n\\n\\tBut lest we think we come to church during the weeks of a hectic December just for peace and quiet, like some spiritual “7-11” where we can grab a quart of inspiration before heading back into our holiday purchasing and festivities…..consider our texts for today.  Because these scriptures are truly going to lead us down into the “root cellar of the year.”  Basically, both Isaiah and the Gospel of Mark declare in no uncertain terms:  the world is a complete mess, and where the heck is God?  These are words written from dark places.  “O that you would tear open the heavens and come down,” pleads the prophet Isaiah, as he watches Israel’s devastation and dissolution in the wake of the Babylonian conquest, 586 BCE.  In a religious tradition that continually celebrated God’s redemptive deeds through history, the prophet stumbles on these promises of the rescuing God like tripping over “detritus of old harvests.”  Ancient ideas of God’s constant care are now challenged and God’s seeming absence is met with lamentation. The people have sinned and God has hidden Godself.  Everyone has made a mess of things.  These words sound eerily contemporary to me. \\n\\tDebie Thomas is a West coast essayist who occasionally writes on the Biblical commentary site “Journey with Jesus.”   Her posting this week was an honest and raw piece referring to the “Hard Gifts” of Advent ().   Recounting her despair following another student suicide at her daughter’s northern California high school, she resonated with Isaiah’s demands that the “Very Big God do some Very Big Things.”  Thomas writes, “Recalling the history of the Exodus, (Isaiah) asks God to once again do \"awesome deeds\"\\xa0— deeds that will make the mountains quake and the nations tremble.”  Come on God, “come to us as fire,” Isaiah pleads.  “Fire that kindles and burns, fire that sets the world boiling. Who among us has not prayed similarly?” Thomas asks.  Come on God, get busy, I want to say.  Just eradicate Ebola, won’t you?  And since we still have to acknowledge World AIDS day, will you please finally get rid of HIV/AIDS?  And God, while you are at it, this has been a particularly rough week, nationwide.  Communities across the country are divided over a Missouri Grand Jury decision to not indict a certain police officer for the shooting death of a certain unarmed teenager.  God, can you please clean up this mess?  Depending on our point of view about all this, we might plead with God about Ferguson in different ways: Come on God, eradicate racism, fix our criminal justice system and help us white people understand our privileged position in our nation. Or, we might be praying: Come on God, eradicate these erroneous views that there still is racial inequality in this country; make people of color more responsible or at less violent.  We may feel perplexed about the whole situation.  I imagine, however, we each have some pretty clear ideas about the Very Big Things our Very Big God should be doing.\\n\\n\\tSo this is the start of Advent, down in the “dark root cellar” of the church year.  We turn to the Gospel of Mark, hoping for some hopeful news of a sweet baby in the manger.  Instead, we encounter these foreboding apocalyptic, end-times sayings of Jesus, spoken right before his arrest.  Just as we are beginning to pull out our Christmas decorations, with their sentimental associations and memories, it’s like stumbling over more “dusty detritus of old harvests.”  Talk of the end-times? Oddly enough, Advent always begins with these passages about Israel’s sense of God’s desertion and Jesus’ describing the end times, when the whole earth will convulse and the heavens will break their cycle of days; distant stars, tiny blades of grass, everything will be affected when the Son of Man, the Son of the Human One, returns.  What are we to make of this?  \\n\\t\\n\\t Wait, says Advent, God is going to show up in places you do not expect.  The prophet hints at this: “Yet, O Lord, you are our loving Parent; we are the clay and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand,” writes Isaiah, in spite of all evidence to the contrary.   In Advent we learn about waiting, but waiting with an alertness that enables us to notice where God is breaking in among us.  Perhaps we notice where God is shaping us, like a potter shapes the clay in her hand. Wait, and see God working in the repeated blossoming of a fig tree, says Jesus, here in a story of waiting attentively for a master to return.  Advent cues us to consider how we are to stay engaged within the household of God.  But what does it look like to truly “stay awake, alert” in these times?\\n\\n\\tFor me, I feel called to stay alert to those things that are just out of view, and so easy to ignore.  And it’s been that way with unfolding evens surrounding Ferguson.  Among my mostly white world, where I live in a relatively safe cocoon of white privilege, there hasn’t much talk about Ferguson of late or even after the Grand Jury decision last week.  But in among the Facebook entries of Thanksgiving side dishes, photos of family gatherings and funny animal videos, I noticed that it was my UCC colleagues across the nation who kept publically grappling with these far-away events of the the Grand Jury decision and the ensuing country-wide protests.  The Rev. Geoffrey Black, President of our denomination, called for a renewed sacred conversation about race within our churches.  But it was the Rev. Allen Fluent, Acting Conference Minister of the Missouri Mid-South Conference of the United Church of Christ, in which Ferguson is located, who wrote a poignant and compelling pastoral letter to the wider UCC: (http://myemail.constantcontact.com/MMSUCC-eCourier---Wednesday--November-26--2014.html?soid=1109843076763&aid=hTJrqD-v0kI)\\n\\n\\t“We could not know what would come of the grand jury decision rendered last evening. For some, it meant a limited form of\\xa0justice.  For others, a frustrating dissonance with the truth as they see it. How you see the decision probably depends upon your whole orientation as a human being.  But is there more to see?  Mark’s Gospel lesson for this Sunday talks about people seeing more than they once were able to see. They see the Son of Man, who gathers the beloved of God, but not until a great cataclysm has occurred, when the powers of the heavens themselves are shaken….The disruption of the order of the world in (these words of Jesus)…is described as the climax of a time of great suffering, as though the heavens themselves give testimony to the wrongfulness all around, and there is a bursting of the firmament, which is now dissolved, and then, in new clarity, the bearer of God’s incisive truth breaks through with light and a brand new truth.”\\n\\t“Beloved, we need a brand new truth! We need something better than a grand jury truth, better than an assumption that real justice can be rendered in a setting where privilege and disadvantage go unremedied and unseen, better than all the efforts to find someone to blame. There is great sorrow for the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, but the greater sorrow is for the many young men who live today in hopelessness, because their future is bleak in the cities of America; and the greater sorrow is neighborhood businesses destroyed by a rage that is nurtured in people convinced that they have no place, and nothing to lose, within the economy of their urban setting; and the greater sorrow includes as well those law enforcement officers who walk fearful in their neighborhoods, because they are assigned to patrol hostile streets where they do not live, that are created by years of social neglect.”\\n\\t“First there was a moment of death that became a symbol, then the appearance of regarding it as nothing; then the anger; then the blaming; then the usual official reaction; then the protest and more blaming; then the verdict; then the fire and the looting; then the endless interpretations. Now we need a brand new truth. We need to be a part of it.”\\n\\tRev. Fluent then invites us to pray for the two local pastors of the United Church of Christ who have been appointed to the investigative Ferguson Commission by the Governor of Missouri.  And that we “Pray for the young people of Ferguson and other urban neighborhoods, where the dangers of childhood and the alienation of youth are daily challenges to hope.  Pray for the shopkeepers whose life dreams are destroyed by acts of vandalism.  Pray for the residents of neighborhoods made tense and untrusting by social forces beyond their control. Give thanks for those who are bringing help and comfort in these difficult times –those who march peacefully, who comfort, preach nonviolence and seek justice, and our friends and neighbors who engage in sacred conversations about race.”  We pray for the shattered lives of the family of Michael Brown and Police Officer Darren Wilson.  \\n\\tRev. Fluent concludes, “This is a day for re-envisioning, for seeing what we could not see before, for gathering with one another from the four winds of our differences, for sharing and volunteering and engaging one another in the ongoing ministry we share.”\\nAs we watch and wait this Advent, what new truths might we see and explore together, when it come to race, when it comes to honestly talking about white privilege, when it comes to our nation’s healing injustices of the past?  I believe that “racism is over” is akin to “dusty detritus of old harvests.”  In all this darkness, how might we claim that God is a God of life even when we see destruction and hurt all around us?  And so Advent begins.  May God guide us in observing a Holy Advent season.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIt has been said that “the Christmas Mystery has two parts:  the Nativity and the Epiphany.  “A deep instinct made the Church separate these two Feasts.  In the first we commemorate God’s humble entrance into human life, the emergence and birth of the Holy (among us in a new way), and in the second its manifestation to the world, the revelation of the Supernatural made in that life.”  So writes Evelyn Underhill, 20th century British contemplative writer and mystic (Advent with Evelyn Underhill, edited by Christopher L. Webber, p. 73).  “…The two phases concern our inner lives very closely too,” continues Underhill.   Or, put another way….we can’t have Christmas without Epiphany, the revealing or manifestation of Jesus to the world.  It struck me as I read her words, that you and I don’t get to have sweet baby Jesus for ourselves.  Christian faith is not a private matter.  All of this has to do with us being in the world in a totally different way.  But what does this look like?\\n\\n\\tOn Epiphany Sunday we hear again the Gospel writer Matthew’s account of the magi who follow the star to Jesus’ birthplace.\\tIt’s interesting to me that what our predominant culture most often associates with Christmas is not really about God, but about human connectedness.  “Home for the Holidays” is the pervasive advertising theme, with scenes of families and friends smiling and embracing, sharing festive foods and thoughtful gifts.   And there is something very tender and poignant at the center of all this; the sense of hopefulness, or relief, in having loved ones gather together.  The heart-warming sense that we feel loved and appreciated.  There is something about Christmas, and winter celebrations in colder climates, which seem to trigger feelings about personal relationships with other humans.  We may find ourselves pondering our ways in which we belong and feel separate from those around us. \\n\\n\\tBut the season of Epiphany following Christmas helps put this kind of wondering in the broader perspective of God’s reality around and among us.  Christmastime is bigger and deeper than us getting closer to family and friends, helping some local charities and having a cozy time of it.  The story of the magi, a Greek word for wise ones or astrologers, is a curious narrative that pulls us out of our private, familiar world.  Matthew, the only Gospel writer to include the story, describes foreign, possibly Zoroastrian priestly star-gazers from the East, some 1000 miles away in Persia, who bring odd baby gifts foretelling both a glorious and somber future for the newborn King.  The cast of characters broadens as the magi encounter the wicked and desperate King Herod.  A fawning puppet ruler indebted to the occupying Roman Emperial power, Herod is so fearful of a new rival in Jesus, that he massacres all Jewish baby boys in a bloody attempt to stop Jesus’ purported rise to political power.  Joseph and Mary receive the strange gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh only to flee the scene after being warned in a dream of Herod’s malicious intent.  \\n\\n\\tThe author of this story, whoever he was, was not one of Jesus disciples.  He lived and wrote much later in the first century to his Christian community that included many non-Jewish Gentiles. Biblical scholars have suggested that he included this story in an attempt to affirm to the early church that Jesus was connected to non-Jews. These people would have been viewed as newcomers, outsiders, since they had not been raised in Jesus’ tradition of Judaism.  In his book about Jesus, the author Matthew was interested in showing how outsiders from another religion and culture fit into the Jewish Jesus’ story.   I love how Evelyn Underhill describes the arrival of the wise men: “It is easy for (us church members),” she writes, “to join up with the Shepherds and fall in place around the manger and look out into the surrounding night.”  She imagines us saying to each other: “look at those (magi), those extraordinary intellectuals wandering about after a star, with no religious sense at all! …..Look what (inappropriate) gifts and odd types of self- consecration they are bringing; not the sort of people who come to church!”  The magi are the outsiders and Underhill slyly nails our resistance to newcomers who are different from us.  We talk about wanting church growth, bigger budgets and fuller pews, yet are often hesitant to share the life of the church with those who are different from us.  With those who have different life experiences, love different sorts of people, or come closer to God through different kinds of music or worship expression.  Because if these folks really got involved….our church might change.  How are those who seem like outsiders welcomed, enfolded, given a voice in our life together, nurtured in the faith here?     \\n\\t\\n\\tAs the Christmas season draws to a close, we hear the Gospel writer John’s words about Jesus one final time.  Using poetic heart language, John spins a net of words that hold great mystery:  Word, beginnings, the Word with God, creating all things, Light, Darkness.  The Light coming into the world and changing human darkness.  Could it be that Jesus is the spilling over of God’s inner self, God’s light and loving heart and eternal fellowship with the world?  “The Word became flesh and lived among us.”  This Christmas thing, this Incarnation God-with-us part, this has been going on since before Creation started.   And because you and I are born, are part of Creation, it is all tangling up in us.  Revealed in us.  \\n\\nAs we struggle to make sense of the Christmas mystery, I suggest we continue to soak in these stories.  Tales of strangers bringing news of a new born king.  Poetry that attempts to describe the indescribable through speaking “side-ways” about a possibility, a reality that our rational, logical, 21st century scientific-leaning language will never fully explain.  This possibility that we are all welcome into God’s embrace, even when we feel far off.  We are all bathed in this Light, even as we encounter darkness is so much of our lives and the world around us.  We are radiant in God’s presence, which is everywhere.  We are created to reflect this Light out into the world.  Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine!  Amen.\\n\\t\\n(Closing hymn:  “This Little Light of Mine” – piano and tambourine)\\t \\n',\n",
       " '\\tAfter hearing these two scripture passages, one might well wonder about the call for adherence Biblical “family values”  -  the legendary first trio of monotheism, Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, all caught in a dysfunctional and painful web of slavery, class differences, infertility, polygamy, surrogate motherhood, jealously, and retribution.  We should emulate this family?  Things are further complicated as we overhear Jesus telling his disciples: “I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother…one’s foes will be members of one’s own household….I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”   Is Jesus suggesting there is something more important than family?  \\n\\tIn the church, we speak rather loosely, even blithely, about all being part of God’s family….we identify God as a loving parent, using the traditional language of Father and even exploring the awkward to our ears language of Mother God.  Clearly, families and family lineage and descendents was important throughout Biblical history.  This is why Abraham, Sarah and Hagar get in such a reproductive pickle and end up with both Issac and Ishmael: God’s promise of survival, nationhood, being a witness of justice and compassion to other nations meant they needed babies.  Family was important in Near Easter culture.  The apostle Paul refered to Christians as brothers and sisters in Christ, adopted into the original family of the Jewish covenant.  And we fondly refer to our congregations as being like a family, in describing the closeness among the members and the comfort this brings us.\\t  We’re like one big happy family, I’ve heard many a church tell me.\\n\\tMulling over all these familial references this week, I couldn’t help but notice a blog article written by Rev. Anthony Robinson, a UCC minister known for his sharp commentary on contemporary church.  “Quit Thinking of the Church as a Family!” shouted headline.  He described how he had recently worked with a church that had engaged the “services of a national firm to do a ministry audit prior to Robinson’s arrival.”  #1 recommondation of the ministry audit:  “The most important thing that Church X will ever do is end whatever amount of ongoing conflict exists as well as quit thinking like a family.”  Stop fighting the way you have been fighting – I get that.  But don’t be like a family?  This blunt directive appartently miffed quite a few people in the Church X.  But here was the consulting group’s rationale:  “The purpose of the church is to transform both society and individuals to be more Christ-like.  This concept goes way beyond family.”  Or, as Robinson has put it in many of his writings, “the purpose of the church is to change lives….that’s the business we are in….forming and sustaining faithful and courageous people.”\\n\\tSometimes this does happen in families.  But something problematic often happens when a church tries to be one big happy family:  the focus is usually on keeping the membership comfortable and satisfied.  In order to seem “loving and nice,” congregations often avoid asking the tough questions, speaking openly about disasagreemetns or holding one another accountable to standards of respect, compassion and forgiveness.   Families sometimes keep secrets, and so do churches…not wanting to speak the truth to one another.  And it is really hard to break into many families; visiting a church can be like stumbling into someone’s family reunion without nametages: where everyone knows each others name, and stories…..and you don’t.   And, and Robinson points out, “our church is like a family” can be heard as “our church is for families.”  Those who are not married, or whose families look “nontraditional” due to single parenthood, parenting of grandchildren, parenting with two Moms or two Dads….our predominant culture is rapidly stretching the meaning of family to be more inclusive and diverse…..and churches must be ready to welcome and receive and minister to these newly defined families.  \\n\\tI wonder sometimes what God thinks about our communal family life and church life.  I believe Jesus to be one who uniquely reveals to us the heart and intentions of God.  In today’s Matthew reading he subverts my conventional understanding of family and challenges me to consider a higher allegiance in my own life.  Reaching further back to this story about Hagar and her son Ismael, I find my notion of both family and God’s ways with humans to be challenged again.  The Book of Genesis tells of how Abraham had been confronted by God in a burning bush, and that this encounter propelled him and his wife Sarah out into the desert to follow God’s lead.  But the divine promise remained strangely unfulfilled: your descents will be as numerous as the stars in the night sky and you will be a great nation.  An Egyptian slave-girl named Hagar is added to their household during their travels.   In view of the couple’s apparent infertility, Sarah takes matters into her own hands, and insists that Abraham try for children with her slave.  Hagar becomes pregnant, and later is contemptuous of her master Sarah, Sarah becomes jealous and furious, Abraham shrugs and says she is your slave do with her what you want, Sarah deals with her harshly (roughs her up?) and caught in this drama about both race and class, pregnant Hagar flees into the wilderness.  An angel of the Lord finds her and promises that God will greatly multiply her offspring from her unborn child.  You will call this child “Ismael,” meaning “Gods hears me.”  Hagar ends up “naming the Lord who spoke to her” (this is fairly dramatic in a patriarchal culture!) called the Lord “El-roi – or “God sees me.”  God hears me; God sees me.  Apparently God’s loving care goes beyond a particular family group and hereditary line.  \\n\\tHagar returns to the family and eventually gives birth to a son named Ismael.   Soon after, God converses with Abraham and outlines plans for a covenant between God and Abrahams many descendents.  God promises that Sarah will become pregnant and the son will be named “Issac – he laughs.”  Actually Sarah laughs when she hears this news, since they are now both so old.  But Sarah becomes miraculously pregnant and gives birth to Issac, saying: “God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.\\n\\tBut at some point all this laughter stops. This happens in families and it happens in churches.  A time of hope is overshadowed by a change of events, a broken trust, a personal mistake, a strong disagreement.  During a celebration feast for Issac’s weaning, Sarah catches the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with her son Issac….the word can also mean mocking.  Sarah sees her son, the rightful heir in her view, being ridiculed.  All hell breaks loose in the household; Abraham frantically consults God who tells him to leave it to Sarah.  “Get rid of her and her son,” Sarah demands.  Abraham gives Hagar some water and bread, and she departs into the wilderness again….this time with a frightened child in tow.\\n\\tOut in the wilderness, food and water depleated, Hagar is weeping, the boy is wailing.  God hears.  An angel calls to Hagar and says “do not be afraid…God hears you…a great nation will be made from this boy….the promise includes you two.”  God intends to reach beyond family bonds to include those cast out.   And Hagar’s eyes were opened and she found water and they both drank deeply and were saved.  Ishmael grows up in the wilderness, becomes an accomplished archer, and his mother find’s him a wife from the land of Egypt.  Story makes a full circle.  Centuries later, a prophet named Mohamend is descended from the line Hagar and Ishmael and Islam is born.  \\n\\tGod stretches family bonds….God is loyal beyond family ties.  Important for early Christians because admitting that you followed Jesus could get you in trouble with all kinds of people: The people in Matthew’s community found comfort in the remembered words of Jesus, especially where he would tell them not to be afraid.   They remembered his claim that following him was not necessarily going to bring them family harmony. Jesus claimed that loyalty to his teachings, to his way of being in the world, loyalty to God’s purposes, was to be their first priority.  And they were not to be afraid if this got them in trouble.  God sees you.  God hears you.  God pays attention even to the tiny sparrows….and counts the hairs on your head.   \\n\\tFamilies can be very precious to us, and families come and go through our lives.  Today I am reminded of the constancy that runs beneath family….God sees us and hears us, and draws us together into a radically inclusive community of change and transformation.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tAs we saw last week, the church’s liturgical calendar does an odd thing right before the Christmas rush begins.  It brings us problematic scripture readings about God’s judgment and the ends times.  Our texts come from the Revised Common Lectionary, which is followed by both Protestant and Catholic congregations around the world.  Today, they pull us back to the tense days following the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian empire 6th century BCE, and also to 1st century CE, the time right before Jesus’ arrest and execution.  These are prickly passages, seemingly unfit for happy Thanksgiving Sunday.  Time to make some pies and turkey stuffing, and then we get to start all the familiar and sweet baby stories about Jesus’ joyful birth!  But this final Sunday in the Christian year has been traditionally called “Christ the King Sunday.”  Both our texts challenge us to consider some of the wider questions of “who is in charge” and what is the nature of that rule?\\n\\tAs progressive Christians who take the Bible seriously but not literally, many of us cringe at these Biblical references to a judging God.  No hell fire and brimstone for us, we intone.  Many people come to the United Church of Christ because they have felt judged, vilified, excluded by other Christian congregations.  Like Benjamin Franklin, sometimes I too want to take out my scissors and do some excising of these troublesome passages.\\n\\n\\tBut the more I study our scriptures, I have come to realize that careful and compassionate judgment is an important step on the way to justice.   This idea is foundational to Judaism, and was the bedrock of Jesus teachings.  I invite us to consider first this passage from the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel, who wrote during an immensely trying period of Jewish history.  I have been helped in my reflections by the research of Margaret Odell, a Professor of Religion at St. Olaf College here in Minnesota. She has written extensively on the Book of Ezekiel, the prophet who lived during the time of the Babylonian exile of the Jews.  During the sixth century BCE, their huge beautiful temple and the city of Jerusalem had been sacked.  Their rulers, religious leaders, scholars, artisans had all been dragged off into captivity In Babylon.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWriting in a recent on-line Biblical commentary (http://www.workingpreacher.org/preaching.aspx?commentary_id=2188), Odell notes that Ezekiel’s words to the exiled community include the ancient imagery of sheep and shepherd.  She writes, “God visits the flock to “take stock” of the damage after it has been scattered. ‘Taking stock’ is an act of judgment, of discerning need before taking action. ….What ensues is a rescue operation, as God seeks out the sheep from all the countries to which they have been scattered.”  The false shepherds are the human rulers who have perpetrated injustice by not caring for those on the margins.  God “reverses the abuses of the false shepherds,” Odell continues, and “explicitly corrects situations that might perpetuate injustice and abuse in the future: ‘I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy.’” \\n\\n\\tThis all sounds rather harsh from a supposedly loving God, but apparently God has a strong preference for the weak, the marginalized, those ignored by our predominate culture.  Professor Odell concludes: “The connection is summed up in verse 16, where the means for delivering care is justice: ‘I will feed them with justice.’ Justice and care are kept in balance, as if they were two sides of the same coin.”  \\n\\n\\tJustice and care belong together in our religious tradition.   The shepherd metaphor was always first and foremost a political metaphor; it related to compassionate and just leadership. To be a king was to be a shepherd entrusted with the care of the sheep.  Sheep have to be fed and cared for, not only with food and shelter.  The systems that limit the resources of food and shelter also have to be challenged and changed.   We see Jesus continuing to call political systems to this kind of justice. \\n\\tOur gospel reading from the Book of Matthew brings us this story of “The Great Judgment.”  We don’t find this particular version of the end of time in any other gospel, and it seems to be directed to ongoing concerns in Matthew’s post-Resurrection community.  We remember that the author is writing a theological statement that reflects on the meaning of the life of Jesus for his own community in the later part of the first century.  He grapples with ongoing tensions around discipleship, “taking stock” and making just judgments in their church, as they try and figure out what it means to be a faithful follower of Jesus separate from the synagogues and separate from the surrounding gentile culture.  His community lives in a time when Roman Empire power is increasingly oppressive, and where many continued to expect a Messiah or anointed king to overthrow the dominant regime and bring liberation to the people of Israel.  Within this tension, the young Christian communities claimed that God’s realm had indeed been revealed in their midst, through Jesus.  The Kingship of the Risen Christ was not about power and privilege, but was about mercy and justice.   \\n\\n\\tIn today’s story, Matthew draws an imaginative picture of a future time when Jesus returns in triumph as a great cosmic King and Judge over all the world.  Keeping in mind this ongoing tension between “the Kingdom is here” and the “Kingdom is not quite yet,” we consider this wildly expansive vision of Matthew: all the people of the world will be somehow gathered before the Son of Man, the Son of the Human One, in all his glory (a messianic vision from Hebrew scripture), and a great sorting out and separating will take place.  Some will inherit the kingdom and some will not.   Here described as “sheep” and “goats,” the people will be divided one from another, depending upon how they have taken care of the King when he was hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick and imprisoned.   Good to remember that this is a story, not a literal prediction of sheep and goats starting to speak.   Nor does the story necessarily assign certain groups of people to burn in hell.  In this story, both “sheep” and “goats” end up sounded a tad confused:  None of them seem to know when they saw the King hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison.  “When did we see you?” they ask earnestly. \\n\\n\\tMost major world religions have a similar teaching:  a kindness done to someone in need or particularly to a stranger is considered an act of devotion to the Divine.  In traditional Jewish lore, any act of kindness done to a human was as if one had done it to God.  Matthew’s listeners would remember this, and understand immediately: they were to be like the “sheep” that see and minister to the needy people. This is what it means for them to inherit God’s kingdom.  Our leaders (our shepherds, in the Biblical language), our laws and we citizens must all work together to serve those in need, in order to be a just society.\\n\\n\\tSeveral Biblical commentators have noted that what the “goats” did was not see.  It’s what they don’t do that condemns them in the story, or as we often identify in our prayer of confession: those sins of omission.  I can resonate with this, as I look back in my life.  Some of my deepest regrets about decisions I have made are related to times when I just didn’t notice or perceive something: the hidden meaning in what someone was saying, the quiet voice within my own heart and mind.   Perhaps this awareness of “not seeing” is what ultimately judges us.\\n\\n\\tI will never forget how one day, years ago, I “chose” to ignore a certain indigent-appearing person on the streets of San Francisco.   I was a new minister in my late-twenties, hustling from a parking garage south of Market Street, in the impoverished and somewhat dangerous Tenderloin district.  I was headed to a denominational meeting.  I was in a hurry.  I was trying to ignore the shabbily dressed street people approaching me for spare change.  But I noticed this man sitting on the ground, eyes closed, slumped against a building.  Was he passed-out drunk? High? Sick? Dead?  I hesitated for a moment, feeling confused and scared, and then kept on walking.   When I returned several hours later to my car, passing the same spot, the man was gone.  Was he ambling down another street? Taken to the ER or maybe the city morgue?  I will never know.  I didn’t look at him long enough, really see him, to be moved to a merciful action of some kind.  I am still not exactly sure what I might have done.  But, I don’t think saw the Risen Christ in him.\\n\\t\\n\\tSomething to mull over this week, while we go through our daily round:  What am I not noticing?  What choices have I made, or am making now, because I refuse to really look and see the needs of God’s creation around me?\\nMaybe the judgment we all face is not from somewhere on high, at the end of time or the moment of our death.  The judgment you and I face is now; it is spoken by the need of the person right in front of us.  On the evening news, in the newspaper, on line, through the radio, on the street in front of us.  What is it that God would have us see?  How would God have us respond?  How very curious that Christ the King, all-powerful in his all-encompassing reign, needs us to take care of him.   This is a mystery I do not fully understand.   But what might we notice, where will we see the face Jesus, what might we do differently?  This is the gospel challenge, this is the Good News. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tThe stories about Jesus healing people seem natural and believeable to some of us.  And these dramatic descriptions of sudden curing of chronic conditions just seem too much of a stretch for others of us.  Not to mention wrapping your minds around someone who has already died being raised from the dead!  The Gospels describe numerous stories of Jesus healing all kinds of people.  Faithful Christians down through the centuries have pondered and debated about whether these stories are to be understood literally (yes, Jesus actually did this). Or understood in some symbolic way (as poetic descriptions for broader coming to wholeness of mind, body and spirit).  \\n\\tI meet with a group of Cambridge clergy early each Monday morning for Bible study.  It’s a lively group of both Protestants and Catholics, white and black pastors, lots of different beliefs and opinions.  Each of our congregations follow the Revised Common Lectionary, the three year cycle of scripture readings that takes us through major themes of the Old and New Testament.  After making some coffee and reading a unison prayer together, we focus on one of the four assigned passages and go at it.  \\n\\tOur group had a tough time with this healing story from the Gospel of Mark.  As we just heard, this is really two healing stories: one story about Jesus healing a 12 year old daughter of a prominent synagogue leader, with another story of his healing an unknown woman suffering from a debilitating chronic illness, inserted into the middle of the first story.  “Come quick, says the frantic dad.  Jesus turns to follow, but big crowd, people pressing in on him.  But suddenly he is startled: Hey wait a minute, I feel power flowing out of me!  His eyes sweep the crowd.  Whoa, who touched me?  A middle age woman steps forward, pleading and falling at his feet.  Major boundary violation here:  an unaccompanied woman, with an illness that makes her impure in that culture, reaching out to touch a rabbi in public.  And a major delay while he stops and gently, reassuringly speaks with this frantic but now healed woman. \\n\\tBut oh no, now it is too late: people come from the religious leader’s house with the awful news that the young sick daughter is dead!  Jesus surveys the weeping crowd outside the house:  “do not fear, only believe,” only trust, he says and goes inside.  There Jesus takes the dead girl’s hand, saying “little girl, stand up,” and she gets up and lives.\\n\\tAs our pastors’ group listened to this passage read aloud, several of us around the table sighed deeply.  Each of us at some point in our ministry have experienced people in our flocks being healed, but we have also known adults, teens and children who have not been healed.   Even with all the hopes and prayers and good intentions of an army of loved ones, church members, community folks and medical personnel.  And when it comes to young people not being healed, well you can imagine how that hit home for some of us around the table.  As we shared some of our struggles to make sense and meaning in such suffering, one pastor finally said quietly:  “you know, all the people Jesus healed in his ministry eventually died.”  This didn’t answer why people are not healed for me, but it did put the reality of illness, accident, and healing in a wider perspective.      \\t\\n\\tAnd returning to the story of this younger woman and older woman being healed, perhaps this is the first piece we might notice and even take to heart.   While cured at one point, they both eventually died.  And we each will eventually die.  Gradually or suddenly, this we do not know and maybe this isn’t even written in stone anywhere.   Even a story about healing should invite us into this broader consideration:  what does it mean to live each of my days, each of my hours, holding gently, realistically the awareness that I too will die?  And that probably before I die, I will loose some more of my loved ones, if I haven’t lost them already.  Not to hold this thought morbidly, in a way that robs me of life-giving thought and action. But to remember that our eventual dying is not because God doesn’t care, or God is punishing us.  This is the way of our created order.  God made it this way.   To say we need to value each day, each human encounter, each sunrise, sounds quite trite.  And yet it is the truth.  This valuing, this appreciating, this paying attention to our own breathing selves with blood pumping; this noticing of the alive people around us: everyday we get a chance to practice this.  Let it be the first thing we think of when we wake up in the world.  Wow, thank-you God I am alive.  The last thing before we go to sleep.  Thank-you God that I experienced the gift of this day (no matter if it was a great day or a day filled with hassely surprises and challenges!).\\n\\tThe other piece I see in these two stories is about healing itself.  What does it mean for us to ask for healing?  What does healing really mean?  I am reminded of a story I heard a colleague share recently:  He told of a friend of his, a man of deep faith, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in his early 50’s.  His family and his church prayed that he might be healed.  Some 20 years later, he was in the final states of this progressive and debilitating disease.  But strangely enough, the man claimed that he had been healed!  “I have been healed,” he insisted, “not of Parkinson’s disease, but I have been healed of my fear of Parkinson’s disease.”  (story from Feasting on the Word, Year B, Vol. 3, page 190, Michael L. Lindvall).   I heard this many times during the years I was a hospital chaplain, working with people with cancer especially.  Stories of how calm and courage  was replacing fear, family members reuniting and becoming closer over the course of illness, the person with cancer often describing feeling more connected to loved ones and to God.  Not all the time, but often enough to shake my limited preconceptions about “what is healing?”\\n\\tBut then what does prayer for healing do?  Does it actually work, we might wonder?  What we may have to face is that it works, from our perspective, if we get what we pray for.   Healing prayer sometimes works as other kinds of healing happen in the midst of the original problem.  \\n\\tBut again, we tread carefully here, because the answers can seem so awfully trite, and even cold-hearted:  Sometimes God’s answer is yes, sometimes its is no.  One would think that this request about a young girl, 12 years old and at the beginning of womanhood, would be the most important for Jesus to honor.  Yet, oddly enough, Jesus allows himself to be interrupted and stalled, on the way to Jairus the father’s house.   An obscure woman falls before Jesus, admits her boldness and tells him the whole truth of her years of physical pain, dwindling resources and being ostracized by a culture that believes her to be unclean.   “Daughter,” Jesus says to her, “go in peace and be healed of your disease.” Touch, connection, intimacy…it all happens in a flash and so much more than her chronic infirmity is healed.  \\n \\tI don’t believe we manipulate God and change the divine will through prayer.  But I do believe that God yearns for our wholeness, of bodies, of mind, of spirit, of relationships.   I do not understand all the mysteries of why some are healed and some are not.  It grieves me deeply when accident and disease cripple or take people before they have lived a long, ripe life.  But I believe that God created us with vulnerable and corruptible bodies and ultimately finite lives.  And I believe that this reality makes having a body all the more precious.  I believe our prayers for the healing of others draw us closer to God’s good intentions, and closer together as communities.  The prayers start to change us.  Notice what shifts in you this week, as you continue to pray for healing of others and yourself.  Do not fear says Jesus; trust in God’s abiding goodness.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tRather curious to hear these two scriptures passages read together this morning.  The Apostle Paul talking about love, calling his fellow Christians to not be arrogant or rude or insisting on their own way.  And then Luke’s abrupt conclusion to the story we read last week, where Jesus is first received with welcome approval by his hometown as he speaks in his synagogue, but in today’s finale he proceeds to royally tick-off his neighbors.  To the point where they want to throw him off a cliff.  “Don’t be rude,” directs Paul.  “Listen to me as I confront you in a rude manner,” insists Jesus.  A better title for this sermon reflection might have been:  Jesus Picks a Fight: What’s Love Got to Do with This?\\n\\tLet’s move back into the scene in the synagogue and see if we can figure out what the great teacher of loving our neighbors as ourselves is doing… besides raising people’s hackles.   In the beginning of his ministry, Jesus traveled around speaking in different synagogues throughout Galilee.  In this story, he returns to his hometown Nazareth and attends worship in the synagogue with what are probably family and neighbors.  Like other men in the community, he takes a turn reading from the Hebrew scriptures; his portion is from the prophet Isaiah.  It tells about the Messiah, the expected savior of Israel who will bring good news of rescue to the poor, and release to the captives, and healing to the blind, all signs of God’s in-breaking reign of mercy and justice.  Jesus has just sat down, everyone is staring at him, and he has said, rather astoundingly to those assembled, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  Hmmmm… …murmur several people, interesting….isn’t this Joseph’s son?  Can’t you see them nudge each other: “I remember when he was just a boy, helping in his father’s carpenter shop!”  No one seems too disturbed at this point.  But then Jesus launches into this rambling diatribe, accusing the congregation that they are getting ready to oppose him.  He suggests they will demand some kind of favoritism, special miracles like he did in other towns, because he their home-town man.  Then, Jesus finishes off this assault with provocative references to several great Jewish prophets:  Elijah and Elisha, each who brought God’s mercy and compassion to outsiders.  This what finally ticks off the Nazareth crowd, because these are references to their history when they, the chosen people, did not seem to be favored.  In the first case, the prophet Elijah ignored needy Israelite widows during a famine and brought aid to a Phoenician widow, restoring and empowering her to new life.  In the second, the prophet Elisha chose among many needy lepers to heal a Syrian military commander of his leprosy, restoring and empowering him to new life.   The widow and the commander were both Gentiles, outsiders.  The healing power of God’s kingdom is to extend to those we consider to be outsiders, is what Jesus is really saying.  \\n\\tAnd the people get it and they are “filled with rage.”   Why so angry? When the marginalized are truly empowered, it tends to change the status quo.  Our resistance to this, as the insiders, seems naturally ingrained, because it may  mean loss of advantage and priviledge.    No wonder the crowd wants to get rid of him.  \\n\\tRowan Williams, former Archbishop of Cantebury and  head of the Anglican Church has been known for inviting outsiders into conversation.  He would invite those out on the edges of British society and the Anglican church, into open dialogue about spirituality and faith.  Out of these experienes, he wrote Tokens of Trust: An Introduction to Christian Belief.   He talks about one of the earliest formulations of the Christian faith, known as the Apostles Creed.  The first line of which reads:  “I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth.”  Williams admits that the patriarchal language of God as Father is problematic for some of us, but he focuses on the idea that belief is more an act of trust than intellectual assent.  It’s about trust in a loving relationship; a trust that in some essential way, we are held safe.  Not a fantasy safety where we will never be ill or injured or die.  But an inner awareness of an anchorage, a refuge, that holds our very being.  He makes an unusual comparison between this first phrase of the ancient creed and the “formula used by Buddhists when they make their statement of common purpose to their community: (A Buddhist will say) ‘I take refuge in the Buddha’, meaning, “the Buddha is where I belong, the Buddha is what I have confidence in to keep me safe.” What Williams is getting at is that our beliefs aren’t primarily intellectual ideas; they are really descriptions of a place, an inner anchorage in love, where we “find solid ground, home.”   “In you, O Lord, I take refuge,” wrote the Psalmist years ago.  What a marvelous breath-prayer to take into our week:  “In you” (inhale and pause).  “I take refuge “ (exhale and pause). \\nJesus seemed to sense his eternal refuge in God’s love; it’s what enabled him to do his ministry of teaching and healing in spite of the opposition.  His refuge in God was not a place of safety, but the place out of which he received both God’s loving comfort and God’s challenge to him.  It’s what empowered him to push the assumed boundaries of God’s mercy, even when gravely threatened.\\n\\tIn his commentary on this Luke passage, New Testament scholar Matt Skinner raises the question:  “what if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?”  That seemed to be what the folks in Nazareth were angry about.  Skinner takes a provocative leap himself in his article entitled “Immigration Reform and the Challenges of Generosity,” suggesting that we too “resist outsiders and their empowerment.”  “To empower certain people toward citizenship scares many in Americas,” he continues.  “Do we fear loosing our advantage, our priviledge?”  he asks.  In our fear, do we loose track of supporting family unity and hard work and people in need?  “What if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?” asks Skinner (Odyssey Networks, 1/29/13 posting).\\n\\tJesus challenged the hometown crowd to face their own assumptions about preferential treatment.  There had always been tension in ancient Israel between the sense of their being God’s special, chosen people and God’s ongoing outreach to the outsider.  Jesus’ message, the Good News, would be focused on the marginalized, the ones who everyone on the inside were figuring just didn’t belong.\\n\\tEmbracing this Good News is a big order for us Christian community.  Especially since, for most congregations, the marginalized people are both inside and outside the church membership.  I think Paul really understood how hard it is for a diverse group of people to work together for God’s Kingdom on earth.  His church at Corinth was filled with diverse opinions, various perspectives on the faith, different gifts for ministry.   Our toughest prophetic task may be to be the kind of place where theological, economic, social and political diversity does not unravel the unity and the loving interactions of Emmaus.  Perhaps our greatest witness as the church is to provide this experience of loving refuge, as it flowers in our patience and kindness with one another.  Encouraged and strengthened in this refuge of love, we are better able to reach out to the outsiders and disempowered beyond our doors.  All this is made possible because we take refuge ourselves in the living, loving God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe narrative then focuses on the descendants of Shem, one of Noah’s sons.  The Biblical writers would want us to know that God is on to a new strategy of mending this broken universe God has created.  God focuses in on one group of people, rather randomly it would seem, to do a bold new thing. Against a background of broken, divided and violent humanity, God will bless this man and his wife, their descents, and make of them a great nation.  Why?  These folks are not particularly special or God.  God is simply deeply invested in this human enterprise.  God now invites a particular people to be a blessing to the rest of the world through the way that they will live.  Jesus would hear this as his family history.\\n\\tGod invites Abram and his descendents into co-creatorship; to engage in a communal ethic that would promote justice and mercy as an example and blessing to the world.  But only, and here is the catch, only if Abram is willing to take a risk: to leave the ties of kinship in his nomadic community that assured his identity, economic well-being and physical security.  God says to Abram: You are going to need to trust me.  I’m not going to be specific about where you and your immediate family are headed. Leave your securities and I will show you, on a need to know basis.  You are going to have to take a risk here.   New life entails risk.  As Jesus grew older, I wonder what risks he contemplated?\\nWhich makes me wonder….What risks are you and I willing to take these days, when we sense a call to new life?  Especially collectively, in an era where we are being told our identity, our economic well-being, our physical security and now our own health depends on pulling in, building walls, hunkering down?  \\n\\tFast forward thousands of years to what will become this couples’ descendents: Jews of all different perspectives and practices, living under Roman rule in and around Jerusalem in the early first century CE.  Jesus and his people have come a long way as a nation, times of peace and prosperity, enduring foreign domination, exile, return to rebuild…..and now the repressive Roman occupation.  The insidious presence of an imperial culture that demanded taxes, military conscription, and appalingly, worship of their Emperor Augustus.  \\n\\tThe Pharisees of the day were the legal scholars who helped people interpret the Jewish Torah, the law, for the present day situation that was full of risks.  The Pharisees approach to living among the Roman enemy was mostly a “quietly resist in place” strategy.  One was to carefully follow the guidance of the law, in hopes that this collective righteousness would provide fertile ground for the return of God’s righteous reign on earth.  \\n\\tBy the time of this particular night-time encounter, Jesus and his disciples had arrived in Jerusalem for the Jewish Passover. They will soon run into trouble with the local authorities. The Pharisee Nicodemus was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders.  Clearly a respected and important community leader.  But why was he sneaking around town in the dark?  Was he worried what his Jerusalem colleagues would think if he talked with Jesus?  Many of the Pharisees were increasingly concerned that Jesus’ teachings and rabble rousing would bring down the wrath of the Romans on the whole Jewish community.  But there was also an ancient tradition that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the complexities and marvel of the text.  Nichodemus takes a risk, and comes to “study” Jesus in the still of the night. \\n\\tIn our imagination, we see Jesus answer the quiet knock at the door.  They sit together in the dim light.  Nicodemus respectfully addresses him as “rabbi,” revered teacher.   We hear the caution in Nicodemus’ words; he politely acknowledges Jesus is from God, (not divine, from God) because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  But Jesus seems to ignore Nicodemus’ careful opening words and replies curtly:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  “Excuse me? What?” Nicodemus may well have responded.  Born from above, also translated as “born again or anew.”\\n\\tThis language of being born again, has been incredibly divisive in the Christian church.  Same with the following verse about believing so you can have eternal life.  These few passages have made for a lot of stereotypes and bad press about purportedly exclusive Christian claims.  I am talking about the assumption that you are either in or you are out, depending on what you believe.  This has had disastrous historical consequences, of course, as anyone considered out has, at various times in church history, been shamed, excluded, persecuted and/or killed.  \\n\\tBut notice that Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God, like it is a locality, or, as many assume, a place we might arrive after we die.  He talks about “seeing,” or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, reign of justice and compassion among us.  Jesus speaks as if it is already here, all around and even within us.  Our problem seems to be with a deeper perception of the eyes of the heart.  “No one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew” replies Jesus in an intentionally ambiguous response. It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  Great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us!   Logic and linear thinking solve many problems in life, but are little help in discovering God’s mystery and purpose in our lives.  How wrap our minds around all this?\\nCan we risk perceiving in a different way? \\nPerhaps the Kingdom of God is a place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Perhaps he is describing a transformed awareness that “doesn’t make separations between God and humans” between Muslims and Christians, between Republicans and Democrats. It’s as though Jesus is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension that is already there, welcoming him. (The contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault  Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind.  p. 30.) \\n Nicodemus can’t see or imagine himself being born again or anew or from above. That process looks too unknown, too problematic, too risky. He gets stuck in a literal interpretation.  He can’t grasp that Jesus is talking about a transformative experience of the living God through knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to the Jesus in front of him.  \\t\\n\\t“For God so loved the world, the cosmos, that God gave God’s only Son, so that everyone who believes the Son may not perish but may have everlasting life,” Jesus continues.  What was he really saying here?  “Your theological concepts need to be correct?” The Greek work\\xa0credo,\\xa0\"I believe,\" is more accurately translated as \"I give my heart to\" or \"I trust in.\" \\xa0What is Jesus asking Nicodemus to give his heart to, to trust in? \\xa0A ticket to heaven?   But “eternal life” is always connected to Jesus’ promise that he has come to bring “life, and life abundantly” in the present.  It’s all about a deeper living, a fuller connection with God in this moment, a wider sense of relationship with and responsibility for other humans and creation.\\t\\t\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what happened to Nicodemus as he left Jesus that night.  But something must have started to work in Nicodemus, something began to “re-wire” inside of him and he perceived something anew.  Because later, when the chief priests and Pharisees want to have Jesus arrested, Nicodemus takes the personal risk of insisting that Jesus have a hearing before them first.   And perhaps most significant, it will be Nicodemus who joins Joseph of Arimathea to remove Jesus body from the cross after he is executed.   As the crowds disperse on that sad and awful late Good Friday afternoon, Nicodemus will bring over 100 pounds of spices with which to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.\\t\\n\\tWe don’t just want theological information; we yearn for a way in, to perceive God’s reign among us in a way that helps us be reborn and made new, again and again.  Only this perception shift will help us take the risks of renewing trust as a congregation, to risk of choosing and working with new clergy leadership.  Jesus waits for us in the quiet shadows of our hearts, ready to listen and to guide us.  May we meet him there.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'Since ancient times, the presence of water in the desert means life and its absence spells suffering and death.  Hard to imagine, here in the land of 10,000 lakes, humid summers, and abundant lush foliage.  But the water-imagery used by desert-dwelling prophets like Amos and Jesus speak to us of an essential divine flow on the periphery of our day-to-day consciousness.  They give us a unique perspective about things that are hard to articulate: God’s ways among humans that can be unexpected, and our part in these life-giving interactions.  \\nThe Book of Amos speaks of waters and ever-flowing streams, but in a way that is stomach-churning to read.  The 8th century BCE Jewish prophet’s writings are filled with vivid and brutal depictions of God’s coming judgment on the northern kingdom of Israel during that prosperous era.  In this Amos passage, the prophet is so appalled by his wealthy nation’s religious pomposity and their disregard of their poor and needy, that he claims that God is actually sickened by their worship.  Speaking with God’s voice to those in power, Amos doesn’t mince words about God’s relentless judgment that will befall the people. Those with power and wealth have cheated the poor and trampled on the needy in their midst.  Any generosity seems to come intermittently; it doesn’t move continuously like living water, like ever-flowing streams of social justice.   Amos pulls his readers attention back from wonderings about how everything will pan-out in the end, “the day of the Lord,” to their present day reluctance to be channels of God’s justice and righteousness.   We might ask ourselves if our attempt to challenge economic and educational inequities amounts an intermittent dribble…or does it flow like an ever-flowing stream?   \\t \\nToday’s passage from the Gospel of John finds Jesus in Jerusalem, a city which had to make repeated and complicated efforts to maintain a fresh water supply for its people.  During the time of the great Temple in Jerusalem, the religious and ritual center for the people, Jews would make a pilgrimage to the great metropolis.  Jesus and his followers have traveled there for the Feast of Tabernacles, what was also known as the Festival of Booths or Succoth. This harvest celebration had become identified with the wilderness journey after the Israelites escaped from Egypt.  It continues to be celebrated by Jews around the world, today, falling after Yom Kippur during their High Holy Days each fall.  \\nDuring this particular festival, people would build hut-like structures, or booths, throughout the city streets, symbolic of those used by the Israelites in the wilderness.  People would eat and often sleep in them for week in remembrance of their sojourn through the wilderness. Near the end of Succoth, the Festival of Booths, the priests would go to the Pool of Siloam, which was a freshwater reservoir that supplied the city water.  Accompanied by musicians and dancers, the priests would draw water and, returning through the Water Gate of the city, they would then pour the water over the Temple altar.  Libation and a sign of God’s graciousness in a dry land.\\nIt is in this context that Jesus makes this rather startling self-proclamation we hear in John’s Gospel.  Perhaps Jesus was watching this procession of priests carrying the water back to the Temple.  Suddenly, Jesus announces: “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in me drink.”  Jesus is claiming that he himself manifests, incarnates, all the blessings in their tradition which relate to water:  miraculous outdoor springs that save the people from death, the symbolic flow of mercy and justice like an ever-flowing stream, inner springs that are the movement of God in one’s personal depths, an ever-renewed and mysterious upwelling of full life within us.  Who IS this presumptuous person?\\nJesus wanted people to understand that God’s power is always accessible to us, like the rush of living water that seems to come out of nowhere.  For Jesus, and for the prophets, this power is never a personalized spirituality, something we experience and do alone.  There is something about God’s flow of power that is always communal; is it connected to the well-being of the whole community, the entire society.  We may step into this life-giving flow in the privacy of our own prayers and meditation, but the on-going flow of God’s renewing love and transforming power is always bigger, and more inclusive than our private experience. \\nPerhaps water can become a daily touchstone for us, reminding and reinforcing what we ponder in our hearts:  That we are invited into this flow of transformation, compassion and generosity.  “Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water,” said Jesus. And so may it be for each of us.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have two important but rather bewildering scripture stories presented at length today.  I’m hoping you will read both of them at some point, but I’ll offer a brief synopisis in my message rather than reading them right now.\\n\\tStory #1 – from the Hebrew scriptures – Ezekial 37:1-14 describes a wild dream the prophet Ezekial has one night.  He lives hundreds of years before Jesus, in a time when the nation of Israel was overrun and much of the Jewish population was taken into exile in Babylon.  Their temple in Jerusalem destroyed – great uncertainty - how would their sacred buildings, their culture, their lives ever be rebuilt?  Ezekial sees a vision of a valley of dry bones, that slowly start to rattle, then gain new tissue and skin and finally stand.   And God says to Ezekial, you go tell your people:  “I will bring you up out of your graves…put my spirit, my breath, within you and you shall live.” \\n\\tStory #2 is from the New Testament, and it too is a startling story!  It follows this same theme of death to new life.  And this is where I will focus my message, John chapter 11:1-45:  \\n\\tIn this passage, John describes Jesus’ final miracle or sign as occurring within a few miles of the huge metropolis of Jerusalem. A confusing scene unfolds before us:  close friends of Jesus urgently ask for his help.  When Jesus hears the news that Lazarus has sick he says “This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”  Wow.  Tell that to his frantic, grieving sisters.  Is this a twisted version of the simplistic and hurtful platitude: God is going to use your suffering for a greater good” - ?   I, for one, am not willing to embrace a notion of such a cruelly manipulative God.  But Jesus oddly focuses elsewhere for two days and his friend Lazarus dies.  Jesus weeps at this news.  There are angry accusations from Jesus’ close women friends, Mary and Martha, sisters of the dead man.  The Gospel writer includes theological proclamations about his being the Messiah and Son of God, there is more intense anguish and grief, and finally a dramatic act of healing.  First Lazarus is dead; then Lazarus is resusitated.   \\n\\tIn the middle of our current pandemic, we might simply dismiss this story, ……especially when it is lifted up as a tale with a happy ending.  See!  This Jesus is really amazing!  He must be divine – he brings the dead back to life!  And Jesus does that for us too!  Just believe!   We might toss the story off as another fanciful tale, in part because we are fact-focused post-Enlightenment people, who live in a world of measureable evidence and verifiable fact.  A dead person is made alive again.  Right.  \\n\\tI can sense that temptation to cynicism and avoidance when it comes to this story within myself.  I am reminded of how these attitudes can sometimes stifle my energy and my openness to new information from God.  A cynical hopelessness can creep up on me, especially when I’m feeling despairing, as I’m sure Mary and Martha were.  The enormity of the healing work and economic devastation in front of us in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic can leave us feeling scattered and de-energized.  Cynicism and avoidance can bring numbing quiet to the tumult in my head and heart.  But a larger part of me does not want to stay there.  I want to believe that in the midst of uncertainty, a new future, a new life, is emerging, being born among us.  But how? \\nJesus was one of many voices calling for reform and economic justice, in a time when religious and wealthy lay leaders were drawing benefits from living under the imperial domination system of the Romans.  Jesus knows that Jewish peasants who previously made a living off their land, growing their own fruits, grains and vegetables, now are now forced to grow luxury crops of figs, dates and olives for export.  The products are heavily taxed, and don’t feed their families; the profits benefit the wealthy.  Others are forced off their ancestral lands.  His criticism of those complicit Jewish leaders is biting. He is already spreading a message that some forms of communal interaction and governance must die, so something else can be resurrected and live.  And ironically, heading towards Jerusalem is leading him to his own death.  When Jesus arrives at Lazarus, Martha and Mary’s house, it’s not surprising he used this language: I am the resurrection and the life.  But what does this mean?\\n\\tArcheologists and historians have recently discovered that the town of Bethany, just a few miles outside of Jerusalem, was some kind of site for the care of the sick.  There seems to have been some kind of poor house for the destitute, a leper colony and a hospice for the dying. (wiki)  So, in addition to poverty, people in this region lived with and knew suffering deeply. I do know that it has been among such suffering communities that I have at times found the most hopefulness, and ironically, the most new life.   I have encountered people who were dying, who seemed radiant with love, with forgiveness, hopefulness, with life at its fullest.   We hear miraculous stories of people who endanger themselves as they reach out to help others, even now in our overwhelmed healthcare system.  We’ve heard of communities who forgive in the midst of atrocity.  Oddly enough, the openness, courage of these people, and forgiveness of these communities, serves to resuscitate them and bring them new life.\\n\\t. These are resurrection stories, and when I start to really pay attention, I realize they are all around me.  And I think these stories are unsettling because they challenge me to look at places where I would rather cling to the death of stuckness, fear, anxiety.  When I am overwhelmed by the present reality and  yearn stay in that dark cave, entombed like Lazrus.   Where I just don’t have to think or deal with any of this mess.  But these are the ways of death, and Jesus knew it well.  \\n\\tWas Lazarus really dead or just taking a nap?  Was he totally dead and brought back to life just by hearing Jesus’ voice?  I am not totally sure. But I find deep truth in this story.  Something in me resonates when I hear Jesus bellow loudly: “Lazarus, come out!”  There are places that I am enclosed in the dark, and sometimes it seems safe and even comfortable.  But the Spirit of the Risen Jesus is persistent:  “Anne, come out!  Resurrection is not something that happens in the future; it is a present reality…..let me draw you into it!  And this is what is might look like and this is how I want you to help me make it happen!”  Where does new life need to happen for you today?  Where is the energy and hope blocked within each of us?  Throughout our lives we are invited to be resurrection stories, and this is one of those times.  The Spirit of the Risen Jesus is calling us out of our places of fear and despair, darkness and death.  How might we respond to that call to “come out?”   Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'In the early church, Lent was a time to prepare catechumens, adults who had chosen to follow the Jesus Way, for baptism.  Practices of prayer, fasting, scripture reading, almsgiving to the poor were integral to this preparation time. Some modern Protestant congregations shy away from Lenten practices, hoping to avoid unnecessary gloominess, when we ache for spring sunshine and color. But in a world that entices us to multi-task more efficiently, cram more into our families schedules, work harder, continue to acquire and manage more belongings, there is something precious about a time-set-apart for introspection. A time to reflect honestly look on our priorities.  A time to acknowledge the things we wish we hadn’t done and the things we have neglected to do.  Mistakes and limitations.  Not to shame us and make us feel like we are bad, but some good old-fashioned guilt perhaps, about what we want to change about ourselves.  Lent presses upon us the theological language of confession, repentance, forgiveness.  The call to obedience – now there’s a word that grates on many of us – and transformation.  A time to recognize our deeper hunger to experience God in addition to just thinking about God.  I need to be reminded that it is in the very messiness of my life, the imperfectness of who I am and what I do, that God both meets and blesses me. \\nBoth of today’s scripture readings include dramatic interaction between humans, the forces of evil and God.  The Genesis story offers this mythological tale of the first humans, Adam and Eve, complete with talking animals and a mystical garden.  The humans are confronted with the temptation to be more than human and to embrace God-like powers of certain knowledge and immortality.  There is a lot that this story is not about.  Briefly stated: This ancient Jewish story from 10th century BCE is not a scientific description of the how humans appeared on earth.  Nor is it intended as a condemnation of women (that comes later in church history – think “justification for persecuting witches – 15th century CE).  The serpent is not the devil; personification of evil comes much later in Biblical writings, influenced by Persian religion, Zoroastrianism.  Probably most importantly is not about original sin either – a flawed nature we all inherit because of A and E’s disobedience.   Biblical commentators have noted that the first time Hebrew scriptures mention “sin” is later, when Cain kills Abel.  Perhaps our “original sin” is retaliatory violence that attacks creation’s well-being? (Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki).  \\nSo what to make of this story – that has wrecked such havoc in it’s misinterpretations??!!  It is a foundational mythological tale that attempts to explain our present condition of human life, in all its messiness and brokenness.  A life where we often pretend we are God-like as we overreach our limits and then we blame others.  It reminds me of how I loose my sense of precious creatureliness.  We forget we are created in God’s image: we become ashamed and fearful, we hide from God and become estranged from each other.  Good stuff to consider in Lent. \\nThe Matthew story describes Jesus being tempted in much the same way.  We have no idea if this was a literal encounter with some personalized face of evil, or an equally harrowing vocational struggle within Jesus own psyche.   His public ministry of teaching and healing has not started yet.  Following his baptism by John the Baptism, he heads to the wilderness on what could be described as a vision quest.  What is this urgency within me?  This sense of God calling me to do…what?  Engaging the time-honored spiritual practice of fasting, honing his spiritual attentiveness, he confronts – what – his shadow side?  Hallucinations?  Matthew calls it “the devil” – which means basically “adversary” in this context.  Forget the little red guy with horns, hoofs and a pitchfork, or medieval visions of Dante’s “Inferno.”  Think poetic language to describe great truth!  In this encounter, Jesus is invited, beguiled, to take on impressive powers that are admired and celebrated in the human kingdoms of the world.  These promised powers will make him great in humans eyes, maybe even spread his message further!   \\nBut yielding to these temptations will ultimately run contrary to his purpose.  He is to be the one who preaches the “alternative community,” or the radical reversal of assumptions about status and power in God’s Kingdom.  A reign marked by Self-sacrifice, vulnerability, humility.   This is an important text to keep in mind as we hear current leaders calling for increased status and power for our nation. \\n\\tThe adversary, pushes Jesus to face the implications of the words from God at his baptism:  “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”  “If you are the Son of God,” taunts the adversary, “how about this?”   We do well to remember that first century hearers of this story would not immediately associate the title “Son of God” with meaning Jesus was divine.  “Son of God” was a honorary title well known in Judaism:  Kings in the Davidic line during Israel’s golden age were called “Sons of God” and the people of Israel are sometimes themselves called “Sons (and daughters!) of God.”  But maybe most importantly, in the first century Greco-Roman world,  “Son of God” was an honorary title for the Roman Emperors.  For the Caesars who lived extravagant lifestyles, often frequenting their lavish seaside villas.  They weilded the power of a huge army, an enormous treasurery and ruled with an iron fist.  “If you are the Son of God,” the adversary says, “if you are going to be high and mighty like the Caesars”…. snears the adversary. “Hey, What kind of Son of God are you, really?”  \\n\\tThe tests that follow are tempting because they challenge Jesus to get really clear about what he is called to do and not do in his ministry.  And the tests are confusingly tempting because they contain partial truths:  “Come on Jesus, I know you are going to be concerned about the needy and the hungry!  Let’s get started here, by turning these stones into bread.  No?  Okay….God’s reign of justice and peace is a real challenge to earthly corrupt powers.  Don’t you want to have dominion over the kingdoms of the earth so you can get this Kingdom of God thing moving in the right direction?!”   Finally, the adversary turns to quoting promises from the Hebrew book of Psalms:  God’s protection is promised to the righteous who call on God’s name!  In an ironic twist, the adversary suggests Jesus test this promise in the center of Israel’s holy city, Jerusalem, a top the sacred Temple.   So Jesus, you certainly are righteous; how about you just fling yourself off this Temple balcony?  Go ahead, lean into those promises of the ever gracious and saving God!  Go ahead Jesus, test God!”  \\nThe question before us during Lent is always:  who is this Jesus?  What kind of Son of God is this?  He is the one who will not live with half-truth; he will not portray God as a magic trick waiting to fulfill our every desire.  We watch Jesus struggle with understanding his call, his vocation as God’s Son.  The consequences of his choices will be enormous.  His teaching and healing will invite many into God’s saving grace, and he will incur the wrath of public authorities.  On this first Sunday in Lent, we might well wonder to ourselves:  what would it mean for me to more fully live into God’s will for me, God’s will for our church, God’s will for our nation?  What full truth about ourselves are we each being asked to face this day?  Such are the questions of the Lenten season.  Thanks be to God. Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tIf you and I had been in the synagogue in Capernaum, at that Friday evening Sabbath worship and study time, we may have already noticed this possessed man in the crowd.  And it would not be because his head was spinning, as Hollywood films would have us believe.  No, it would because we already knew him and had observed his behavior through the years.  Was he mentally ill, speaking and acting strangely because of brain chemistry, and thus was hearing and seeing things that no one else did?  Had he sustained a brain injury?  Or did he convulse with epilepsy?  But these are 21st century considerations.  As 1st century people, you and I would be living in a pre-scientific culture that did not understand the medical view of how brains got mis-wired or injured, or how bodies got sick in general.  We would have a sense that people could get possessed by things that just weren’t right.  And since the spirit world of things unseen was as natural to us as the air we breathe, we might assume this was an evil spirit.   Or, we might attribute his bizarre behavior to a personal trauma or loss….one we knew about in our tight community.  What we would know for sure is that this guy did not belong among us.  He was unpredictable, a “loose cannon” who did not belong in this holy place of our synagogue, in the gathered congregation.  He would be considered ritually impure and unclean.  We would see his vileness, whatever it was, as first of all an affront to God and secondarily, a danger to us as a community. \\n\\n\\tAs I studied this story this week, I began thinking about the limits of my own tolerance when it comes to living in community, when it comes to worshipping together.  Who am I comfortable living next door to?  Would I be comfortable sharing a pew with someone like this man? \\n\\n\\tRoy Oswald is a long-time minister and author who works with churches that are hoping to grow in numbers and vitality.  He asks them to think about how they might be more welcoming of newcomers.  He says each church has some unspoken “parish norms” when it comes to the question of “who is really welcome here?”  Of course most congregations tell him: “well, everyone is welcome here, of course!”  But Oswald then invites them to do an experiment: “... next time you are in a shopping mall,” he suggests, “sit down for 10 minutes and watch people walk by.  As you note specific individuals coming toward you, make a subjective judgment: Would this person receive a warm welcome in our church?”  Oswald suggests that we “might be surprised at the number of people you identify as being less than welcome.” (Roy Oswald Making Your Church More Inviting, p. 49).\\n\\tJewish purity laws of the first century dictated that people with physical or mental illnesses were not welcome in the synagogue, nor were they to commune closely with other Jews who wanted to stay ritually pure.  People who were sick or appeared mentally disturbed were believed to have sinned or were possessed by evil.  They not only had to deal with their problem, but they were outcast from their society.  Considered unclean, unholy, and deemed separate from the rest of the community so the community could stay holy and intact before God.  Are we in the 21st century more sophisticated than this?  We might remember our nation’s initial and ongoing response to people with AIDS, our discomfort around someone who is differently-abled than us, or someone whose ill-health is physically obvious.  Without theories about germs, congenital defects, addiction and all the other things we know today about ill health, first century people looked to different causes for the problem.  For the most part, they viewed sickness and deformity as caused either by personal sin, or by an evil spirit or demon who had taken up residence in your body.    \\n\\t\\n\\tInto this mix of cultural assumptions and religious traditions, appears Jesus.  Throughout his public ministry, it will be his custom to read the Hebrew scriptures and speak in local synagogues, which was not unusual for itinerant teachers at the time.   But his manner of speaking, and his interaction with the disruptive man with an “evil spirit,” so astounds the other worshippers that a new type of teaching and teacher will emerge.   Strangely, it is the unclean spirit who recognizes Jesus for who he is: “what have you to do with us; have you come to destroy us?” (i.e., me and all the other unclean spirits).   For those steeped in the Jewish tradition, it was well known that when the Kingdom of God comes upon earth, evil will be confronted and overpowered.  “I know who you are,” continues the unclean spirit, “the Holy One of God!”   \\n\\t\\n\\tExorcists and healers were common in first century, but they used magical incantations and elaborate rituals to confront spiritual evil.  Jesus simply bellows, “muzzle yourself, and come out of him!”  Everyone is amazed, meaning literally that they did not comprehend what they had experienced.  Apparently, it is Jesus’ words themselves that bring in God’s reign of power over evil.  Not only that, but in a society that dehumanized sick and possessed people, this man has now being restored to his community.  Interesting question: which is more disruptive and shocking to us?  Someone gets healed, or are we more surprised by that some marginalized and scorned outsider being brought back into community?  I wonder….who has been marginalized and scorned among us in our families, in our workplaces, in our congregation, who might need to be welcomed back?\\n\\t\\n\\tAll this can be unsettling.  “What is this?” those assembled in the synagogue cry out.  “A new teaching – with authority!”  Which is odd, because this isn’t new; this is old stuff.  The Hebrew prophets have told the community again and again that God’s “new thing” will “erupt out of old tradition and expectation.” (Kate Huey, UCC lectionary webpage for Epiphany 4B).   But the first century scribes drew their authority from their erudite command of language and their knowledge of different rabbinic scholars’ commentaries about different texts.  In this scene, Jesus’ authority has a brash, independent streak.  It also calls people back to the essence of their tradition.  Jesus’ action reminded people of God their Creator, the One who spoke into the void and made the universe.  When Jesus speaks, something happens!   And, that something, in Jesus’ case, is usually going to be disruptive to the status quo.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWhere do we experience this kind of authority today?  Our Deuteronomy passage tells of how God will raise up prophetic voices that will challenge people with God’s justice and mercy.   And prophets’ voices throughout Israel’s history continually disrupted the complacency and evil deeds of both leaders and the Jewish community.  The prophets’ message was consistent:  You are mistreating the poor; you are worshipping idols; you are not embodying God’s ways of love and compassion; you have left God.  We might wonder together, whom does God speak through today?  Perhaps a better way to ask this question is:  Who speaks, and in speaking seems to disrupt the status quo?  Prophetic voices in our distant past in our nation called for the abolition of slavery; they were perceived as disrupting God-assigned roles of master and slave.  Today, prophetic voices in both government and many faith communities call us to affirm marriage equality for straight and gay people alike, to re-examine our approach to immigration, to face up to the scientific facts of climate change and environmental degradation.  And some people still find these ideas disruptive to all they hold dear.  \\n\\t\\n\\tWe will be reading through the Gospel of Mark from now until the end of November.  We will encounter repeated instances of Jesus prophetic teaching and healing.  His words and being will restore people not only to physical and mental wholeness, but he will also be restoring them to community.  And these actions will be perceived as a wondrously miraculous by some, and as tremendously disruptive and problematic by others.\\n\\t\\n\\tI suggest we pay close attention to Jesus’ new and, yes, disruptive, teaching at this point in our interim period together.  As you can read in today’s bulletin, the Discovery Team is asking you to join them next Sunday morning for an honest look at some of your history together.  To speak openly about both joys and disappointments in your experience here may sound potentially disruptive.  Yet I have found that such openhearted sharing, in a small group where there is no debate or discussion about other people’s experiences, can begin to disrupt negative interactions in a congregation.   As we give our presence and attention to one another, we begin to rebuild trust and hope in our life together as the Church.  I hope you will join us next Sunday, as all voices need to be heard.\\n\\t\\n\\tWe will need to re-immerse ourselves in Jesus’ “new teaching” in the days ahead.  It is guaranteed to both disrupt and to guide us.  I am grateful for, and I am dependent on, Jesus’ living presence among us in this process.  Together, may we be instructed, disrupted and comforted by his loving authority.   Amen.\\t \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'I have often thought of the Sunday after Easter as the big “Now What?” in the Christian Church.  Jesus has risen from the dead, we boldly proclaimed last week!  And even with our diverse perspectives on resurrection, we found ourselves affiriming a common thread of new life, renewed spiritual energy.  Yet, as I look around this week, humanity does not seem very resurrected.  I think our increasingly ability to instantly picture and hear about all conflict and upheaval brings a increasing sense that we all are teetering on the brink darkness and despair.  And whatever our cynicism level about peace processes, I don’t think any of us like to hear of them collapsing…..the mid-east peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is suspended again.   One can argue about who did the egregious thing (again) first.  But I find this current ending a sad irony as Yom Hashoah begins at sundown tonight.  The annual Holocaust Remembrance Day, when communities around the world remember the 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust between 1933-1945.  \\nSo, the “now what” after Easter finds us in a sobering context on this beautiful spring day.  We are reminded of this essential paradox of the Easter message:  Christ has risen and where is “new life” as the world continues to struggle with evil and human violence?\\nThe Gospel text for today suggests that, after discovering the empty tomb, the disciples of Jesus have basically gone back into hiding.  Perhaps this is our first clue about the paradoxical nature of “new life.”  We can receive startlingly good news, and have little idea how it might change our lives.  At this point in the narrative, it is the “evening on that day,” meaning the night after the day Mary Magdalene, and probably some other women and several male disciples found the empty tomb. The Jewish leaders of the time maintained a fragile peace with the occupying Roman legions. Now, Jesus’ disciples are worried that the religious authorities will come after them too, as them have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.   Most Biblical scholars see this phrase “doors locked for fear of the Jews” in John’s Gospel does not describe Jesus relation with his own Jewish tradition. Hostility towards the Jews of Jesus time in John’s Gospel is a reflection of the later first century tension between John’s Hellenistic gentile Christian community and the local synagogues.  As Christianity later becomes the official religion of the Empire in the 4th century, the tension will grow into the ancient and deadly lie about “Christ-killers” and eventual persecution of Jews by Christians.  \\nApproaching Holocaust Remembrance Day, we do well to remember the longstanding anti-Semitism fueled by the Christian Church through the ages that provided a mindset in which the killing of 6 million Jews was even possible.   Even with the current complexities of the middle east peace process, and long-standing trauma caused by both sides of the conflict, the pernicious hatred fueling anti-Semitism continues to spread.  Around the world, and even in supposedly safe and civil places like a Jewish Community Center in Kansas.\\tWe can surmise that Jesus’ followers were worried about being caught up in the dragnet that took Jesus.  But I wonder if they also had a gnawing sense that they betrayed their friend.  They were unable to stop Jesus’ arrest or his murder, and at least one of them denied even knowing him.  The remorse and shame seems to have immobilized them.  I suspect many of us have known this kind of frozen, locked-in place in our own lives.  The disciples’ abandoning of Jesus was probably was all they could think of as they remembered him.\\nBut that evening, as they sit together behind locked doors, sharing food they cannot taste and conversation that heightens their despair, a stranger appears before them.  “Peace be with you,” says the stranger, a conventional greeting.   These words might have reminded Jesus’ followers of his promised gift of peace he discussed at the Last Supper.  But no, they really don’t have a clue and remain astonished and confused.   Rowan Williams’ the former Anglican Archbishop of Cantebury writes his book Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel, that the disciples do not recognize this stranger as Jesus until he shows them the wounds in his hands and side.  They are in hiding, feeling anxious, victimized, wounded by grief themselves, locked in their own pain. But then they see Jesus’ wounds.  \\nThis is significant change of perspective, says Williams.   We ourselves may identify with Jesus’ sufferings on the cross and are “consoled at the thought of God sharing in our suffering” through Jesus sufferings (p. 69).  However, “it is precisely when Christ’s sufferings and mine are brought intimately together that the image of the crucified is indeed in danger of degradation,” Williams continues.  What he is suggesting is that, If we don’t be careful, we can loose track of the real suffering of others.  “We (may) experience ourselves as sufferers, as victims,” continues Williams, “and so experience Christ’s cross as the symbol of who and what we are.  Jesus as victim (becomes) the image of myself as victim” (p. 69-70).\\nThe problem with this line of identification, says Williams, is that it can quickly lead to us thinking, “my suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.” This happens in our personal relationships, in congregations, and it happens across ethnic groups, different religions and nations.  “My suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.”  This attitude can lead to another more problematic stance, notes Williams, where “nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.”  This can grind any peace process to a halt. “Nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.” \\nHaven’t we witnessed this kind of rhetoric is creeping into public dialogue about what is wrong with the United States and how these problems should be necessarily solved?   How do we as Christians confront this kind of smug, twisted and seemingly impermeable logic?  What kind of dialogue might be possible that engages these kinds of absolutes, demonizes any other point of view and even suggests violent tactics? \\nThe disciples encounter the Risen Jesus and are faced with the fact of their lack of innocence.  They are confronted with their own culpability, their own passive participation in the violence that caused his death.  And they are faced with someone they don’t initially recognize, so caught up they are in their past actions and inactions, their sense of suffering and hopelessness.  “Easter,” says Rowan Williams, “means coming to the memory of Jesus, looking for consolation, and finding a memory that hurts and judges, that sets a distance, even an alienation between me and hope, my Savior.  Easter occurs, again and again, in this open-up of a void, the sense of absence which questions our egocentric aspirations and our longing for ‘tidy drama’; it occurs when we find in Jesus not a dead friend but a living stranger.” (p. 74)\\nAnd surprisingly, the stranger, the one we now recognize as the Risen Lord, again says:  “Peace be with you.  As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  Williams say Jesus is calling the disciples out of their  “armor of presumed innocence.”  So much is happening so quickly for his friends and followers.  He is not angry with them; he approaches them with a steady openness and compassionate words.  He breathes on them; for the Gospel of John, this is Pentecost, the coming of the promised Holy Spirit, the Comforter.  Slowly it dawns on the people in the room, men and women alike, that Jesus has forgiven them.  He holds no grudge or resentment about their passive betrayal of him.  There, in his presence, they are not just remembering their dead friend but are now experiencing a living person.  One who is not quite the one they knew; he is yet a stranger.  He speaks again:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”  Would this be making any sense if they themselves were not experiencing Jesus’ love and forgiveness of their sorry selves, right in that moment?  \\nThe author of I Peter will later write to young churches throughout Asia Minor saying: God has given us “new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”  As the Church, we do not just form an institution to perpetuate the memory of a first century holy man’s deeds and words.  We are the community in Jesus name, who like the early disciples, find ourselves approached and forgiven by the presence of our Risen Lord.  We are a body of people who witness to this reality, and are a safe place where others can come to meet the Risen Lord, again and again. \\nHere is the “now what?” after Easter: Jesus is calling us out of ourselves, of our past, into his future where the Risen Jesus is already ahead of us.  Calling us to keep reaching out into the world, out of our own experience of forgiveness and renewal.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.   \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Before I attended seminary in my early twenties, I had little idea of what Lent was really about, or why I, as a Protestant, should care one way or the other.   At that point in my life, Lent was a strange, gloomy season before Easter celebrated by Catholics.  I would remember childhood friends unexpectedly showing up at school with ashy smudges on their foreheads.  They would speak in hushed tones about going to confession and what they were “giving up” for Lent.  Over at my house of low-church Congregationalists, all eyes were happily on Easter!  My sister and I eagerly anticipated new spring dresses, savoring chocolate rabbits and hunting for cheery, colored eggs.   Lent, those five weeks before Easter, retained a dour and funeral-like atmosphere to me that was best avoided.  \\n\\nBut in seminary, I happened to fall into a crowd of brainy and irreverent Lutherans.  They, along with some equally out-spoken and bourbon-drinking southern Episcopal students, provided me with my first introduction to the rich cycle of the Christian church’s liturgical seasons.  From their leadership in student chapel services and in our late-night theological debates, I learned about the reflective and penitential “purple times” of Advent and Lent.  Of the value of a time-set-apart, of the power of silence and contemplative prayer, and of my own need for self-reflection.  I even began to sort through this idea of repentance.  In Lenten practices of receiving ashes, self-examination, confession, reflective scripture study, I began to recognize my deeper hunger to experience God.  It was no longer enough for me to just think about God in theology classes.  This somber season of Lent appeared to be a way into a deeper perception of God and God’s actions around me, if I gave it my time, my attention and willing intent. \\n\\nEarlier this month, our Worship Ministry Team and I talked together about possibilities for worship and reflection during Lent this year.  We recognized that our recent History Sunday of sharing specific memories about this church’s past, had stirred-up a mix of both grateful and painful feelings among those who participated.  Now what?  How will this congregation not stay stuck in in the negative memories and painful feelings?  We don’t forget the past.   But what would it be like if each person in this church system faced his or her role, whether it was through words or silence, actions or inaction…. and truly repented?  \\n\\nOur rational, linear thinking brains may not perceive this to be a good or safe idea.  It seldom seems like a good idea to acknowledge one’s own mistakes, weaknesses or sins.  It occurred to the Worship Team and me that we may need to explore a different perspective on what we perceive we have experienced around here.  That different perception comes not from the brain, but from what the ancients called “the primary organ of spiritual perception,” or, the heart.   Around the world, and across religious traditions, the heart was understood to possess a different way of perceiving.  This manner of perceiving is accessed almost side-ways, intuitively, through symbols, metaphors, music, silence, visual art, time in nature.  “May the eyes of your heart be opened” wrote St. Paul.  Somehow the heart, if we can access its depths, organizes the information field of life differently; it doesn’t divide life only into good/bad, right/wrong.  The Worship Team and I sighed as we considered the way forward for this congregation: perhaps this Lent can be a journey deeper into our hearts, and the heart of God’s mercy and love.\\n\\nThe season of Lent always begins with a description of Jesus’ temptations in the wilderness, immediately following his baptism in the Jordan River by John the Baptist.  This story about Jesus shows up in three of the four Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life, in the New Testament, but Mark’s (what we just heard) is the shortest.  Almost frustratingly so, if you have read the accounts found in Luke and Matthew.  Mark’s Gospel condensed and to the point….to the point of not telling us in what ways Jesus is tempted!  Matthew and Luke go into considerable detail about “the evil one” slyly inviting Jesus to feed the masses, and himself, by turning rocks into bread.  And then challenges Jesus with “if you really are the Son of God, go ahead and throw yourself off this temple spire, so God’s saving power can be revealed!”  Then final dig, “so, I hear you are proclaiming God’s reign on earth….here let me make it easier for you…here’s all the kingdoms to come….take on some impressive powers; you and I can rule together and get this God’s reign stuff started!”  Each temptation has a bit of good in it:  the chance to feed hungry people, a way to show God’s power, the possibility ushering in God’s reign.  In Matthew and Luke’s accounts of this story, Jesus is kept busy and we get it.  Temptation is tough because it always has a bit of truth in it.  But they are partial truths and not enough to make them right.\\n\\nBut Mark?  Mark mentions none of these specific temptations.  Mark’s account is briefly introduced by these tender words by God at Jesus’ baptism: “You are my Son, the Beloved.”  Beloved; God is well pleased.  These are words of the heart, echoing a deep theme in scripture that God, Godself, somehow has a “heart.”  But Mark doesn’t linger at the river scene.  “Immediately,” the Spirit drives Jesus into the wilderness….he’s there 40 days….Satan (whoever that is supposed to be) tempts him….he is hanging out with wild animals and angels.  Period.  No mention of the three specific ways Jesus is tempted.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhat do we have here?  Jesus is led by the Spirit into a barren wilderness, the historical place of Hebrew encounters with God.  Centuries earlier, the Jewish people escaped from slavery in Egypt and wandered for forty years in the wilderness, learning to what it means to live in covenant with God.  I sometimes think that interim times between pastors are wilderness times for a congregation, where life is unpredictable and uncertain.  We are wandering around trying to discover what it means to be in covenant with God in this time and place.  Jesus is alone in the wilderness, presumably fasting and praying, most likely trying to figure out what his own covenant with God is about.  What does this identity of Sonship means for him? What is God calling him to do next?  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe one called “Satan” or “the tempter” or the “evil one” appears. Was it a struggle in Jesus’ head or was he actually approached by a visible, talking figure?  Mark only says he was “tempted by” this manifestation of evil.   But in what way?  Mark tells us that the Spirit has descended like a dove not just on Jesus, but into him.  And this same Spirit “drives” him into the wilderness.  The word actually means “expels, thrusts” him into the wilderness, with the same Spirit still within him.  But why no temptations listed?  Karoline Lewis, a preaching professor over at our local Luther Seminary writes that Jesus enters the wilderness with “with no strategies, no fighting skills.”  Jesus has only this:  God is present in him   And maybe, Lewis suggests, Mark wants us to know that Jesus greatest temptation is “to think that God is not present….to believe that God has given up on him or withdrawn from him.”  (http://www.workingpreacher.org/craft.aspx?post=3537).  \\n\\t\\n\\tI can relate to this temptation.  It is very natural, and tempting because it is so easy to assume I run my life under my own power.  And this may be a temptation for congregations, oddly enough.  We focus more on the human institution of church, than we do on the movement of God among us.  The humans here, and the church building, are all so much more visible and concrete.  And it can get unpredictable and a little weird if people start talking too much about the Spirit doing this and that in their lives!  And if things go wrong with an institution we want to figure out which humans did something wrong, we want to blame and we want to fix it, now!  We get caught up in wrong and right, who did what when, rehashing, if-only, on and on.  It is very tempting to assume God doesn’t have much to do with all this.  Why?  Because God is going to ask us each to take a good hard look at our own part.  God is going to challenge us to perceive things in a different way; to engage each other at a heart, not just a head, level.  “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news,” said Jesus.\\n\\nLent is meant to be a disquieting time, unpredictable, mysterious.  It’s like a wilderness time, with uncharted maze-like paths and tests and temptations.  If we let it have its way with us, Lent can lead us into deeper ways of perceiving reality and responding to God’s presence. It can lead us to better understanding our own part in the wider system of a congregation.  And so we journey together, deeper into our own hearts and the heart of God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tWe are faced with some challenging texts this morning:  Through the prophet Jeremiah, we hear God threatening destruction of ancient Israel.  Through the gospel of Luke, we hear Jesus telling his followers they must hate their family.  Easy to be dismissive of these ancient texts, in part because they raise our hackles.  Perhaps they confirm our worst suspicions about a judgemental and punishing God.  About the irrelevancy of scripture in our modern day.  Perhaps we should all be down at Radio Waves this morning!    \\nBut I have learned through the years that when a Biblical texts irk or offend me, it is wise to pause, dig deeper and pay attention.  Let’s move into these troublesome passages, starting with Jeremiah’s vision of God as a potter.  Perhaps you have stepped into a potter’s studio and watched an artist creating pots from clay.  After observing for a while, you might wonder about this vision from Jeremiah that we are held “in God’s hands.”  How does this fit into your own image of who God is and how God interacts with us?  Picture yourself as a mound of clay.  You are repeatedly worked, pounded, even slammed on the worktable, so pesky air bubbles are removed from your bulk.  Then water is worked into you; too much and you turn to mud, too little and you crumble.  All this before you are pressed hard and tight into the center of the potter’s wheel, as it starts to spin with dizzying speed.  Pushed and pulled, you are turned inside out into unimaginable shapes, and then fired in a very hot oven.\\nLife seems that way sometimes.  In our personal lives, in our lives together as a church, sometimes we feel really worked over, subjected to the hot fire of immense and often unexpected challenges.  The weather brings droughts, fires or hurricanes; accidents or sudden illness seem to slam and pound us.  Ongoing dramas of problematic relationships, work that wears us out or grinding unemployment, all hold us tight and press us down.   We feel helpless in face of the cruelty or the miss-use of power by those in positions of authority.  Our own mistakes, our own sins, overwhelm us.  Does God actually send all these trials?  Or are these consequences for human behavior? “Just like clay in the potter’s hand,” the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, “so are you in my hand.”  Is this good news?   \\nDuring Jeremiah’s lifetime there were tumultuous shifts of power in the ancient Middle East, with the breakup of the Assyrian empire and the rise of Babylonian power.  The political and religious elite of Israel was often greedy and corrupt, making unwise alliances, and Jeremiah spoke the truth as he saw it.  Here, Jeremiah struggles to warn the King of the consequences of drifting from God’s commitment with them, as the nation falls deeper into idol worship, economic corruption and mistreatment of the lower classes.  \\nSometimes a pot is spoiled in the potter’s hand.  Maybe the clay wasn’t mixed right.  The walls of the pot suddenly fly askew and collapse.  Stuff happens.  Notice how the potter in Jeremiah’s vision reworks the spoiled pot into another vessel, “as seemed good to him.”  God the potter is apparently a master of re-cycling and transformation.  The analogy may break down a bit here. The clay is not animate and has no free will, BUT…  If the clay can stay on the potter’s wheel, it has a chance of being reworked.   Think of our situation as a congregation, emerging from some difficult years of conflict.  In what ways are we called as a church to “stay on the potter’s wheel?”  How are we being remodeled into some new shape for some new purpose?\\nJesus understood that following God’s lead, staying on the potter’s table and letting God form and reform us, was not going to be easy.  In this passage from Luke, Jesus warns the crowds around him: following me will challenge your family and friendship connections, and your relationship with all that you own.  He goes over the top with his language: yes, folks, you are going to have to HATE both those closest to you and even your precious life itself.   What will this look like?  Jesus called it “cross bearing.”  As much as we may be offended to hear it, Jesus is on to something:  family, friendships and possessions can sometimes get in the way.  Is my walk with Jesus impeded by the extremes of pleasing, or maybe defying, a certain person at every turn?  Is my life so filled with the complications of acquiring and maintaining my possessions that there is little space left for me to be re-worked and transformed in God’s hands?  \\n \\tSome years back, I encountered a community of people who were so clear about being in God’s hands that it really rattled me.  About a year and a half after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, my husband Chris and I drove south to deliver a truckload of used musical instruments.   These were donations from people in both Grand Marais and Silver Bay, given to replace destroyed equipment in one of New Orleans’ flooded schools.  Heading further east along the Gulf coast, we joined a UCC pastor friend and her youth group for a week of rebuilding houses in Biloxi, MS at Back Bay Mission, a UCC supported relief agency.  This is the non-profit that our congregation supported over the years through the annual Shrimp Boil dinner.  I spent days covered in chalky dry-wall Spackle while Chris cooked meals for the some several dozen hungry volunteers.  Mostly I marveled at how little we seemed to accomplish in this coastal fishing community where homes and livelihood were barely recovered from Katrina’s devastating storm surge.   It seemed like one more story of “too little, too late,” in a place that local government and our wider country had already forgotten.  How was this place possibly still “in God’s hands?” I asked myself.   \\n\\tOne evening, tired and discouraged, our group talked with staff members of Back Bay Mission.  The UCC pastor who directed volunteers in this recovery work started playing the piano and teaching us a contemporary spiritual.  Pastor Don explained that he wanted us to sing this song at a preaching festival down at the large Tabernacle Baptist Church we would visit later that week.  We were doubtful about our Anglo ability to compete in any kind of choral face-off with larger, spirited African American choirs.  Pastor Don urged Chris take over the keyboard and we dutifully worked on our song.  And as we practiced, I realized the lyrics were slowly pushing me off a theological edge.  \\n\\tHe’s an on-time God, yes He is.  He’s an on-time God, yes He is.\\n\\tHe may not come when you want Him, but He’ll be there right on time.  \\n\\tHe’s an on-time God, yes He is.  I was disturbed by the patriarchal language of calling God “he” and I really wasn’t convinced that this is how God acts in the world.\\n\\tSeveral nights later, Chris led our small group in offering this song in the packed Tabernacle Baptist.  Our voices sounded meek and hesitant; I felt embarrassed.  But suddenly the full-tilt house band swung in behind us.  The three visiting choirs and the whole congregation were on their feet, singing and clapping.  Wow, we were starting to sound great!  To our amazement, everyone knew the song by heart and they joined in with exuberant joy, belting out these paradoxical words.  God may not come when you want him, but he’ll be there right on time. Many of these people had lost their homes, their businesses, even family members in the storm surge. Neighbors and friends had been relocated far away.  Their beautiful sanctuary had been flooded with 9 feet of filthy storm water and debris.   And here they were, in spite of natural disaster compounded by years of systemic racism and regional poverty, disappeared tidal marshes that could have protected the fragile coastline, our own federal government’s blundered recovery efforts, here they were in spite of all this chaos singing of God’s faithful timing!  Gathered in their newly re-built sanctuary, they were very clear they were still in God’s hands, being molded into a new future together.  \\nSometimes I feel like the clay pot that is my life has gotten terribly wobbly, misshapen, a mess.  Think of what is driving you nuts, making you anxious in your own life right now.  All of our instincts tell us to reactively just jump off that potter’s wheel of whatever situation is stressing us out.  Ignore, lash out, silently hold a grudge, retaliate, despair, disappear.   “Re-center me, Holy One,” I have to pray at times like this:  “God, I am in your hands and that is an ok place to be.   Show me the wider picture, open my heart to what I need to understand, what I need to face and confess and do.”  Pay attention this week to which situations, which relationships, which possessions seem to pull you off the potter’s wheel, out of God’s hands.    Ask to be as pliable as clay; pray to be reworked into new shapes, even into a new vessel.  We are in God’s timely hands.  And this is Good News.  Amen.\\t\\t',\n",
       " \"\\tThere is a disquieting edge to today’s scripture reading from Mark.   Jesus speaks of his impending suffering and rejection by the religious authorities.  “I am going to be killed,” he tells his friends.  Mark adds an aside for the reader:  “He said all this quite openly.”  In earlier chapters, Mark writes that when Peter had identified him as “the Messiah,” Jesus says to tell no one.  Among Jews of the first century, the hope for a new Messiah was centered around deliverance from Imperial Rome’s oppression.  The coming of the Messiah meant restoration of political and economic power for a downtrodden people.  Jesus doesn’t contradict the disciples’ expectations….until this moment.  Now, the other shoe drops.  “The type of Messiah I am talking about,” Jesus tells them:  “is one who suffers and is rejected by the powers that be.”  This is such confusing and disturbing news that the disciples apparently don’t even hear the part about him rising in three days.  \\n\\t\\n\\tJesus’ close follower, Peter, is particularly rattled.  We can see him pull Jesus aside and speak in a harsh, low tone of rebuke.  “Knock it off, Jesus.  Stop the hype. You’re scaring us.”  Jesus snaps back at him: “No, YOU back off Peter.  You’re as bad as that force I confronted out in the wilderness; that Great Deceiver!  You’re coming from a limited viewpoint.  Your mind is stuck on a limited human perspective, not on the things of God.”  I wonder if part of what he meant was:  Peter, you are stuck in your head.  \\n\\t\\n\\tBut then things start to really tumble, as Jesus turns to the assuredly stunned crowd who has been watching this dramatic interchange.  “All the rest of you,” he declares,  “if you want to be my followers, you too must be ready to suffer.  Deny yourself.  Take up your cross.  If you try to grab on and save your life, you are going to lose it.”  This is not good news.\\n\\t\\n\\tCan’t you just see people start to shift uneasily, glancing with furrowed brows at each other?  What the heck is Jesus talking about?  “For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?” \\n\\t\\n\\t“Well, let me tell you, there is a lot I hope to gain in this world,” individuals in the crowd may well have been thinking.  “Esteem and respect within my community, for one thing!  A good crop this spring, a healthy donkey, those Romans off my back with all their taxes and restrictions, some security for my family and my old age.  Lose your life to save it?  That does not make any sense.”   How might have we each responded, hearing Jesus’ words first-hand?\\n\\tCynthia Bourgeault is an Episcopal priest, author and retreat leader in the growing field of contemplative Christian spirituality.  She writes in her book Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind about our modern-day challenges in understanding Jesus.    “A good part of the difficulties we sometimes run into trying to make our Christianity work stem from the fact that right from the start people missed how different Jesus’ approach really was.”  She continues by describing how “underlying all of his teaching is a clarion call to a radical shift in consciousness (not just in our actions).”  Jesus called people to “repentance,” which Bourgeault describes as going way beyond feeling sorry about mistakes and confessing wrongdoing.  The Greek word for repentance is metanoia - meaning meta to go beyond, the noia the mind.  Jesus was calling people to a change of perception that entails going beyond the rational mind, and engaging a transformation of the heart.   \\n\\tOur dear, logical brains, as useful as they are for making distinctions between things like on or off, fresh or spoiled, legal or illegal, tend to favor perceiving in this “either-or” binary mode.  This or that, right or wrong, safe or unsafe.  Jesus had an uncanny way of sensing that if our consciousness stays stuck in this kind of operating system, as Bourgeault would call it, we are going to have problems in our most important relationships with others and with God.   And we are not going to be able to comprehend most of what Jesus was talking about when he describes God’s extraordinary grace, God’s extravagant hospitality and the transformative love that is here to be experienced and shared among us.  We can’t seem to grasp this interconnected whole of all that is with our logical minds.  We keep making black and white distinctions.  As the 13th century Sufi mystic poet, Rumi, wrote:    “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there.”  Our rational brain has a hard time imagining such a place.  Something, or someone, is either right or wrong.  And consequently, we have a hard time letting go of resentments.  Our calls for accountability tend to lack compassion.  We want our pound of flesh when we have been wronged.  Win or lose, says the brain.  Either they win or I win.  Our human mind has a hard time conceiving of a win/win.   Or, as Jesus said to Peter, “you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”\\n\\tCynthia Bourgeault continues: “In Jesus everything hangs together around a single center of gravity, and (we) need to know what this center is before you can sense the subtle but cohesive power of the path he is laying out.” The center of this path is what apostle Paul suggests as kenosis, the Greek work meaning “to let go” or “to empty oneself.”   “Everything he did, he did by self-emptying…he emptied himself and descended into human form.  And he emptied himself still further (“even unto death on the cross,” writes Paul)….In whatever life circumstance, Jesus always responded with the same motion of self emptying.”  Bourgeault observes that this is actually a rather “reckless path and extravagant path, which is attained not by storing up (spiritual) energy or concentrating the life force, but through throwing it all away – or giving it all away…..not through acquisition or attainment but through self-emptying….this is the way of kenosis, the revolutionary path that Jesus introduced into the consciousness of the West.”  Join us on Wednesday evenings in Lent to explore more of her perspective on Jesus teachings!\\n\\t\\n\\tCynthia Bourgeault concludes her provocative invitation to this kind of self-emptying by reminding us of the tale of Babette from a short story by Isak Dinesen.  I came to this story, a number of years ago, in the simple and evocative movie, “Babette’s Feast.”  The film is about a dour and solemn religious sect in rural Denmark.  Babette has been a famous chef in 19th century Paris, but loses her livelihood and her loved ones in the city riots of 1871.  She shows up on the doorstep of two sisters of this Danish religious group, who are striving to continue the pastoral leadership of their bitter and divided religious community after their father and founder has died.   The post brings an unexpected surprise one day: Babette has won three million francs in the lottery back in France!  Everyone expects her to leave town with her windfall, but Babette decides to treat this dour religious community to an extravagant dinner of fine, French cuisine.  \\n\\t\\n\\tThis is neither a logical nor practical move on Babette’s part.  The community never eats like this, and they greet her offer with suspicion.  But attending to a yearning deep within her own heart, Babette sends away for the exquisite food, wine and spirits, elegant dinnerware, crystal glassware, linens.  The dinner preparations are complicated and time-consuming.  On the evening of the meal, the community arrives wary and nervous, amazed at such extravagance, unaccustomed to such sensual delights.  But over the evening, mellowed by full stomachs and good wine, they let down their guard. They begin to talk and banter, they quietly acknowledge old hurts and extend forgiveness. They relax into a heart-space of unexpected compassion and openness with one another.  Somehow, they get to Rumi’s “field beyond wrongdoing and rightdoing.”  \\t\\n\\tAfter the meal, they all expect Babette to return to France as a rich woman, and are astounded to hear she has spent, has wasted, all her winnings on this one evening.  But Babette has “self-emptied;” all the money has been spent.  And she is surprisingly at peace, and returns to cooking for the two sisters in their modest life and simple home.  But Babette has reflected back to the whole community what God’s extravagant generosity of heart is really like, of what human hospitality can make possible.  And nothing is quite the same within each of them.\\n\\t\\n\\tJesus spoke of losing our life in order to gain it.  This is so contrary to our world of acquisition, guardedness, protecting our own, and defensive posturing.  Jesus knew intuitively that we have been created to listen to a deeper yearning within our own inner being.  He understood that self-emptying love was really what each of our hearts desire.  He knew that this is what would change us, over and over.  Such a challenge for us.  Such a gift.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tA colleague tells the story of a Sunday School song she used to sing as a young child.  She and the other preschoolers were invited to crouch down, scrunch themselves into balls on the church basement carpet and start singing together: “Read your Bible, pray every day, pray every day, pray every day. Read your Bible, pray every day, pray every day! \\xa0 “We started as seeds, all curled up,” my colleague explained.  “Then with the next verse, we would slowly unfurl.” \\xa0Read your Bible, pray every day, and you’ll grow, grow, grow (repeat).”\\xa0 Up, up the children would eagerly rise, responding to this invitation by stretching to the ceiling.  Then the third verse, “Don’t\\xa0read your Bible,\\xa0don’t\\xa0ever pray, and you’ll shrink, shrink, shrink (repeat).”  The children would quickly collapse back down on the floor, sprawling and giggling.  “We thought it was a silly game,” she mused, “but as an adult I now realize the song was right on.”   (  Debbie Thomas)\\n\\n\\tRead your Bible, pray everyday.   How do you find yourself responding to this advice?  With pleasure?  Or does it sound like a command, a harangue from a conservative church you left?  Is it filled with negative triggering that leaves you feeling uncomfortable, rebellious or just plain annoyed?  Does it sound like an invitation that you know you should accept, but your attempts at daily Bible reading and praying leave you confused, bored, and guilty you aren’t more consistent?   This morning I invite us to consider the first part of this childhood song, “read your Bible,” while acknowledging that the “pray every day” part is worthy of a different sermon.   Think a moment about your own life: am I spiritually shrinking or growing?  Think about our life as a congregation: are we spiritually shrinking or growing? How might an increased soaking in the scriptures of our faith grow vitality, courage and conviction among us as followers of Jesus?\\n\\n\\tThese two texts are offered by the Revised Common Lectionary, which are Biblical passages offered each week and followed by us, other Protestant and Catholic churches around the globe. The Nehemiah text and the reading from Luke, are writings separated by hundreds of years, but each focus on what it means to read and interpret scripture within a faith community.   \\n\\n\\tWhen I hear this Nehemiah text from the Hebrew scriptures, I picture a scene that seems quite different from our quiet, contained sanctuary with comfortable pews.  I see a crowd of exhausted and conflicted people, doubtful about sustaining a new life back in their devastated homeland of Judah.  After years of exile in faraway Babylon, with its unfamiliar Persian religion and social customs, these folks are finally rebuilding their sacred city and worship center of Jerusalem.  But so much feels foreign to them; nothing looks the same…familiar buildings, trusted traditions, people they knew, are all gone.  Perhaps it’s not unlike a congregation which has struggled through conflict and lost much that is familiar; old ways of doing things, shared assumptions of what it means to be church together, and most painfully, long-time members. Perhaps like us as we face tough questions of beginning again, the Jews wondered how to resurrect their life together.   Would they be able to reclaim a sense of their own identity as a people of God’s covenant?  The assembly gathers under the hot Mediterranean sun; men, women and older children jostling together.  There at the Water Gate, the one place in the city where “everyone could be present, even those considered ritually unclean”…a place for communal deliberation and decisions, where all were welcome (W. Carter Lester in FOW, Year C, Volume 1, p. 266).   \\n\\n\\tApparently the crowd stood and listen throughout the morning, as the High Priest Ezra read from the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.   The Torah, their holy law.  As Christians, I’m afraid we have a rather warped view of what Torah meant to both ancient Israel and now to contemporary Jews.  Torah was always less of a legal system, which cramps and condemns people. It was the guide to how to live as God’s covenant community, showing justice and mercy to all.  It was considered to be a precious gift of holy instruction; “Your words were found and I ate them,” wrote the Jewish prophet Jeremiah, “and your words became a joy to me and the delight of my heart.”  As the gathered assembly, young and old, listening to the Torah being read that day, they cried out “Amen, Amen!”  We read that interpreters moved among them, explaining how understanding of the Torah was changing with their changing circumstances.   I’m reminded that we don’t do well just reading the Bible on our own: we need the guidance and support of those who can help us with historical context, translation concerns, how one piece of text fits into a greater whole.  For these people, Torah was a pathway, a tutor, a flexible and compassionate guide to living together in justice and in joy.  The people bowed their heads to the ground and wept.  With relief, with new clarity, renewed purpose.  As they soaked in their sacred scriptures, the way forward for them as community became clear once again.  What might this say to us as a congregation, as we move on from our reconciliation process into rebuilding our life together?  How will we be guided beyond our own preferences and even our best thinking?\\n\\n\\tThe Gospel writer Luke introduces Jesus first as a teacher of the Torah. Not as a healer or miracle worker.  Following his baptism by John the Baptist and then a time alone in the desert where he is confronted with temptations to power and glory, Jesus goes public as a teacher in the region of Galilee.  In our text today, Jesus has returned to his hometown and joins his family and neighbors in worship at their local synagogue.   The time of prayers, singing and Hebrew scripture would have been lay led, with the community’s men stepping forward to read from the scrolls.  Jesus stands and is handed the Torah portion for the day, and reads portion from the prophet Isaiah:  \\n\\tThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.\\n\\n\\tBy this time in Jewish tradition, these words had been connected to the community’s expectation of the Messiah who would come and transform Israel by literally saving it from foreign oppression.  After Jesus finishes reading, Jesus sits down among them.  People know something is up; all eyes are fixed on him.  From where he is seated, Jesus simply says: Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.   But the world looks no different; what does this mean?\\n\\n\\tOne Biblical commentator suggests: Note that Jesus reads from their own (his own) Scriptures, which is to suggest that the Bible is both the greatest friend and the greatest enemy of the community of faith. Everything that would challenge us most deeply is right here, right there, in this odd, disordered and difficult book, a book that reads us as much as we read it.  (Anthony Robinson, 1/27/13 lectionary web-blog).\\n\\tConsider this:  what “reads” you these days?  What is it that is wider than your own individual insight, even larger than our own collective perspective as a group?  What pushes each of us beyond fulfilling our own ego needs for security, esteem, influence?   What we do as church is to let a very old book called the Bible “read us as much as we read it.”  To both comfort and challenge us. The Biblical message has this tenacious way of fulfilling itself as we hear it.  It works in us in unexpected ways, if we let it.  The Bible becomes both “friend and enemy” to us as individuals and to us as a congregation, calling us to grow, not shrink. We soak in it’s stories and are compelled to reach out to the brokenhearted, to announce release to prisoners of war and perhaps even to immigration violators, to encourage each other through our personal “blind” spots.  And, here’s the tough one:  we are also challenged to “announce the acceptable year of the Lord” which was a code word for the ancient custom of the Year of Jubilee.  Torah prescribed that every 50 years debts would be forgiven, people would be allowed to return to homes and land from which they had been disposed, and slaves were set free. What might it look like if we proclaimed a Year of Jubilee here?  \\n\\n\\tChurch is where we come to get “read” by something bigger than our personal experience or best ideas.  To be re-oriented, given fresh eyes to see God’s world in a different way.  To be infused with renewed energy for the freeing and healing of ourselves and the world around us.  Thanks be to God.',\n",
       " 'All Saints Sunday.  The shift of warm, bright summer into cold, dark winter seems to propel peoples and cultures all over the world look into the past and remember their dead. But in northern Europe during pre-Christian time, autumn was not just a grateful harvest time, but a period of growing  uneasiness.   As daylight shortened, the landscape would turn barren and cold. The start of the unpredictable and precarious endurance test of winter.  How does one engage and transform this foreboding concern about the impending dark months ahead? Celtic religious leaders proclaimed an “end-of-year festival for Samhain, (saw-whean) the lord of death.”  Ritually re-enacting the “death of death,” and with it, the possibilities of new life in spring, the people would light huge bonfires, burn sacrifices and pray to dispel evil spirits.  Their symbolic language and rituals opened the doors of their perceptions about the holy and about themselves.  This was a time when the veil between the seen and unseen world was considered to be quite thin; they believed that both the community and the individual had a part in acknowledging and managing this sacred divide.  Each family unit would bravely extinquish their home fire, and then carefully relight it from the “sacred flame of the village bonfire,” and the New Year would begin.  \\nAs early Christian missionaries entered the Celtic regions of France and the British isles, they brought the language of the “death of death” in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  This theology of hope and eternal life conquering death resonated with many of the people.  The institutional Church slowly incorporated pre-Christian festivals and new symbolic language and liturgies emerged.  The October 31st festival honoring Samhain became All Hallowed Eve, November 1st became All Saints Day to honor the Church’s growing number of martyrs who died for their belief in Jesus Christ and eventually November 2 All Soul’s day honored all baptized Christians in the Church, living and departed.\\n\\tThe ancients acknowledged this time of year as a “thin place” when the boundaries, the veil, between the past and the present, the living and the dead thinned.  Perhaps you too have noticed how in mid-autumn these distinctions seem to fade at odd moments. Low slant of yellow light, early nightfall.   Unexpectedly, the perceived distance between me and God’s mystery will close at the oddest moments.  I gaze down the street and am startled by yet another burning bush.  The green of tree leaves seems to drain away around me, heaping into dried piles at my feet.  There is a reflective quiet for me in these days, if I pause to notice amidst my busyness.   What do you notice in this season? Sometimes I feel achingly joyful and other times strangely melancholy. And, as I pay attention to nature’s shifts around me and the draw of memory within me, God seems oddly closer, more attentive almost.  I think of people who are no longer in my life.  I remember times of glowing success and times of disappointment or failure. I ponder my own seemingly saintly and sinful self and the choices that have emerge that mixed nature.   The season itself seems to open the door of my perception of God and who I am.   \\n\\tIn the middle of my autumnal ponderings this year, I re-discovered these words of Danish theologican Søren Kierkegaard: \"There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.\"  Applying this more universally, I’ll read it again:  “there is nothing with which we each are so afraid as getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  \\n\\tPut another way, is there something unsettling about how saintly we might be? None of us really want to appear “saintly.”  Adult costume stores sell far more sin-oriented costumes at Halloween than saintly outfits.  When praised we might even mutter gruffly, “don’t get me wrong, I’m no saint.”.     Yet, the apostle Paul addresses the church members in Ephesis as saints, “hagio” in Greek meaning “God’s holy ones.”  According to the Book of Acts, this is how early Christians refered to each other. The word was not meant to imply that these people were holy as in perfect but that by association with God through Jesus Christ they were holy, whole.   That’s all of us, “inheritors” as Paul writes in his letter to the church at Ephesis,  so we “might live for the praise of God’s glory.”  Even with our propensity to makes mistakes, to hurt others, to ignore God….to “sin” we would say theologically….We are God’s holy ones.  The faith language of “saint” and “sinner” opens the doors of my inner perception so I can humbly and courageously understand my place and call in God’s world.  Perhaps this is where Paul was going when he wrote to his friends in Ephesus:  “I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ…may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know God, so that with the eyes of your heart enlighted, you may know what is the hope to which God has called you, what are the riches of God’s glorious inheritance among the saints.”  \\n\\tThe most fearful thing for us, writes Kierkegaard, is “getting to know how enormously much we are each capable of doing and becoming.”  Capable of sin, capable of holiness and wholeness.  I wonder if this is true also for groups of people, like faith communities?  Other writers have refered to the human tendency to “play small.”  In what ways might each of us “play small” in our personal lives, in our work lives?  It can go either way I guess:  we can play small regarding our sin, ignoring our actions as perpetrators or bystanders to betrayal and hurt.  We can play small regarding our holiness, our call to be a saint.  How might we be “playing small” as a congregation, in ways that limit what God might want to do here?    How might we more fully affirm and live out this hope, this inheritance, that God has calls us to?\\n\\tThe quaint hymn we sang as we began worship, “I sing a Song of the Saints of God,” affirms that the Saints are all around us and are us. Not perfect people, mind you, but people who are patient, brave and true.  As we remember those “saints” who have been among us here at Emmaus and in our family lives, we can think about their patience, their bravery and truthfulness, and consider how we each might be more patient with each other and with ourselves, how we each might be braver in both our private lives and our wider public lives, and more truthful about all kinds of things.  They were not perfect; they made mistakes, hurt others, sinned more or less like the rest of us. Surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, the “eyes of our hearts” are opened to new things we are capable of doing and being as a church.  We step forward to spread God’s good news to new generations, because we are God’s holy ones, saints and sinners, all.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Why are all the people in the synagogue staring at him?  He tells them that these words are being fulfilled right now, in their hearing.

Slaves and prisoners were freed, debts forgiven and land was redistributed.    \\n\\nJubilee year…a year of forgiveness.\\n\\nThe Spirit of the Lord was upon Jesus to proclaim this good news, to the people in Nazareth….and to us.

       " 'At the beginning of John’s text for today, it is the “evening on that day” after Mary Magdalene had unexpectedly stumbled upon the Risen Jesus in a garden outside his tomb.  The rest of Jesus’ disciples anticipate that the authorities will come after them too, as they have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.   As we dig down into this text, take a moment to notice that John’s Gospel says they are hiding “for fear of the Jews.”  But wait!  The disciples were Jews.  Historians have discovered that the alleged hostility towards the Jews of Jesus time recorded in the Gospels and Book of Acts, is a reflection of something that happened decades later.  When these books were being written! It wasn’t until the late first century, early second, that tension arose between the increasingly Gentile, or non-Jewish, Christians and the local synagogues.  We hear echoes of this hostility in the reading from Acts, where several of the disciples are being tried by the Jewish court in Jerusalem for their continued teaching and healing in Jesus’ name. Negative generalizations about Jewish communities originate in this false accusation that Jews were “Christ-killers.”  The occupying Roman authorities killed Jesus the Christ.  But this accusation of murder, and a conviction that Christianity is superior to Judaism, leads to the eventual persecution of Jews down through the centuries.  Right up through the Holocaust and yesterday’s deadly attack during a Passover celebration at a synagogue in San Diego.  This whole issue of the rise of anti-semitism is an aside to today’s story, but our complicity as Christians is worth exploring at another time. \\nIn today’s text from the Gospel of John, we see Jewish men and women, disciples of Jesus, eating and talking behind locked doors.  Suddenly, to their astonishment, a stranger appears in their midst.  “Peace be with you,” says the stranger in greeting.  Not unlike Jesus’ greeting of peace at the Last Supper. But they do not have a clue who this is.  Jesus followers do not recognize this stranger as Jesus until he shows them the wounds in his hands and side.  They are in hiding, feeling anxious, victimized, wounded by grief, themselves.  But then they see Jesus’ wounds.   Their perspective changes.\\nNoticing someone else’s wounds, their suffering, can bring us a helpful change of perspective.  So writes the former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. (in his book Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel. )  Quite often we get stuck in our own loss, our own pain, our own woundness.  Williams describes how we ourselves may identify with Jesus’ sufferings on the cross and may be “consoled at the thought of God sharing in our suffering” through Jesus sufferings (p. 69).   Part of our sense of moving forward after Easter may even include a sense of solidarity with Jesus; God understands my sufferings through those of Jesus. (p. 69-70).   \\nBut, we may very well feel victimized by our situation or by what someone has done to us.  The problem, says Williams, is how quickly we can move into: “my suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.”  And if we’re not careful,  “nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.”  This can happen in families, in friendships and in local congregations. \\nIt’s as if we want to secure a righteous position for ourselves:  We find ourselves standing over and against the other, wearing what Williams calls the “moral armor of innocence.”  We make ourselves the innocent victims in a given situation. Be it ongoing anti-Semitism in today’s world, continued devastation of our planet, the denigrating Muslims or blaming others for church and family problems: It is so easy to slip on this “moral armor of innocence.”  \\nThe disciples encounter the Risen Jesus and are suddenly faced with their own lack of innocence.  They are confronted with their own culpability, their own passive participation in the violence that caused his death.  And they are faced with someone they don’t initially recognize, being so caught up in their past actions and inactions, their sense of suffering and hopelessness. \\nBut what about Thomas?  He apparently wasn’t in the room when Jesus first appeared to the group. He is the one disciple who gets labeled as the “doubter” because he demands some visible, tangible evidence that Jesus is alive again.  I can hardly blame him. And if Thomas finally got to receive some hard-core evidence, why don’t we get some?  I’ve run myself in circles over this question, and always wondered if I was missing something in this Thomas part of the story.  But this week I stumbled on a commentary by Rev. Nancy Claire Pittman, a New Testament scholar at Phillips Theological Seminary in Oklahoma.  She writes: “Here is the real problem with Thomas.  In rejecting the disciples’ good news about what they have seen (of Jesus), Thomas rebuffs the very friends with whom he has shared life for so long.  He seems stuck in his own sense of being excluded; perhaps he had only stepped out for a moment and missed the Risen Jesus’ first visit.  Perhaps he spent a week with his aging mother!  Now he has returned and brought with him this sense of missing out, being offended, feeling wounded.  Thomas’ words….carry a powerful sting: ‘there’s no way I will believe unless I see for myself.’”  “Throughout John’s Gospel,” continues Pittman,”….love and trust within the faithful community are the significant expression of the work of Christ in their midst.”  Thomas’ angrily challenges his closest friends’ testimony.  Love and trust are gone.  And it is “this kind of radical suspicion of our companions in faith,” insists Pittman, “(that) tears at the fabric of our churches today.” \\nShe concludes that the problem with Thomas’ doubt is that it is a “community-shattering doubt.”  Wow.  “if our churches are to be faithful to the risen Christ,” claims Pittman, “we must stop distrusting our friends in Christ.  At the very least, we must stop questioning motives, doubting dedication, and thinking the worst of our companions when they state a different opinion or offer a contradictory version.  We must learn to believe not simply in the goodness of the Lord, but in the goodness of one another – even when they deliver the strangest news, (like) ‘we have seen the Lord!’” (p. 399 and 401, Feasting on the Word, Year C, Vol. 2)\\nThis stranger, this Risen Jesus, approaches Thomas and the rest of them with a steady openness and compassionate words.  “Peace be with you.” Chill out everyone.   “As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” Stop hiding; You all have work to do.  Might it be that this is how God is with each of us?  Our insistence on our own innocence, in face of our culpability, is met with openness and compassion?  Our own assumed guiltiness is met with the same openness and compassion?  Jesus breathes on them, writes John:  and his breath brings the disciples back from their wild swings between arrogant innocence or despairing remorse….his breath brings them back from death.  Slowly it dawns on the men and women in the room that Jesus holds no grudge or resentment about their passive betrayal of him.  There, in his presence, they are not just remembering their dead friend but are now experiencing a living person. He speaks again, charging them:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”  Would this be making any sense if they themselves were not experiencing Jesus’ love and forgiveness of their sorry selves, right in that moment?   As they begin to re-gain confidence and trust in one another?\\n“Stop healing and teaching in the name of Jesus!” the nervous religious authorities will later insist.  “You’ll bring down the wrath of the Romans upon us!” But the early disciples found themselves approached and forgiven by the presence of their Risen Lord.  We too are a body of people trying to witness to this reality of forgiveness and renewal.  We too are called to be a place where others can come to meet the Risen Lord, again and again.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.   ',\n",
       " '\\tAnd aren’t we glad we don’t stand for the reading of the Gospel in this congregation?  The Common Lectionary of readings that we share with Protestant and Catholic churches around the world has brought us a long piece of New Testament scripture this morning, one that makes for an intricate weaving of themes. Which is an interesting sycronicity, in my view, because we have a full plate in our life together here at Emmaus.  We are at a crucial point in our intentional interim work together as a congregation, in this extended transition period between called ministers.  The Discovery Team has been working for the last year to help you discuss the ups and downs of Emmaus’ history, your current core values and shared beliefs.  The Team is now wrestling with identifying a unifying vision of what ministries God is calling you to be in the future.  Like our text from John, this is long work; it is also all slow and patient work, and it is not moving fast enough for some among us.  I wonder if it isn’t a bit unsettling to think of this diverse community settling on one unifying vision about its future.  Perhaps some of you will not feel included in a vision for Emmaus’ emerging focus and ministries,… then what?  Would that send some people packing?  Would it bring new people, perhaps unexpected sorts people, to your door?  In the midst of these questions, the Pastoral Search Committee, has just been elected and meeting, and is assigned with finding a new ministerial candidate to be presented to the congregation for a vote.  Theirs’ will also, by necessity, be long, slow and patient work.  Their’s is not a quick find-and-hire task; it is a discernment process of opening to God’s direction in searching for new minister who will equip and empower you to make your emerging vision become real.  Ah, if the right minister could just get chosen, one seasoned and wise but not too expensive, then we could get on with it……but get on with what?  Beyond institutional survival, to what emerging purpose is Emmaus called at this point?\\n\\tThere are clues for us in scripture.  The texts are the windows through which we can see the outlines of God’s nature and God’s movement in the world (Holy Conversations Gil Rendle and Allice Man, pl 143) I suggest we peer into this story from the Gospel of John and see what we notice.  You might want to keep your pew Bibles open to the passage.  What catches your attention in this story?  Is it this question of human suffering and what causes it? A man blind from birth – did someone sin here?  Or is it the healing stories in general – in what way was Jesus a healer -  and what do we make of seemingly miraculous healings in the scientific age of the 21st century?   Does the broader theme of change intrigue you?  There are a cast of characters here that seem befuddled, annoyed by the physical change in this man – from blind to sighted.  The disciples, the religious scholars called Phraisees, the parents of the blind man: each with their bewildered questioning, demands for problem solving when the new is not visible visible (is this the guy? no, that’s not him); the reasons for the change aren’t quite clear (where’s the person who healed him, what’s his story, who does Jesus think he is?).  People don’t always react well when the way forward is uncertain.  They all have different concerns about this healing act and they each have a survival agenda.  What are these human systems worried about, what are their fears?  The way forward for this congregation is uncertain; do you find the story stirring some of your own concerns?  \\n\\tThe characters question the man formerly known as “that Blind Beggar” ….and he replies over and over, I don’t know what happened, I was blind and now I see, I was blind and now I see!  Or is it Jesus that you wonder about….you notice how he moves in and out of the action; on the scene, claiming he is the light of the world.  He disappears while Phraisees and parents debate among themselves, question the now sighted man.  Then Jesus is back on stage, challenging those who think they have physical sight to look again, beyond the surface layer.  “Are you allowing yourself to be inwardly illuminated?” he demands.  Does this question of inward insight intrigue or perplex you? \\n\\tEveryone named in the story is a Jew, including Jesus.  It is a bit disingenuous for the writer to single out the Pharisees as the resistant “Jews.”  Scholars think this reflects more the tension between the writer’s own late first century church community and the local synagogues over Jesus.  What is clear is that everyone in the story is part of the same community of faith, but they have different points of view on what has happened in the past, and different emotional reactions and concerns about the future: They differ on how the man became blind, the implications of being healed, and just who this person Jesus really is.  Perhaps it is this multiplicity of viewpoints, this variety of perceptions, this different takes on the meaning of events that makes this an important story for us at Emmaus church right now.\\n\\tI wonder if the disciples could really see the man sitting by the side of the road.  They seem to see a condition (Blindness) which becomes theoretical situation which invokes debate about the cause of human illness.  No mention of any compassionate interaction with the guy, just this rather abstract discussion about whether or not the apparent disability is a punishment for some moral lapse by the man or his parents.  This was one popular understanding of illness or disability in the Hebrew Bible, although it is contradicted by the story of Job and his sufferings.  But it was also commonly assumed in their tradition that blindness was a disfigurement or a blemish on a person, and this made them unfit for service in the house of worship or being around other people.  You were clearly being punished by God and you became an outcast in your community.  Some of this undercurrent exists in our day about illness.  At the same time, the Hebrew prophets described God’s loving compassion for all humans in terms that affected whole communities.  Jesus will quote these references to the Messianic age where the God of compassion will release the captives, feed the hungry, bind up the brokenhearted and make the blind to see,. \\n\\tThe disciples look at the blind man and pose an assumptive question – who sinned here - and Jesus flatly disagrees.  This isn’t about punishment for moral mistakes.  God doesn’t cause these things to happen, but in that human suffering happens, it can become an opportunity for God to bring healing and hope.   Here, a man is healed and now has the possibility of being restored to his community.   Why is this so troubling for people?\\n It will be just these works of God, the healing of the man’s sight and his reconnecting with community, that the religious leaders and the man’s community will not be able to accept.  And they get caught up in the scandal of Jesus healing on the Sabbath.   They can’t figure out how this Jesus, who is obviously a sinner who hangs out with losers with disabilities, could possibly be an agent of God’s healing realm, the Messianic age.  They grill the parents:  “Is this your son?  Was he really blind from birth?”   While the formerly blind man  expresses his growing understanding of who Jesus is, as one who offers the possibility of transformation, the religious leaders seem more and more unable to see.   The man keeps saying, I once was blind but now I see.  How did this happen, you ask? I don’t know.  I have been transformed, changed.  The parents appear worried they will be kicked out the synagogue; “don’t talk to us, go talk with our son!”  The community can’t seem to recognize the guy anymore; is that the same guy who sat and begged at the gates, they ask each other.  The Pharisees get really annoyed with all this common and challenge to their authority and drive the man out.  Jesus reappears on the scene, having heard that the man has been kicked out of the community.   He tells the man that he has come “so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.”  What?  Time and again, Jesus strategy seems to be: let’s upset the apple cart.  Transformation, change, is disruptive.   \\nWhen so much is changing around us, as it is in our world today, it may become even dangerous to assume that we are fully-sighted.  Such is the suggestion of Daniel Clendenin in his blog commentary on this passage this week.  “Surely we are not blind, are we?” demand the Pharisees.  None of us want to be considered lacking in vision during a visioning process!  It’s both embarrassing and somewhat threatening to acknowledge our own spiritual blindness when it comes to solving the problems in a congregation, suggests Clendenin.  We are part of a larger culture that is impatient, we are quick to identify and solve problems.  But churches are finding that old solutions just don’t work anymore.  The healing from old wounds and perceiving of God’s call in the midst of uncertain times, the deepening vitality and growth of a congregation, this means we too….like the blind man…may at times have to admit “I do not know.”  \\tWe do not know all the answers, we often can’t explain what we sense God doing in us and in our church, we just have to start the slow and patient work of opening our perceptions to God working within and among us.  We once were blind, but now we are starting to see….to see our past differently, to see each other more clearly and compassionately.  We start to see Jesus’ ongoing presence in our midst as both disruptive and transformative.  We courageously explain to each other what is unsettling about all that, what worries us, and also what excites us, what gives us hope.  And so we begin to see glimmers of God’s good future ahead of us.  This seeing thing is a long, slow, patient process.   May God give each of us the patience and hopefulness to engage.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tWhen was the last time any of us ventured into the Hebrew Bible book of Leviticus?  Probably not recently, if ever.  It seldom shows up in the Common Lectionary texts, the three-year cycle of scripture readings that we share with other Protestant and Catholic churches. This book from Jewish scriptures is the middle book in the ancient Torah, the five books of Jewish law.  As Christians, this is part of our holy scripture.  But I wouldn’t be surprised if you were wondering why!  It’s a meticulous and tedious list of rules, to be blunt. First section: numerous details about the role of priests and the rituals for the temple.  Little of this is observed in the Jewish community today because the ritual of temple sacrifice stopped in 70 AD with the final destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.  After this somewhat mind-numbing section, there are many verses about purity and uncleanliness.  Some of it is really strange to our modern sensibilities:  food laws about what is clean and unclean, purification rituals after childbirth and disease.  Then comes the section from which our text is taken today: the Holiness code.  Included are all sorts of teachings about practical, everyday holiness that sound really strange to us: don’t sacrifice your child to the Cannaite god, Molech, .  And don’t have sex with animals. What is a contemporary Christian, or Jew for that matter, to do with all this?  Why might the compilers of the Christian Common Lectionary include this passage to go along with today’s New Testament piece from Jesus about loving your enemies?  Are these passages just another version of “be good, be nice?”  Or is there a common thread in these passages that points beyond individual piety and morality?  I’m thinking there is, and I’m wondering if it has to do with an invitation to live in some kind of alternative community, being in the world but not quite of the world, as Jesus told his disciples.  Personally, I’m hungry for a word, for a vision that is both provocative and encouraging about how we live together as global community. The world we are living in seems to be such a hodgepodge of hostility and smugness, save-your-own-skin self-protectiveness and cynical hopelessness.  What we can do differently, or better, as communities, as a nation?  How do we do this living together in loving community thing when we are all so divided?   \\n\\tWe make an effort to take scripture seriously in this church, even as we do not take it literally, and yes, even when the passages initially appears off-putting.  Let’s dive into this passage that is purportedly coming from the mouth of the great Jewish leader Moses, who brought the Jewish people out of slavery Egypt and through the wilderness wanderings to the promised land.  Most Jewish scholars will tell you this portion of the law was most likely complied much later, after the return from Exile in Babylon and the re-building of the destroyed Temple – mid 6th century BCE.  It’s to be viewed “in the tradition” of this great leader. “You shall be holy,” Moses quotes God as proclaiming,  “for I the Lord your God am holy.”  Stop right there.  Holy?  We can be easily thrown off by this call to be “holy.”   We may try to avoid this challenge of being a model of holy perfection by simply turning to the words of the easy-going Jesus, but no such luck.  Apparently, Jesus was well-versed in this Leviticus passage, because in today’s passage he is saying pretty much the same thing in his sermon on the mount: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”\\n\\tBe holy.  Be perfect.  Well, that’s impossible.  And who wants to come to church to be shamed about their imperfections and mistakes and fallibilities?  Not me, and I don’t suppose you do either.  Who wants to be considered “holier than thou” anyway? \\n\\tThis holiness of which the Book of Leviticus speaks is not about uptight moral correctness. It’s about us being transformed as people, and community, as we practice imitating the character of God within community. The word “holy” in Hebrew actually means “separate.”  There is always this sense of God’s distinct difference form humans, AND Israel’s call to be separate, to be different, from the other nations.  They were to be a light to the nations, an example of God’s loving and merciful character.  What might this look like?  Levitius gave some direction for people in those times.  Unlike other nations, they were to leave some of their crops unpicked out on the edges of the field, leave some grapes on the vine and fruit on the trees, for the poor and the alien, the stranger, traveling in their midst.  I wonder what that might look like for us today, to leave some of our extra bounty out for others.  Cash you paycheck at the ATM and leave a few 20’s on the ground? Or might we as a nation follow the example of our Canadian friends and really buckle down on welcoming refugees into our midst.   Unlike other communities, the Jews were to pay their workers before they go home at night;  and were told not to give the disabled, the deaf and the blind, a hard time.  Will we stand by and watch protective labor laws be gutted and funding for programs for the disabled end?  \\n\\tThese admonitions in Leviticus are about how a whole society lives justly and in harmony with one another; how they govern themselves, how they care for the marginalized.  What might holiness look like in the public square, where more and more marginalized people are going to be left to struggle on their own?  What role might an inclusive, diverse, open faith community like Falcon Heights Church play in that public holiness?\\n\\t I re-read through my ordination vows recently, as the 38th anniversary of my ordination to the Christian ministry is this week.   I was struck by this particular question that I was asked that day:  Will you be zealous in maintaining both the truth of the gospel and the peace of the church, speaking the truth in love?   I realized what a difficult task this is, to let the truth of the gospel challenge us to action and also somehow keep the peace in a church….especially where everyone has different ideas about what both the “truth of the gospel” and the actions should might be.   I thought of how tempting it is in congregations, especially where there has been conflict over certain social justice issues, to lean more into maintaining a peace but not dealing with the truth of the gospel…mostly by just not talking about difficult Biblical and social issues anymore.  Churches can assume that feeding the poor by collecting food and money for lets us off the hook from exploring the reasons for world hunger, income disparity and homelessness, particularly in this country.  We worry that if we talk about public policies and practices, we will offend someone. In our reticence, we miss the chance to change the tone of the rhetoric in our communities, to build empathy and understanding across differences.   The world looses our voice for justice and compassion for all. \\n\\tBut what about Jesus’ specific directives: turn the other cheek, walk the extra mile, hand over your outer garment?  These seem impractical and naïve, even dangerous in our modern society where terrorists seek to harmus. Be holy, be separate, be different from the rules that run the rest of the world:  And what are the predominant rule in our culture?  Be strong, don’t be vulnerable; you must convince others with your forceful arguments, you must be right; fight back.  Name and be wary of your enemy; put up baracades and exclusionary laws and walls against them.  But Jesus won’t play by these rules.   \\n\\tHe isn’t going to resist the aggressor, “Jesus is going to resist the underlying paradigm of hostility and contempt involved in striking someone’s face with the flat of your hand, of suing someone to the point where you take their cloak (it was prohibited in Jewish law to go that far – everybody needed a cloak), or to force someone to carry your stuff for a mile.   And Jesus says: don’t cooperate “in the underlying paradighm of hate and brutality.” (Feasting n the Word, p. 384)   Sometime during this week, we are each going to be confronted with a choice about this.  It may not be dramatic.  It might be a casual but disparaging comment a friend or family member makes about this group or that group.   How will you, in that moment, calmly but clearly resist the endless cycle of enemy-making that is pervading our country.  Or someone provokes you and you choose not to lash back, but to disengage and refrain from retailiating.  How will you, how will I, do the opposite of what seems normal and reasonable, and in our resistance break the cycle of resentments, fear, hate?\\n\\tWhat Jesus is describing seems counter-intuitive. This is how you are to live, everyday, as part of God’s realm, he says:  Be a separate example of what true loving community looks like.  How often we read Jesus word’s and think he wants us to be wimps.  Far from it.  We are called to be an alternative community, where hopefulness and compassion rule.  Where holiness and perfection is a joy.  Because this is who we are created to be.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.  ',\n",
       " '\\tThe beginning of Jesus public ministry is remarkable for what he does NOT say.  One might expect him to jump right in with “hello everybody, now I want you to love one another!”  Or perhaps an admonition to act decent, caring, kind; something manageable on a person to person level.  Why doesn’t he start there?  Some days it seems to me that contemporary Christianity as we know it gets reduced to a warm fuzzy version of the love part.   Or, maybe more to a small tangent of loving, which is polite, which is calming and not offensive, which is nice.   But Jesus doesn’t start with talking about love.  As much as we may say it is all about loving one another, Jesus does not begin with this interpersonal message.  Instead, he goes bigger: he speaks of life in the public square.  He goes right to the root of what “public” means:  how we order our lives together as a group, how we govern ourselves because of who governs us.  In a time when politics has sharply divided us as a nation, we so want the Jesus story to NOT be about politics.  \\n\\tBut the Gospel of Matthew wants his readers to know that Jesus’ public ministry begins after he hears of a public and politically motivated act against John the Baptist.  Jesus learns that John, his cousin and most likely his spiritual mentor, has been arrested and jailed by the local political ruler King Herod.  Jesus leaves his hometown and heads to Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee.  And, “from that time” on, writes the Gospel of Matthew, “Jesus begins proclaiming ‘repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.’”  Jesus starts with a message about…..politics!  About governance, who is in charge and about how choices are made in this public realm.  He says that the kingdom that rules the heavens, the reign of God, has come near.  Not words that King Herod, nor the Roman empire, would want to hear.  The first public words out his mouth are a radical political proclamation about our life together as a body, polis, community.  And these words will eventually pit him against the political powers of the day and get him arrested and jailed and crucified.   To simply spiritualize these words may put us at a safe distance.  We can speak in generalities about God’s merciful love coming near and making everyone friendly and happy. But we will gain little insight into how in the world we navigate this time in our nation’s history as both citizens and Christians.\\n\\tWe are on the edge of a communally fraught week for our nation: on Monday, we celebrate a national holiday acknowledging the ground breaking  ministry and political proclaiming of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  We do so in an era when racial inequity around housing, jobs, rates of imprisonment and health care, and resulting racial tension, continue to soar.  Dr. King coined the phrase, “the beloved community.”  He spent his public life addressing the interwoven realities of racism, militarism and poverty, which he claimed conspired together to keep our nation from being such a community.  All this, at the height of the Viet Nam War.  On Friday, we will witness the Inauguration of a President whose election continues to cause deep, angry and chaotic divisions in our country.  This is the reality, the context, in which this Matthew passages drops today.\\n\\tThe passage also lands in our Epiphany time, the season after Christmas when the light of Christ becomes an “epiphany,” a “manifestation” to the world.  For the moment, whoever we may have voted for, it just doesn’t seem like there is much light.  I resonated with Walter Bruggeman’s words this week.  He is a retired Hebrew Bible scholar, author of over 70 books, and minister in the United Church of Christ.  Here is the first part of his poem called: “Epiphany.”\\n\\tOn Epiphany day,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0we are still the people walking.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are still people in the dark,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and the darkness looms large around us,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0beset as we are by fear,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0anxiety,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0brutality,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0violence,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0loss —\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0a dozen alienations that we cannot manage.\\n\\nI would say, as a nation and as communities, we still are “people in the dark,” with much darkness looming “large around us.”  With “a dozen alienations that we cannot manage.”  In the midst of all this, we encounter Jesus again, who keeps saying heaven is coming near.  And then he does this very odd thing of going up to a couple of fishermen and saying “follow me, I will make you fishers of people,” and the guys drop everything, I mean everything, and follow him.  Leaving nets and catch and boats and family?  Not a prudent move, it would appear.  What are we to know here, those of us who feel like we are walking in the dark at the moment? \\n\\tJesus begins to proclaim, “repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near, is at hand.”  Actually, this is the same thing John the Baptist has been saying.   It’s a call for a change of heart, a change of behavior.  Why?  Because something has been tripped into motion.  The kingdom of heaven is on the move, so to speak.  The Greek word for kingdom is “baselia” and is translated in a number of different ways.  Which means that Biblical scholars argue a lot about what this means: kingdom, rule, reign, empire.  Throughout Hebrew scriptures, Jews spoke of God the king as creator and savior and judge, and that God’s kingdom/empire is already fully functional in heaven/the unseen realm.  Jews were constantly getting in trouble with the prevailing authorities, the current occupying powers, because of this sense of covenant with, allegiance to, God’s empire.  \\n\\tThe New Testament scholar Warren Carter has written how in first century useage, the word “baselia” also referred “to empires like Rome’s that assert rule over people and land. The Gospel’s use of the same term illustrates a common practice among colonized peoples.”  He notes that people often cope with “imperializing power by using native traditions to redefine its language to produce a similar yet different meaning.”  I see this as a a sly and ultimately subversive approach, often used by the seemingly powerless or marginalized.  We’re going to take back that word, “baselia,” empire, and apply it to God’s empire coming among us!  We see this in the LGBTQ community: we’re going to take back that word “queer” and apply it to ourselves with pride!   In the Matthew passage, Carter continues, the “writer imitates imperial language and structures (God’s dominating power) yet redefines them as the subsequent scene of Jesus’ healing and liberating power displays.”\\n()\\n\\tJesus, the unknown carpenter’s son from Nazareth, wanders in  wandering on the public scene and starts to indirectly talk politics.  One might say, Jesus is referring to regime change.   God’s kingdom, reign of justice, mercy and peace is happening here.  Now.  The “beloved community” God intends is at hand, it draws near.  Jesus is going to start acting like his very presence, his teaching, his healing work, extends this regime change and reveals it.  And who does he invite to join him first?  Fishermen.  Not the local bakers, artisans or tax collectors.  All three gospels, Matthew, Luke and Mark, tell us his first students, followers, are fishermen.  This is significant because the fishing industry of the time was more fully embedded in the imperial Roman economy that just about anything else.  Warren Carter describes how “Rome asserted control over the land and sea, their production, and the transportation and marketing of their yields with contracts and taxes.”  Boats, nets, your catch, where you pulled up your boat, who you sold to, prices, all regulated by the empire who also takes a huge cut.  Professor Carter continues: “Jesus disrupts these men’s lives, calls them to a different loyalty and way of life, creates a new community, and gives them a new mission (fish for people). His summons exhibits God’s empire at work, this light shining in the darkness of Roman-ruled Galilee.”  Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.  Now we move to the relational, the building of this beloved community.  It’s going to be about how we live together, govern ourselves under God’s rule.\\n\\tCarter also notes that Jesus will go on and heal people who have actually been physically damaged by living in the inequities of the Roman imperial system.  At least 70-90% of the inhabitants of the region were living in poverty.  Food insecurity, unclean drinking water, social stress, poor nutrition, frequent imprisonment and hard physical labor just to survive.  Many of the illnesses that Jesus will cure are caused by these kinds of unjust conditions: body weakness and paralisis, blindness, mental instability, fevers.  Professor Carter bluntly puts it this way: Jesus comes and starts to “repair imperial damage.”  Jesus “enacts God’s life-giving empire.”   When I read this, all of a sudden the healing stories of Jesus seemed more radical, more seditious, than I ever imagined.  I also realized how closely these conditions of first century people’s lives parallels that of people of color in this nation today.\\n\\tMartin Luther King, Jr. called our nation to repair “imperial damage” of centuries of racism, militarism and poverty.  And it was very hard for much of our nation to hear him.  And the damage continues.  How will we be about “damage repair” in the next four years?  Let’s keep talking and praying about this.  The rest of Walter Bruggeman’s poem is a starting point, as we begin this significant week:\\n\\tWe are — we could be — people of your light.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0So we pray for the light of your glorious presence\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0as we wait for your appearing;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0we pray for the light of your wondrous grace\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0as we exhaust our coping capacity;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0we pray for your gift of newness that\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0will override our weariness;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0we pray that we may see and know and hear and trust in your good rule.\\nThat we may have energy, courage, and freedom to enact\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 your rule through the demands of this day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We submit our day to you and to your rule, with deep joy and high hope.\\nAnd so may it be.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOne of our long-time members emailed me the other day, asking if I was aware that several students of this year’s Confirmation class are 5th and 6th generation family members here at Immanuel Church.  How amazing and wonderful, I thought as I read this!  There is something both unusual and heart-warming in thinking about some of our young people carrying a family tradition of joining Immanuel and welcoming the adult challenges and joys of being part of this particular community of faith.    I have delighted in hearing stories some of you tell about your parents and grand-parents involvement during the early years of this congregation.  I have learned this much in my 20 months of serving this congregation and living in Dorchester County:  family connections are deeply valued in this part of the country.  Many people choose to live here their whole lives so they can stay close with their extended families, traditions and livelihoods.   Many times here in this congregation I have heard people say: this church feels like “one big family.”  We celebrate this sense of familiarity, of belonging, of continuity.  \\n\\tThese feelings reflect some of what we long for in our connection with God:  being connected to something bigger than our individual selves, being part of something welcoming and known, tied to some constancy of tradition handed down through generations. \\n\\tSo it may be a bit startling for us to hear this passage from the Gospel of Mark.  It is early in his public ministry, and Jesus has just returned to his home town after a busy time of preaching in the synagogues, healing, doing exorcisms, choosing disciples he will mentor and teach.  Already, huge crowds of people are following him from town to town, pressing in on him. The local religious authorities have quickly become critical of his teachings and healings.   Jesus is pushing them to consider the heart of Jewish law, where God is always more interested in addressing suffering and challenging inequality and injustice.   We can imagine how tired, overwhelmed and depleted Jesus may have felt as he entered the house of his family.   His mother Mary, his older father Joseph having died, and some siblings.  But does Jesus get a big warm family welcome?  No.  They have gotten news of the crowds, his challenging teachings, his healings of those out on the margins of society, and they are not pleased.  “Mom,” his siblings could well have pleaded, “what is up with our crazy brother?  First he runs after our cousin John the Baptizer, now this?  He’s becoming an embarrassment to our family!” \\n\\tThe casting out of demons may have been the last straw for them,  opening Jesus up to accusations that he worked for evil forces.   Seeing his fatigue and overwhelm, his mother, brothers and sisters are convinced he has lost his marbles.  They set out to restrain him, or as the original Greek says more strongly to seize, to arrest him.   This can’t end well, but the Gospel writer plunges on to describe Jesus’ other immediate problem.\\n\\tThe religious scribes have become particularly snarky in their accusations of Jesus’ ministry.  They insist he is possessed by a pagan Syrian God Beelzebul, whose name meant “Lord of the House,”  the head of the house of evil.  “That’s how Jesus casts out demons, he is in league with the Head Demon!”   Jesus catches them in their confused logic:  “wait, how can Satan, evil, cast out Satan?”  No, evil is not self-destructing here because “a house divided against itself will not stand.”  Then Jesus tells this parable snippet of someone plundering the strong man’s house, (a play on Beezlelbul, Lord of the house).  Suddenly we realize Jesus is talking about himself.  He will plunder the evil one’s house!  I suggest we drop the later idea of a red devil with horns and pitchfork from the Middle Ages.  Jesus is speaking of the wider forces of evil, having confronted their temptations in the desert early in his ministry.  He knows people get possessed by all kinds of corruptive powers:  mental confusion, yes, but also crippling shame, the incessant pursuit of money and fame, seething resentments, obsessive anxiety and excruciating memories, even wishful thinking.  Jesus is here to plunder the House inhabited by evil of all kinds and is intent on tying up the strong man in the process.   So much for Jesus “meek and mild.”  He is here to confront evil, in people and in society.  He is here to help us change and to work together to change our world.\\n\\tHis family doesn’t seem to get who he is or what he is doing.  The same goes for the religious authorities.  He is crazy.  He is possessed by Satan.  There is something about the way Jesus reimagines God’s intentions for humans that is really unsettling for people.  What are we to make of this?\\n\\tBack to family for a moment.  And the church as family.  We may need to consider the general discussion about “Biblical family values,” a phrase which is bandied around quite a lot these days.  Matthew Skinner teaches at a Lutheran seminary in St. Paul, and writes about family values, contemporary culture, technology and Christian faith.  His web-blog this last week included this: “the Bible is not a good choice for happy family snaphots.”  Now, family kinships in Biblical times were certainly strong, gave people a sense of identity and, generally, protection in a hostile and unpredictable world.  Yet, the first sin recounted in Genesis is not Adam and Eve eating the apple, but is Cain killing Able.  The first time “sin” is mentioned it is God’s denunciation of sibling violence: a farmer killing his sheepherder brother.  Biblical family violence escalates from there and it continues to break God’s heart.  A father offers his son as a living sacrifice and others offer their daughters for their dinner guests’ pleasure-taking. Not all Biblical marriages look cozily familiar either. King David stole someone else’s wife and had her husband murdured.  A number of Israel’s Kings had numerous wives and a hundreds of concubines. It makes me wonder sometimes what is meant by “the sanctity of Biblical marriage.”   \\n\\tBut kinship ties continued to be close and defining in Jesus’ time.  The way Jesus speaks of his family would have been as startling to his own listeners as it is to us today.  After tussling with the religious leaders, the crowd pressing around him reports that his family is outside the house, asking for him.   I can almost hear him sigh, and quietly but firmly reply:  “who are my mother and my siblings?  Here they are! (looking at the crowd around him)  Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”   \\n\\tWhat do we make of this?  Family connections are not important?  For starters, we might be careful about our assumptions of what family life should look like.  Jesus seems to be expanding the traditional definition of family to a wider web of relationships.  True family are those who seek to partner with God to bring about God’s reign of love, compassion and justice.  Matt Skinner asks, “Can only certain kinds of families reflect and promote God’s will?”  Can only certain family configurations teach children about mercy, love, protection, God’s grace, justice and human well-being?   Jesus is always drawing the circle of inclusion wider than we might expect.  How wide do we draw the circle of who is a family?\\n\\tThe final piece we might consider is how we talk about “family” in the church.  The purpose of the church is to change us, to transform both individuals and society so we can become more Christ-like.  When we speak of the church as being like “family” we are trying to speak about a sense of welcome and closeness.  But we are not a club.  We might remember that families are not always easy to join, either by marriage or just going to someone else’s family reunion where you don’t know the people or the stories.  When newcomers hear “our church is a family” sometimes what they hear is “our church is for families…only!”  Even in celebrating our graduates today, we recognize that some have long-time family connections to this church.  And others are newcomers or are not related to anyone here!   I heard another pastor say this week (Tony Robinson’s blog) that we might want to be careful about our church “family” assumptions.  Does this keep us focused solely on the “comfort and satisfaction of the members?”  Jesus called people to something more than comfort and satisfaction.  As the church, we are about “growing people of faith,” we are here to help “people and communities move from despair to hope.”  We are about inviting people to act just crazy enough to follow Jesus.  This Jesus who is out in front of us.  To join in this ever-wider reality of what it means to be part of the larger family of God.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n ',\n",
       " 'Sermon Series on The Lord’s Prayer: Part 3\\n\\nDuring the weeks of Lent, the reflective season before Easter, we are taking another look at the Lord’s Prayer, taught by Jesus to his disciples.  In thinking about God the Father, we’ve considered an image of God as the Divine Head of the World Household. As a just and merciful Householder, God looks after God’s whole house to see that everyone, even the most vulnerable, get enough.  We have considered how we are called to be co-workers, partners in helping heal the broken House of God’s world.  Today, we move into the nitty-gritty of how life should go in God’s House of the World.  “Give us this day our daily bread.”  Or, as the paraphrase by John Philip Newell, a minister and writer from Scotland goes, “May there be food for the human family today and for the whole earth community.”  \\nGive us this day our daily bread.  Jesus may have held up a piece of bread that looked something like the round flat pita loaf we use for Communion at Immanuel.  What kind of “bread” do you picture in your mind’s eye as you hear this petition?  I love dark, multi-grain bread now as an adult.  But when I pray this part of the Lord’s Prayer, I can’t help but think of the squishy white sliced marvel of my childhood: Wonder Bread!  How my sister and I loved to tear off the crust and mush it into a ball, which we would slowly nibble as we wandered the neighborhood.  Give us this day our daily bread.  How do we hear those words, those of us some 2000 years after Jesus spoke them to his followers?  \\nThe other day the Confirmation Class and I were talking about what life was like for everyday people around the time Jesus appeared on the scene.  \\nFor the last couple of months we have been working our way through a book called Manna and Mercy, which describes the Biblical story in sort of a graphic novel format.  Not with cartoons, exactly, but the drawings include some pretty humorous takes on the ups and downs of Jews and Christians in their life in covenant with Almighty God.  Written by a Lutheran pastor from Seattle, Manna and Mercy describes how God’s intention is that there be enough manna, food, for everyone within a just society that reflects God’s mercy.  (Great book; let me know if you would like to see it or even order a copy.)  The author describes that the Biblical story is about the humans longing for and struggling with God’s intention for the world:  the idea that everyone should get enough, and some folks are going to need some help in even getting the basics (think orphans, widows, frail elders, slaves and young children: the vulnerable).  Back to our class:  it’s been a crash course in ancient history as we have wended our way through Old Testament times, following our Jewish ancestors up to the time of Jesus, year 1 AD.  The Roman Empire has spread across and around the Mediterranean, and we have struggled to really imagine this, living in an open and free society as we do here in American.  At that time, Rome was building roads, collecting taxes, taking away peoples land, imposing tariffs especially on the prevelent fishing industry, and greatly restricting Jewish movement, cultural life and religious observance.  As Rome conscripted soldiers and urbanized Palestine, it made it more commericially profitably for those in power, and less so for everyone else, like the local fishermen.  Everyone is under Rome’s thumb, the general idea is that the Roman emperor is God and the tone within the Jewish community is tense.   The well-to-do land-rich Sadducees, the priestly class who preside over the Temple services and rituals, curry Roman favor.  The Phraisees, teaches of the Jewish law, get all tangled up in trying to maintain Jewish identity with strict adherence to purity codes.  Who is ritually clean?  Who is ritually impure?  And other groups of Jews are fed up with the whole mess, and figure it is about time for God’s reign to be re-instated, by the power of the sword.  Revolutionaries, Zealots they were called.  \\n\\tThis is the context for Jesus’ prayer that he teaches his disciples, which we have been exploring these last few weeks.  We need to keep in mind that this is a tinderbox.  “Give us this day our daily bread,” Jesus tells his followers to pray.  Sounds simple enough, almost a polite and really quite reasonable request.   No harm in simply teaching people to ask for their daily bread.  Given the Jewish background of the Exodus story we heard today, the story of God providing just enough manna or bread for each day during their 40 year journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, this part of the prayer makes a tidy circle.  Just pray for this day….don’t get greedy.  Okay, we get it….on to the next part of the prayer! \\n\\tJohn Dominic Crossan is a New Testament scholar who has worked with this prayer for years.  He writes that this part of the prayer, which seems so simple and even innocent, may be the most dangerous part of Jesus teaching.  “Jesus dies not for demanding charity or generosity of hospitality,” says Crossan.  “He dies because he insists the world and its food belong to God and not Rome.”   Over and over, Jesus would use both bread and fish, taking, blessing, breaking, giving bread and fish….enacting in front of everyone a parable of God as Householder of the world.  Not the Emperor of Rome, but God.\\nBut for starters, most of us here today have bread, and fish if we want it, and a whole lot of other food choices. The majority of us in this town, not everyone, but most, have boxed and canned food on our shelves, fresh produce, meat and dairy in our refrigerator.   We have food-pantries for those in need.  We live in a society where grocery stores are basically accessible and well stocked with more choices than we could ever try in a lifetime.   Some among us have experienced real hunger at some point, but probably not recently.  Few of us have actually lived among the poor for any amount of time.  Food is so plentiful and over-consumed that we live in culture of fad diets, rising obesity and diet-related diabetes.   And some popular diets suggest that bread is fattening and bad for us.   Perhaps we should pray “keep us away from our daily bread!”   \\n\\tGather as much as you need, said God to the Israelites, to the Jewish community wandering in the desert.  What do I want, what do I really need?  In a world where enough food is grown, 800 million people are hungry each day.  30-35,000 people will die today of hunger-related illnesses around the world, as they do each day of the year.  I wander the aisle of the supermarket and wonder to myself, what do I want, what do I need, what is enough? \\n\\t God the Householder of the World wants food security, enough bread and fish, for everyone. If your child is starving, you become insecure, angry and desperate.  What a difference true “food security” would make in diminishing frustration and violence around the world.  People here in Cambridge are having to make choices between paying a utility bill and buying groceries.  Between paying for medicine or paying for milk and bread.  And as hard as it is for us to imagine, many of these people are already working several jobs. \\n\\tAnd finally, these simple words also connect us to Jesus himself. Jesus refered to himself as bread.  Jesus spoke of the “bread of God which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”  “Oh!” cried his listeners, “sir, give us this bread always!”  And Jesus replied, “I am the bread of life.  Whoever comes to me will never be hungry.”   “Take and eat, for this is my body broken for you,” Jesus will soon say as he breaks and blesses a chunk of bread at the Last Supper.   His body will soon be broken, and in some wild, mysterious way this will enable God’s eternal and ever-present grace to break out among us in a new way.    O God, we pray:  give us daily bread, and daily give us Jesus. Give us the One whose daily presence nourishes and energizes us to not just get what we need.   Give us this “bread of life” so we may “be bread” for others.  Amen. \\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'As we wonder about this together, I suggest we sing the first verse of the hymn, “Blest be the tie that binds,” written by a Baptist minister for his parish of farmers and sheep herders in 18th century Wainsgate, England.   “Blest be the tie that binds, our hearts in Christian love.  The fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above.”   It has occurred to me in these last four months of serving as your Transitional Pastor, that the “fellowship of kindred minds” has had a rough go around here.  Many human “bonds and ties” among you have frayed, and some have actually been snapped.  I would imagine that for some of you, your sense of connection, of being tied to God, has also been challenged in the midst of all this.  A pastor resigned and lay leadership has changed and shifted. Some longtime members have left.  People are uncertain and anxious about the church’s financial and spiritual future.  In such times, we yearn for ties that will support and sustain us:  ties and bonds that are like the best parts of loving families, of happy marriages, of deep friendships and of a vital and healthy church communities.  \\n\\tBut as we look closer at the scriptures passages for today, we might notice that there also can exist ties that bind us up.  They entangle us, tie us up in ways that make it difficult for us to be the individuals and that church that God might be calling us to be.  There are ties that can bind a church community up, so it is no longer able to respond with openness and courage and creativity to God’s new call in its midst.  Jeremiah hears God asking him to preach against the political and ethical corruption of his day, to speak truth to power during a time of tremendous political and religious turmoil in the 600’s BCE in Israel.  He is told to speak not just to the Hebrew kings, but to actually call the threatening foreign nations of Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia to restructure themselves.  Not an enviable job description.  Jeremiah’s response is similar to Moses when confronted by God’s voice in the burning bush:  “uh, I don’t think so, God…I don’t even know how to speak!”  Jeremiah just doesn’t have the experience or the authority for this audacious, prophetic call; “God, what are you thinking?  I’m only a youth!”   \\n\\tSound familiar?  Perhaps there was a time when you had a certain perception of your abilities and you found yourself resisting a call to greater responsibility?  “No, I can’t possibly do that…I’m not experienced enough, educated enough; I’m not good at that, I’m shy, I’m only a newcomer, I’m just an amateur.”  How often do we let our insecurities tie us up?   Certainly people can get tied up in thinking they are better than anyone else, that they can do no wrong.  But we can also get tied up thinking we are inadequate, or even worse than everyone else, believing that deep down inside we are wrongness itself.  Either way we can get stuck in thinking we are better or worse than the rest of the human race.  Jeremiah’s limited view of himself bound him up and was keeping him from responding to God’s call.  “I will be with you,” God promised.  “I will direct your speech…come on, Jeremiah, get ready for action!”  \\n\\tI wonder if we can also get tied up in a sense of hopelessness about a given situation.  We just can’t seem to move into a place of curiosity about the future, we lose a sense of hope that things might change.  We can’t seem to develop a new future story for how things might be different, and how we can help this happen.  I see this happening on the wider political scene in our country and I’ve heard some it around here at our church.  This is why it is so important to me to be part of regular worship and scripture soaking, as a follower of Jesus.  Part of what we can do on the Sabbath, in worship together, is to re-imagine what might be possible in our own individual lives. We hear the witness of scripture, we experience God’s loving and transforming presence, and we become more receptive to who we might become.  In worship, we get pushed beyond simply appreciating the human ties between us.  Our imaginations get stretched to consider the wider container of God’s creative life force, God’s compassion and concern for us.     This is different from just coming to worship to be spiritually uplifted or emotionally soothed, although those things can happen to.  It’s about putting ourselves in the position, at least once a week, to be challenged to perceive the world differently.  To understand it as God might be perceiving and working in it.  Perhaps even to see where we, groups of people, family systems and church communities, can have ties that sometimes bind us in a negative way.   \\nMy sense is that Jesus noticed these problematic ties, these constricting bonds, in people.    This seems to be what is going on in this story from the Gospel of Luke.  We are not quite sure what is wrong with this woman Jesus sees in the synagogue that morning during worship.  She is described as being “bent over and quite unable to stand up straight.” Whatever it was, in the early 1st century such a physical ailment was understood to be the work of evil forces.   Evil forces were seen as tying this woman up, binding her and keeping her stuck bent over.  Jesus, without being asked, simply pronounces that she is “set free” or literally “untied.”  The woman stands up straight and immediately starts praising God.  But notice what happens next:  the local religious leader is irked.  Jesus has done his “unbinding,” his liberating, of the woman on the Sabbath.  But why was this a problem?  \\nThroughout Biblical and modern history, Sabbath laws have been a central and defining characteristic of the Jewish way of life.  They provided for much needed rest and rejuvenation of people down through the centuries.  The people would remember that God rested on the seventh day of creation, and also commanded them to keep this day holy in remembrance of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt.  The observance was so important for their communal identity, that by Jesus’ time, the Jewish tradition had become a bit bound up in many different rules about what you could and could not do on the Sabbath.  Jesus argues with the synagogue leader and says, “you would untie an animal who needed to be led to water, why shouldn’t I untie this woman from the bounds of evil?” Apparently, certain kinds of knots were exempt on the Sabbath, and you could untie them if needed. The woman’s healing and the metaphor of unbinding challenged the wider religious institution to “unbind” itself! \\nMight there be some “ties” that are binding this congregation and keeping it from moving into God’s future?  Are we stuck in wanting to return to some golden era of ministry that might not fit the current ministry needs?  These are things we can explore together in the interim period, before you form a pastoral search committee to find a new pastor.  Just like Jeremiah, congregations, can minimize their gifts, abilities and potential.  Some ties are blest, and some just bind us up.  Our Sabbath work is to open to God’s guidance in perceiving the difference.\\nThis will be the task of the newly created Discovery Team, to guide you in some “unbinding,” even as you discover the healthy ties that hold you together in Christian love.  The plan is for the Discovery Team to use our Sabbath, Sunday mornings to lead you all through both small group listening and shared feedback experiences, to explore who you have been as a church, what you value and believe now, who is your neighbor that you may be called to serve at this point in time, and what might God be calling you all to do next?   As this diverse Discovery Team begins to meet, it will be involved in some important reconciliation work of its own, seeking to listen to, be curious about and better understand one another.  To consider the helpful, and maybe unhelpful ties that are binding them at this point, as they begin their wider work with all of you. \\t\\nI encourage you to join us in worship for this Sabbath work, as often as you can during this interim period of transition. We will soak in the scriptures and pray and sing together and this Sabbath work will help us imagine a new future story for this church.   I invite us to be patient with the interim process, to pray for our ministry together. I ask that you be honest with me about how you experience my leadership.  Know that I am here with you, with gratitude and hopefulness for all that we will experience in this time of transition together.   The ties between us will only grow and strengthen, and God will use those connections for an unknown future that lies ahead of us.  Thanks be to God! Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tWe move deeper into the season of Advent in the church.  The darkening days, the quiet chill of the snow-covered woods and fields, frame our reflective spiritual practices as we approach Christmas.  In weekly worship, the “rhythm of the liturgical year breaks us open to the divine” among us.  (Chittister)  We pause from holiday preparations to consider a wider view.  News from across our nation and around the globe might easily sink us into fear, anxiety and grievances.  As followers of Jesus we are challenged to envision a deeper reality and to engage that transformative reality in every corner of our lives.   In worship, we are reminded of how we need the redemptive presence of God’s mercy, justice and peace.  Of how much we long for God to be truly coming to us, when our world is filled with such violence, inequality and despair!  This morning, our scripture passages and the flow Mozart’s Credo invite us to draw further into this sense of expectancy and hope of God’s “perpetual coming to us.” (Evelyn Underhill’s phrase, from Advent with Evelyn Underhill, edited by Christopher L. Webber).\\n\\tThe Hebrew prophet Malachi speaks to us of God’s purifying presence, coming first upon the priests of the 500 BCE Temple leadership in Jerusalem, and then upon the people themselves.  We might notice that Malachi moves beyond issues of personal morality to the wider transgressions of the nation.  Hired workers wages are being treated unfairly, vulnernable widows and orphans are not being cared for, the alien/regufees are being “trust aside.”  The people no longer approach God in awe and respect.  How do we as a nation hear these words?\\n\\tOver 500 years later, the Gospel writer Luke speaks of the arrival of another prophet who will speak truth to power, John the Baptist.  Luke describes how this messanger will appear in the historical context of an oppressive political and religious hierarchy: Roman emperor, the fith prefect of the region of Judea, two local governors, two Temple leaders.  Each are named specifically so Luke’s readers won’t miss the point: God enters human history.  Now faced with another occupying force of the Roman Empire, the people again suffer under oppressive and often arbitrary rule from all of those named.  John the Baptist will challenge the people of Jerusalem and their leaders to repent of their self-focus and their avoidance of the needs of the poor and marginalized.  “Repent,” “change your mind and heart” he calls, “and make way for the One who will come and transform this hurting world!”  John called people to be baptized in water as a sign of their openness to God’s transforming action in their lives.  Then and now, repentance is our acknowledgement that we are cherished for who we are, but that we are also accountable for what we do. \\n \\tBoth the affirmation of our precious nature as children of God, and our accountability in that relationship with the creator of the universe, is a deep part of our worship tradition.  The liturgy, the order of worship, within our reformed Protestant tradition no longer follows each portion of the Eastern Orthodox or Roman Catholic Mass. But the confessional tone and words of praise in Mozart’s piece echo much of our spiritual yearnings and worship practice today.  It is fitting that we celebrate this work today, with John the Baptist’s  call to “repent” and to “prepare” echoing in our minds. \\n\\n\\tMozart’s piece begins with the Kyrie.  The word “Kyrie” is used over 740 times in the Greek New Testament, mostly referring to Jesus.  It means “Lord, Master.”  This is the only piece of Greek in this Mass set in Latin, a vestige from the early years when all the church’s liturgies were in Greek.  “Lord, have mercy on me.”  The Gospel writer Luke lists numerous powerful leaders, all of whom will “lord” power over others; Caesar himself will demand to be called Lord.  The early Christians will face perilous opposition because they address their teacher Jesus as Lord.  “Lord, have mercy on me.”  This will be the core of John the Baptist’s message:  in our humanness, our need for mercy.   In our pride, our over-identification with our productivity, our need for God’s transforming spirit working within us…loving, healing, guiding us into new beings. \\n\\n\\tThe Gloria is a celebratory passage praising God the Creator, the Parent of all (here described as “Father”) and Christ.  It begins with the words found in Gospel writer Luke’s record of the angels’ song to the shepherds, as they heralded the baby Jesus’ birth (Luke 2:14). \\n\\t The Credo is a setting of the Nicene Creed (check this), a statement agreed upon by church leaders in the 4th century as they struggled to define the nature of Jesus.  There was a serious disagreement among church leaders and writers in the second and third century about Jesus’ human nature.   Taking a dim view of human nature, some refused to believe that God would dwell in a supposedly “defiled” human body.   Wiser minds prevailed, insisting that God cherishes creation and became incarnate in humanity:  Jesus is fully divine and fully human, the symbolic language of the Nicene Creed affirmed.\\n\\tThe\\xa0\\xa0is a doxology or song of praise.  It is the final words of preface to the\\xa0 in both the Catholic Mass and in our own Communion Service.  Here in our celebration of Communion at Falcon Heights Church, we sing these  joyful words praising the Trinity to a lilting Argentinian tune:  “Holy, holy, holy, my heart, my heart adores you!  My heart is glad to say the words, you are holy God,” we sing as a congregation.  The Sanctus in Mozart’s Credo Mass, describes us joining with the\\xa0, who are pictured as praising God with their song. \\n\\n\\tWe close with the “Agnus Dei.”  This part of the Mass is based upon John the Baptist’s reference (recorded in\\xa0)\\xa0to Jesus, when Jesus approaches him for baptism: \"behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.”  The Agnus Dei is the invocation to the Lamb of God sung during the breaking of the bread during the Eucharist, or Holy Communion.  “Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.”\\n\\tLet us prepare our hearts and minds to receive this music.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tWe have come to the final request of the Lord’s Prayer: “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.”  The prayer continues with closing words of praise, that were probably added by the early church and used in worship together.  But Jesus ended the prayer here, focused on some of the more troubling aspects of our human condition:  temptation, trial, evil.   For me, it raises difficult questions questions about why and how we mess up, hurt ourselves and others, why we sin.  And whose responsibility is it to corral and subdue evil in the world?  Is it God’s job to get rid of evil?  If we are God’s partners in healing God’s worldwide Household, what of this is our job?  How does God “keep us from evil; keep our going out and our coming in” as the Psalmist of our Hebrew scriptures claimed?\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t“Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil.” When I was a child, my younger sister and I had a small picture book about the Lord’s Prayer.  The book was filled with lovely water-color paintings meant to catch a child’s attention; the illustration I remember most clearly went with this passage we are considering today.  Picture in your mind’s eye an outdoor scene with trees and grass, and a small group of children starting to climb over a split-rail fence.  On the other side of the fence is an apple tree; its leafy branches are heavy with ripe red fruit.  Ah…forbidden fruit!   An angel-type figure is standing next to the children with its arms raised.  I could never quite figure this one out: was the angel trying to stop the kids from the illegal deed of apple-stealing?  Was the angel enticing them to pick the apples and God was supposed to stop them?   All I remember is some vague notion about God wanting me not to be naughty.\\n\\t\\n\\tA child’s perspective.  And I’m afraid it models an unfortunate adult approach to moral behavior and God’s power in our lives.  Please God, help me be a good person!   We often assume temptation or trial is just about individual morality.  So we pray, “God, help me not eat that extra piece of pie; God, help me not have an affair while my spouse is out of town; God, help me not cheat on my income taxes; God help me stay off those internet web sites that are full of all kinds of virtual temptation.”  Sometimes the purpose of Christianity gets reduced to “Preventing Individual Naughtiness.”  And God becomes “The Great Dispenser of Discipline.”   We start to assume we get punished if we are naughty and rewarded if we are nice.  \\t\\n\\tNaughty, nice.  Right, wrong.  Punishment, reward.   Pretty simple; childlike, in a way.   But I find I need a more mature perspective on my ability to sin as an individuals, on our sinfulness as church systems, institutions and nations.  This naughty/nice, punishment/reward, perspective makes Jesus’ message easy to reject, or simply ignore, when we are no longer children.  Particularly when we become teenagers. Teenagers, if they are developing naturally, often feel a tad defiant towards most types of authority (parents, school, police, church).   Adolescence is a time when many of us start questioning ideas and answers; we take all kinds of risks (publically or privately), trying to see what we are made of; we suddenly want to explore for ourselves just what is right and wrong.  We don’t want to just accept our parents’ beliefs as our own; we want to experience God and morality for ourselves. Unfortunately, some people stay stuck in this adolescent view through much of their lives:  “I don’t need anyone to tell me what to do! I’m in control of my own life!  I can take care of myself; I’m not dependent on anyone!”   And even if we do hold onto this view of God as the Great Enforcer of Proper Behavior into adulthood, we end up resenting it at some level.  If our good behavior isn’t rewarded, we may feel unjustly treated in some way.  “Hey, I behaved myself and didn’t get my reward of good health and prosperity!”  “My mother is a good person, why should she get sick?”  “My friend is so loving and ethical, why did he loose his job?”    \\n\\tEither way, we can end up missing the point of Jesus’ message: We are created to be coworkers with God in healing the world Household of God, to take responsibility for our own behavior and not expect rewards and punishments. \\n\\tWhat might have been Jesus’ original meaning here in this part of the prayer?  The Greek word in the Lord’s Prayer that is translated as temptation can also mean trial or test.  And there is probably no better place to understand what Jesus was talking about here, than to look at the time when Jesus himself was sorely tempted, put to the test:  What we call the “temptations in the wilderness,” when Jesus retreated for a time of prayer and fasting right after his baptism in the Jordan River by John at the beginning of his public ministry.  Inner dialogue or confrontation with an external evil entity?  We are not sure.  Matthew describes that the tempter puts it to Jesus:  “Hey, you must be hungry: doesn’t God provide manna for all?  Satisfy your own hunger: Turn these stones into bread.  No? Well, how about something alittle more public, come up to the top of the top pinnacle tower of the Jerusalem Temple and jump and let’s give the folks a display of miraculous power!  No?  Okay (continues the tempter) How about dominion over all the world powers?  You keep saying the Kingdom of God is at hand!  Let’s bring it on, Jesus!  Let’s smash these human powers and bring God’s reign in by force!”  Jesus refuses; the tempter departs.\\nRemember Jesus’ historical context:  Jesus had grown up in Nazareth after a huge military incursion of Roman legions in 4 BC, which brutally squashed violent rebellions among the Jewish people.   Roman power continues to oppress the people, demanding excessive taxes, military service, and most repugnant, worshipping Caesar as God.  How very tempting to think that more violence might be the answer.   Perhaps this is the toughest challenge in this prayer and in Jesus’ teachings: again and again Jesus will refuse violence as the way to bring in the Kingdom, the Reign, of God.\\n\\tThere are Biblical scholars who say that humans’ original sin was not the disobedience of eating fruit from a tree in the Garden of Eden.  They point to the first time the word “sin” is used in Hebrew scriptures of the Old Testament: the Cain and Abel story.  These two sons of Adam and Eve story were strong rivals.  Cain ended up killing his brother.  In response, God warns, for the first time, of “sin lurking at their door.”  What was the sin?  Escalating violence that seeks not just to defend but to retaliate.  And escalatory violence was starting to look pretty tempting to many of those under Roman imperial oppression in the first century during Jesus time and Jesus knew it was a dead end.  \\n\\tI think of difficult times I have been through in my life, times when I had the choice between depending upon my own limited understanding and human strength, flailing around…. or working with God to figure out what God was calling me to next in the middle of the mess.  Think of one of your own times of trial and testing in your family or this church’s history.  Have we been reactive and destructive as we struggled to cope?  How tempting to resort to defensiveness, impatience and arrogance, passivity and hurtful gossip, angry words.  These are all forms of escalating violence, that are damaging even without physical blows.  How tempting for nations to persistently use escalatory violence as a way to solve conflict around the globe.  Jesus will command his followers to put away their swords when he is confronted by Roman soldiers in the Garden of Gethsemene.   The church in each generation has got to grapple with the implications of Jesus’ call to non-violence. A difficult challenge in a world where evil persists and there are never easy answers or simple solutions.\\n\\tThe curious thing about times of crisis, trial and testing is that while they can break us, they have the curious potential to change us.  Do I see myself as a passive recipient of God’s rewards and punishments?  Do I rely on my own insight and strength?  Or do I reach out to God and to others in these times?  Do I acknowledge my part in the mess; recognize and confess my sins, repent and change my ways?  Individual and group character can be tempered and shaped in such times.   \\n\\tTimes of trial, temptation and test present us with a moment of choice.   For some reason, God has placed us in a world that is both beautiful and dangerous, filled with wonder and resources and unpredictability.   This is our life.  Where will we each face temptation this week?  Be on the alert.  Know that we are free to work with God, to resist evil, to help heal the world and delight in it together.  And so we are urged to pray, “lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tAnyone who does laundry on a regular basis knows the agony of the lost sock.  You’re folding the dry shirts and sheets, glad to have gotten this far once again in an endless repeating cycle of clean clothes getting dirty again.  And there it is:  another darn sock without it’s match.  Actually, the lost sock is not really the problem.  What is now troublesome is this now “left-over” sock.  Leftover glove or mitten, saucer without its teacup, a metal nut without a matching size bolt. There is a “forlorn lostness” to this now solo item, or so it seems as we try and figure out just what to do with it.   Funny how these seemingly trivial, everyday circumstances around our home can sometimes put us in touch with deep feelings and wonderings.  We might be reminded of other lost things and broken pairs in our life.  Like a friendship or a marriage.  An adult child who seldom calls anymore, or a beloved church member who drifted away and stopped coming to worship.  Memories get snagged and we suddenly find ourselves mulling over the realities that run below the surface of our everyday lives: times when we ourselves have felt lost, or seem to have lost a part of ourselves.  What was it that went missing?  A lost opportunity, a sense of eager curiosity, a feeling that God really was there for us, a trust in someone, a certainty our abilities or our future?   \\nJesus of Nazareth had an uncanny ability to recognize and search out lostness; people lost to themselves, people lost to their communities.  He wanted people to know that lostness matters to God; God somehow knows and aches with all this human lostness, isolation, disconnection, separation.  Maybe that’s why Jesus hung out with lost people and frequently ate with them.  Tax collectors and sinners, notes the Gospel writer Luke.  \\n The context for the two parables we just heard is the grumbling and complaining of some local religious leaders in reaction to Jesus’ practice of eating with “tax collectors and sinners.” The Pharisees and scribes, religious leaders of Jesus’ time, had become increasingly disturbed by the way Jesus interacted with all kinds of people who were considered to be breaking the guiding principles of their communities, the Jewish law.  These rules may seem foreign or even ridiculous to us, but Jesus was breaking what was know as the Jewish purity code by hanging out and eating with corrupt petty officials, people with deformities and illness, and sex workers.  The Pharisees and scribes are not just pietistic prigs: they have the well being of the whole community to consider, with the suspicious and repressive occupying Roman enforcers always to close at hand.   So these understandably concerned religious leaders are debating and grousing among themselves.  Jesus overhears them and starts telling these two parables about lost-and-found.\\nThese are disarmingly simple stories about pretty trivial items: one single sheep and one small coin.  But they are sort of odd, as stories go.  “Which one of you would not leave your whole flock; what woman wouldn’t use up lamp oil to find one small coin?” Jesus asks the crowd.  What he suggests is something that actually few of us would do.  What kind of smart herder risks loosing a whole flock to find one lamb?  The image is over-the-top; it doesn’t make sense. And a shepherd is certainly an unlikely role model for God who searches for the lost.  In that era, shepherds were considered shiftless and dishonest, dirty and ritually impure.  Shepherd finds the lost sheep and yells to his guy friends, “let’s rejoice!” which is Aramaic for “let’s party,” and most likely he kills a few sheep to roast in celebration! The next story is just as exaggerated.  Woman looses coin valued at about one days labor.  Uses up precious lamp oil and time to search her house.  Finds the coin and invites her girl friends to “rejoice” whereby they all start partying in celebration.  The Lord God of the universe is like a persistently searching shepherd, like a diligently searching woman?  That sounds preposperous.  On top of this, Jesus eats with these people and now he is implying that God not only searches for the lost, the misfits, the marginalized in our society, but God wants to feast in an extravagant and seemingly wasteful manner.  No wonder the religious leaders found Jesus irritating.\\nAccording to Jesus, God is out there searching for the lost; persistently looking, not waiting for those on the margins to be included but actually seeking them out.  Not waiting for us in our own disoriented sense of “lostness” to finally get it that we could have a closer connection to the Creator of the Universe, but actively pursuing us.  Wondering about us, searching for us, reaching for us.  \\nWhat does it feel like to be subject to this kind of search?   Do you find it reassuring….. or does it creep you out to think of God searching for you?  We talk a lot in the liberal church about how we welcome all seekers, and how important our own individual search for God and truth and mystery is.   We want to make sure we have the freedom to seek out God on our own terms, without someone telling us what that search should go or what the discoveries might be.  I wonder if this is part of being rugged individualists, which sometimes seems like a national past-time.    We bring this strong sense of independence, individuality and go-it-aloneness to our search for God.   If God is looking for me, is that a good thing?  It takes away some of my control of this process.  Will I be judged, even punished, once I am found?   What will happen next?\\nThis is where I find the matching of the Luke story today with this passage from Exodus to be unexpectedly revealing.   I caution us about a literal reading of this supposed interchange between God and Moses.  We can get pretty wound up if we focus on wondering “just how did a conversation between a person and God get recorded?”  Think of this account as a parable, like the one’s Jesus taught.  It’s recounted as Jewish sacred history, its recorded so people can know what God is like.  And it’s a mind-bender!  This is a scene from the Israelites time in the wilderness, following the escape/Exodus from slavery in Egypt.  They are pretty lost themselves at this point, uncertain where the promised land is and how to get there. Their leader Moses keeps going up to the mountain to commune with God, and this time he hasn’t been back for days and days.  The man left in charge, Aaron, is trying to keep the peace among the lost, the worried and restive families.  They want something to follow, some symbol of this mysterious God that “will go before us” and lead them.  Aaron suggests they take all their gold jewelry and melt it down to form a golden calf.   “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord” Aaron proclaimed when they were done, and they brought burnt offerings and celebrated in front of what they considered to be an image of the deities that had brought them up out of Egypt.  God gets whiff of what is happening down below and confronts Moses.   Whether they were actually worshiping other gods or simply ached for a symbolic representation of their one God and Lord, the text isn’t quite clear.  It was to be a “festival to the Lord.”  What is clear is that God is furious, and goes on a rant, pretty much disowning and destroying these  people who seem to have lost their senses and their connection with God.  The people God just made a covenant of mutual relationship with God a few chapters back.  \\nSeveral commentators have noted how Moses and God argue back and forth, almost like two parents trying to pass the blame for their disobedient child.  No, she’s your child!  No, she’s your daughter!  Or, as one commentator ruefully asks: Is the Lord an insecure deity with  self-image issues?  What finally ensues is that God changes God’s mind.  God actually repents, so the story goes.  God changes God’s perspective.  Yes, it does sound terribly anthropomorphic.   But compelling to me.  If God can change Gods perspective and repent, reorient, hmmmm maybe we can too.  We are afterall, made in God’s image, according to our Creation stories.  Maybe that’s the beginning of letting myself be found.  Stop, open myself to a new perspective, repent, reorient, be ready to receive.  It’s another over-the-top story, but the Hebrew writers of Jesus’ tradition wanted people to know that God is persuadable and extremely passionate when it comes to human beings.  That’s maybe why God spends so much energy searching for us.\\n\\tThis God Jesus spoke about, this is not a waiting God but a searching God.  Not a God who waits for our purity or holiness to emerge, not a God who waits for us to find God.  This is a God who follows us out into the places of our personal loneliness and our separateness.  This is the God who searches us out in uncertain transition times as congregations and uncertain times as a nation.  Watch this week.  How is God searching you out? There may be invitations to stretch ourselves, to welcome lost parts of ourselves, to open ourselves to those who seem different from us.  Maybe even a spontaneous invite to rejoice and feast together with all kinds of unlikely characters.  Let’s keep our eyes and ears open.  Someone, infinitely mysterious and passionately close at hand, is searching for each of us.  Thanks be to God. Amen.\\t  \\n\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe context for this reading from Hebrew scriptures, what we call the Old Testament, is the Exodus story.  The Jews have escaped from slavery in Egypt and are now wandering in the wilderness trying to get to the promised land.  Their leader Moses has brought them a covenant with God, the 10 commandments, and now is back up on the mountain praying.  The people are worried, feeling abandoned and afraid.  Aaron, who has been left in charge, has helped them build a golden calf, to represent divine power in their midst which they are sorely missing.  They have just finished bringing burnt sacrifices to this golden idol and celebrating together.  Today’s reading starts with God confronting Moses with what has happened….\\nA reading from Exodus 32:7-14 (read the passage now)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Suddenly, a loud whoshing of wind comes out of no-where.  “Whoah….what was that?”  They turn to one another and are startled to see something like tongues of flame dancing on top of each of their heads.   Even more bizaare, they have each started speaking in a variety of foreign tongues they have never learned.  What?  Is this what Jesus was talking about – the Spirit will pour out upon you? \\n          The disciples hiding in Jerusalem were facing a whole new world where their old ways of approaching life just were not going to work.  They had thrown their lot in with this teacher and healer Jesus.  But what to do now that Jesus seems to be really gone? Well, maybe we’ll just go back to fishing in Galilee, they say to each other.  It’s understandable to want to reach for a familiar solution when faced with a difficult problem.  And sometimes this works.  In the church this might look like, the roof is leaking, send someone up there who knows how to fix the roof!  Need a new Office Manager?  Advertize, interview, hire!  In the business world, this is called fixing a familiar, technical problem with current know-how.  But, some problems take a different approach, where we have to think outside of the box.  The solution itself requires openness, curiosity, intuition, vulnerability, new learning.  How does a church figure out how to heal from major conflict?  How do we become more welcoming of young families, single people, the LGBTQ community?  How do we discern what God is calling this church to do regarding climate change, gun violence, poverty, racism, reproductive rights, immigration reform, and other social justice issues of the day?  These are what are called “adaptive challenges” in the business world, and churches would do well to pay heed.  Adaptive challenges may be clear but their solutions are not: they are not resolved in the ways problems used to be fixed.  Conflict? Oh, well, we just need a new pastor and everything will be fine.  And we avoid the adaptive challenge of changing our expectations about how we will communicate and behave with one another.  We have to push beyond, “how can we get people to not disagree” to “how do we really dive into this conflict, honestly, tender-hearted and respectfully, and see where this conversation and the Holy Spirit may take us?”  \\n\\tI’ve been helped in understanding this idea of adaptive challenges in reading a book about canoeing.  It has a strange title: Canoeing the Mountains: Christian Leadership in Uncharted Territory. written by a Presbyterian pastor and seminary professor, Rev.Tod Boisinger.  “Canoeing the Mountains?” I said to my seminary classmate who recommended it.  Canoes belong in lakes and rivers, not charging up a mountain!\\n\\tWhich, according to this book, is just what Merriweather Lewis and William Clark discovered in the early 1800’s when they set out to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase.  These guys were canoeists, and they were prepared to paddle an inland waterway that would lead them to the Pacific Ocean!  The expedition proceeded accordingly, for a while, and then they ran into the Rocky Mountains.  Lewis and Clark realized that their whole expedition was built on a false expectation.  Not only did they have to abandon their trusted canoes, they had to face the adaptive challenge of crossing, surviving in, unknown terrain populated by unfamiliar people.  They ended up having to trust an “outsider” to guide them and to basically save their necks.  A young Shosone woman named Sacagawea.  She became their translator as they encountered the native residents of that land.  She was an indispensible guide to the natural environment for their scientific studies, helping them scout over new terrain until they finally reached the Pacific.  \\n\\tOkay, church, says Rev. Bolsinger: “paddling your canoes,” the way you once did church together, is not going to get you where you need to go.  Going sideways with our complaints may seem familiar and polite but it doesn’t serve the church as a whole.  We may have to leave the canoes of old assumptions and ways of doing things, and find new navigational and leadership tools into this uncharted territory.  Church structure, church governance, may have to look different in order to navigate this new terrain ahead.  We no longer live in a mono-culture where everyone seems to be Christian, looks like us and readily attends church.  Ours is a multi-faith, multi-ethnic nation, increasingly filled with people different from us.  And, contrary to what some of the media tells us, that is not necessarily a dangerous or scarey thing.  Here’s the part I found really compelling in Rev. Bolsinger’s book: Like Lewis and Clark turning to Sacagewea, we may have to learn to trust those who seem to be “outsiders.”.  It may be someone who is different from you or who hasn’t been around here as long as you.  I wonder if this is why the three women were placed in the center of the Coptic painting; typically the outlyers in a patriarchal culture, Jesus had welcomed women into his inner circle and so did the early church.  Sometimes it is the newcomer, or the marginalized person, who has the clearest insight into adaptive challenges facing the church.\\n\\tThe crowd that listened to the disciples speak in their own individual languages about God’s wondrous works, weren’t sure what to make of this bizarre commotion.  Are these people drunk?  And these disciples are outsiders, Galileans, or put more bluntly, country bumpkins.  But when Peter finally starts to speak, he goes to the heart of the adaptive challenges facing the Jewish community at that time:  They were living under oppressive Roman rule, where the established Jewish purity laws were further dividing the Jewish community between rich and poor, powerful and marginzalized.  Into this moment when the gap between present realities and the reign of God’s mercy and justice and peace are glaringly obvious, said Peter, God is sending the power of the Holy Spirit.  And Peter uses the words from the Jewish prophet Joel, written hundreds of years before, during another time of confusion and dislocation during the Jews’ forced exile in Babylonia.  Joel pointed to a time to come, when God would “pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, even your slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit and they shall prophesy.”  This is now, says Peter, this time of prophesy, visions and dreams coming from the “outsiders,” the ones you least expect, is upon us! Who expects this visioning and guidance to come from kids or our oldest people or slaves or the women disciples…..or a pregnant Shoshone Indian woman?  \\nI wonder who might be those perceived as “outsiders” who will help direct us into the new world of ministry and service ahead?  The ancient Coptic painting shows the disciples, and some typical outsiders, the women, even Judas, all hanging out together.  This may be an important clue about how we are to move forward as a church.  Hang in there, be open, be expectant.  May the Spirit of truth lead us together.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tAs I have thought Jesus’ teachings on forgiveness this week, I have found myself wondering:  how is it that people are able to love their enemies through events like those of the civil rights era?  How do we speak of such love, and of the practice of forgiveness, in a nation where racial disparity and divides are still such a deep part of our experience as a nation?   The legacy of slavery is deep in our history.  I know that my New England ancestors, while not slave owners themselves, surely benefited financially from an early economic system bolstered by the profits of the slave trade.  What is the interplay between national repentance and forgiveness for sins and the inner workings of repentance and forgiveness in our own, individual hearts?  Do national hearts “harden” sometimes, just as individual’s do?\\n\\tThese are perplexing and disturbing questions for me this morning, for which I don’t have ready answers.  But as we move on the “Lenten Journey of the Heart” this Lenten Season at Falcon Heights Church, our text brings us the teachings of Jesus about loving enemies and forgiveness.   Henry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest, theologian and author once wrote:  \"Forgiveness is the name of love practiced among people who love poorly. \\xa0The hard truth is that all people love poorly. \\xa0We need\\xa0to forgive and be forgiven every day, every hour increasingly. \\xa0That is the great work of love among the fellowship of the weak that\\xa0is the human family.\"  (Henri J. M. Nouwen, The Only Necessary Thing: Living A Prayerful Life, p. 153)\\n\\tPerhaps this is a place to start:  acknowledging that we are all part of this “fellowship of the weak that is the human family.”   Jesus was quite perceptive on this point, and he challenged people beyond custom and niceties by offering spiritual practices that would help us in our weakness.  In today’s verses from Luke, Jesus has just come down off a nearby mountain, after a time of prayer and conversation with his closest followers.  He’s surrounded now with the larger crowd of disciples, men and women who are following him from town to town, and people who have come from Judea, Jerusalem, as well as the coastal cities, to hear him.  Word has gotten out and people press forward.   “All the crowd sought to touch him, for power came forth from him and healed them all,”  writes Luke. \\n\\tIn the middle of all this commotion, Jesus “lifted up his eyes on his disciples” and starts in teaching again.  He launches into his call to loving our enemies.  This is the context in which he speaks of forgiveness.  And here, the challenge of Christian loving punches through any idealized notion of polite niceties and sweet harmony. Love your enemies. This is the love that enables people, with fierce passivity, to face bully clubs, snarling dogs and tear gas. \\n\\n\\tI imagine that this call to “love your enemies” hit those listening to Jesus, that first century day, like a verbal grenade.  It’s not that this idea was entirely new to Judaism, as any good Jew knew that God’s mercy fell on the just and the unjust among them.  Yes, everyone knew that Hebrew scripture taught that we are all to love our neighbor as ourselves.  The Golden Rule business of reciprocity:  we should respond in kind, everything comes around.  But here Jesus’ listeners were given an extra-ordinary challenge in this business of loving:  love the person who does not carry your best interest at heart.  The one who has hurt you, betrayed you, damaged you.  How do we get over it when we are offended, or annoyed or even hurt by another’s behavior?  How do we forgive?  We can’t seem to forget, but how do these memories soften and change for us?  Is it prudent, even, to let this happen? \\n\\n\\t During my years of ministry in northern California, I met a man named Frederick Luskin who was conducting a research study on forgiveness at Stanford University.  The interfaith pastoral counseling center I directed at that time invited him to speak at a public forum on forgiveness that we were sponsoring.  Luskin, along with a variety of other mental health professionals, had decided to explore this concept and practice of forgiveness which for centuries been the realm of religion.  He wanted to quantify, through interviews and medical exams, whether forgiving someone could improve your emotional or physical health.  It’s probably no surprise that he discovered that holding onto grudges, resentments and hurts actually stressed people out so much that it disrupted their lives in many measureable ways.  He spoke of his work in Ireland, with Protestant and Catholic mother’s of those killed in sectarian violence, who were able to come together and hear one another’s stories, who were somehow able to forgive what seemed unforgiveable.  \\n\\n\\tI  was struck by Luskin’s  image of what unforgiveness or unresolved grievances, does to us:  Picture the crowded screen in front of a harried air traffic controller.  Picture the chaos in the room and the jumble of planes on the screen.  Now imagine that your unresolved grievances are the planes on that screen that have been circling for days and weeks on end.  Most of the other planes have landed, but your unresolved grievances continue to take up precious air space, draining resources that may be needed in an emergency.  Having them on the screen forces you to work harder and increases the chance for accidents.  The grievance planes become a source of stress and burnout is often the result.  (Frederick Luskin, Forgive for Good, “Introduction,” p. vii).\\n\\n\\tI think of how Jesus, in the Lord’s Prayer, instructed his followers to ask for daily bread, to ask for forgiveness, and to ask for help in resisting temptation.   I have heard it said that we can think of daily bread as relating to our present concerns, forgiveness to our past, and help in temptation to our future.  Jesus understood that people had issues with their past, present and future.  I find this distinction helpful, especially when it comes to understanding the action of forgiveness in our lives.  Forgiveness has to do with how we live with the past, how the past dwells in our memory and heart.   How we are living with all those grievance planes flying around our screens?  How’s that working for us?\\n\\n\\tSomething else seems to happen when we are unforgiving.  It seems to cloud our ability to perceive current reality.  I bumped into these words by Hugh Prather the other day about forgiveness.  A pastoral counselor and author of many popular self-help books and spiritual reflections, Prather wrote in his Morning Notes: 365 Meditations to Wake You Up:  “A judgmental feeling about another person is based on the same belief as my fear of making mistakes: I think what someone once did is more important than how the person is now.”  We tend to do this to ourselves, and to others.  The past imprisons us and them.  Prather suggests that our challenge is to try encountering people as they are today.  Ask God to help you practice meeting people you feel unforgiving towards as if it is the first time you are meeting.  As we do this, we will notice immediately whether or not the person’s past actions are still lodged in our awareness, because it is going to make perceiving them as they are now really difficult!   Prather says we will slowly notice more receptivity, and even possibility, inklings of forgiveness, when we start each counter with a “clean slate.”   \\n\\n\\tForgiveness does not necessarily rebuild trust or relationships.  But for starters, it may help us be less boring!  Forgiving helps us let go of that old grievance story we just love to tell….and retell.   Yes, it is only the first step, the step we have the opportunity to take, in healing ourselves. On-going rebuilding trust and relationships is the work of heartfelt apologies which do not grovel but name the offense clearly.  We certainly don’t do all this under our own steam.  I know I have been able to forgive only by praying for God’s sustaining power and hopefulness. \\n\\n\\tFinally, I wonder what forgiveness this might look like for us as a nation, to name the offense of slavery, and the years of racial injustice and inequality that have unfolded since then, clearly?  What does it look like in congregations where there has been conflict, where those who have offended begin to the offenses clearly?  We all “love poorly” at times, God help us.  Loving our enemies seems impossible.  But the spiritual practice of forgiveness helps us clear our side of the street and de-clutter the “precious air space,” of our minds.  It allows for hardened hearts to soften.  May forgiving hearts continue to grow within each of us.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'A few thoughts about the practice of joy.\\n\\nIN THE RED: I am not proud to admit this, but I have been “in the red” for quite awhile.  I’m not talking financially; my email has been “in the red.”  This is when the little bar showing you how full your email box turns RED.  It means you are almost at 100% capacity with old emails (received and sent) and there is no more room for anything new to happen in your account!  For months I have been slowly deleting, I would bring it down to YELLOW, but couldn’t figure out how to delete in large chunks.  Earlier this week I asked my husband Chris about marking and deleting 25 at a time and he showed me how to do it.  Drafts, received, sent, disappearing to my trash file and out into who knows where.  And within about 15 minutes of this, I was out of the RED zone and now back in the safe BLUE zone.  I ran downstairs to the kitchen and explaimed: “I’m in the BLUE zone!”  And I in that moment I realized I was feeling great joy.  That’s interesting, I thought, I did something that made me feel joy!  What just happened?  I went back upstairs and goggled my sermon title: “the practice of joy” and lo and behold there was an article listing 40 ways to practice joy, bring more joy into your life.  Here’s two of them: “be vulnerable; admit don’t know and “learn just one little piece of new technology.” \\n\\nMARY AND SAYING “YES”: What else brings joy into our lives?  I have been thinking about Mary, Jesus’ mother.  She receives this astounding news that she will have a baby who will “be great and the Son of the Most High.” I wonder how she went from feeling confused and scared by the angels announcement, to her expression of deep joy as she travels to visit her cousin Elizabeth who is pregnant with John the Baptist.  \\nWE CAN PRACTICE “YES”:Perhaps there is something about saying “yes” that leads to joy.  We each might experiment with saying “yes” this week.  Not so much “yes I’ll do that extra task” but an inside “yes” to whatever is happening around us in the moment.  Not to say it is right or should always be that way.  But simply show up for what we are experiencing and feeling and acknowledging “yes.”  We don’t just wait for something to happen to us to make us happy.  We show up and say “yes” and bring our full attention to this present moment, whatever it is.  This may be another clue as to how we can practice joy.\\nMARY FINDS JOY: I wonder if that is what happened to Mary as she said “yes” to the angel.  “Yes” to something she could not fully understand, and to a future she could not predict.  And soon she travels to see Elizabeth who says the baby inside her is leaping for joy.  Mary said “yes” and she too is filled with joy: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.”  (Sing….)\\n\\tREPEAT THE SOUNDING JOY,\\n\\tREPEAT THE SOUNDING JOY,\\n\\tRE-PEAT, RE-PEAT THE SOUNDING JOY!\\n',\n",
       " '\\t The American author, EB White, is best known for his children’s books, Stuart Little and Charlotte’s Web.  I keep a saying of White’s tacked up over my desk.  It seems to sum up the everyday dilemna about how to we each use the gift of time.  The saying goes like this:\\nI arise in the morning torn between a desire to save the world, and a desire to savor the world.  This makes it hard to plan the day.\\nA week ago Saturday, we held a community-wide Service of Prayer and Lament, following the deaths of two more African American men during encounters with police, and the deaths of five police officers following a peaceful protest rally in Dallas.  Our mayor, Peter Lynstrom helped me lead that service of worship, and we have plans for our congregation to join the City of Falcon Heights in exploring a deeper understanding regarding racial inequities, needed changes and the possibilities for community healing .  \\n\\tWhat is the balance, in any of our lives between saving and savoring the world?  Am I going to reach out in some kind of service and do my part in saving this broken and hurting world?  Am I going to I will reach inward with a quieter, more inward considering of God’s presence and guidance, through study and prayer, quietly savoring this complex world and this gift called life?  Everyday, we each are faced with these choices.  Beyond the necessities of working for a living and getting the dishes done, what else might God have us be doing? \\n\\tIn today’s scripture reading, we hear a story of two sisters inviting Jesus into their home.  Martha welcomes Jesus then focuses on preparing the meal.  Mary quietly sits at Jesus’ feet, in the recognized posture of a disciples, and listens to his teachings. Suddenly, something snaps for Martha and she lashes out at Jesus.  “don’t you care that I’m doing all the work while she works?  Make her get in here and help!”  And she gets chastized for her efforts.\\t\\nWhy did the Gospel writer Luke included this story in his telling of Jesus’ teachings and ministry?  I think Luke offers this short vignette as an example of true discipleship, as guidance for his community of Christians on what is most important in the life of Christian faith.  In the telling, Luke lifts up two priorities for anyone who would seek to follow Jesus.   There is the active-seeming priority of doing service to others, as exemplified by Martha’s serving; there is the more passive-seeming priority of reflecting on Jesus teachings, as observed in Mary’s quiet listening at Jesus feet.   It’s a deceptively simple story, that can easily serve as a put down of traditional women’s roles and of the person who always ends up in the kitchen.   Let’s look closer and see what was going on.\\n\\tWhere do you see yourself in the story?  Eager to welcome an esteemed guest in your home and to extend warm hospitality, like Martha?  Hungry to listen quietly and soak in Jesus’ words like Mary? Or do you feel frustrated like Jesus, as you watch someone you love become anxious and distracted by serving situation at hand?  I really feel for Martha in this story, perhaps because so many times I have found myself in her place.  Eager to make a big to-do in my hospitality efforts, or even details behind the scene of an important church event, I have sometimes lost track of the real focus and have become resentful of those who just sat and chatted.  Martha and Mary have an honored dinner guest in their midst, and they clearly are not going to order carry-out.  The meal has to get to the table, not just because people are hungry but because hospitality to the wayfarer, the visitor, was so deeply embedded in their culture.  What seems to be the problem?\\n\\tAs Luke tells it, Martha has become busy with “many tasks.” The word “task” in Greek is “diakonein, ” which is used elsewhere in the New Testament to describe Christian ministry or the role of deacon.   Discipleship is about service to others.  But here, the serving has become a problem and it has distracted Martha.  She gets exasperated, and we soon realize how off-centered she must feel.  \\n\\tEven more problematic, she doesn’t seem to take responsibility for her own frazzeledness; she immediately moves to blame.  She doesn’t confront her sister Mary directly, “Mary, I could use alittle help here, please!”  She has taken on too much, she appears to be feeling resentful of her sister and then she “triangles” someone else into the conflict.   We’re familiar with triangling as it often happens in conflicts within families, the work place and in congregation, when we don’t go directly to the person we have the disagreement with. Martha tries to “triangle” Jesus: “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself?”  I can hear a winey insistence in her voice.  “Tell her to help me,” Martha demands.   She doesn’t approach Mary, and suggest they both work to quickly get dinner on the table then they can all sit and listen to Jesus.    Perhaps Martha wanted the table set just so, and the dishes prepared as only she could do it.  Whatever, her expectations and her anxiousness collide with the reality that only a simple meal is needed.  “Martha, Martha,” says Jesus.  I can hear both the exasperation and the compassion in his voice.  “You are worried and distracted by many things…few things are necessary, there is need of only one thing.”  Jesus alludes here not just to a simple meal but a simple focus.  “Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”\\n\\tSo what is this “better part?”  Hearing the word of God’s messenger is even more important than the ancient practice of hospitality.  So often, I hear the question during difficult times like this:  What can we do to improve relations with different communities?  What I am learning is that as a white person, my first response needs to not be about doing, doing for, doing to fix.  First of all, this thinking about doing can make us feel anxious and distracted, and often helpless and powerless.  And nothing happens.  And as important as our charity work of food and clothing collection, sending money, are, they can sometimes be a distancing between me and those in need; it can also be a distraction.  The first task for me as a white Christian is about listening and learning.  I need to be listening to the black community more deeply, so I can better hear the frustration, the alienation, the fear, the anger they experience.  I need to be learning more fully about my unique experience as a white person, of the safety and priviledge that my skin color brings me each day.  I believe this is what Jesus would have me be learning right now.  There is an important way I need to be “sitting at Jesus feet,” like Mary, being directed in my listening, reading, reflecting.  Carving time out for silence and prayer, moving back into the news and reflective critique on what is happening across our nation, and then back into scripture reading, quiet and prayer.  Not for information necessarily but for my formation as a follower of Jesus.  We let Jesus’ words soak into us, to form us, so we can draw deeply of the well spring of God’s sustaining presence in these challenging days. \\n\\tBoth saving the world and a reflective savoring of the world are important. But “few things are necessary” Jesus reminds us today. I wonder how Mary and Martha reached across the divide between themselves, after Jesus left that night.  I hope they talked a bit, did some dishes together, heard each other in new ways.  How do we reach across our yawning conflicting divide as a nation?  How might we deepen our understanding of what it means to live as a black person in our community?  How might we soul-search together about the priviledge of whiteness?  How might we stay focused on the world that God intends and to which God calls us to help create?  Let’s keep talking and exploring together.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOnce upon a time, there was a man who looked upon Christmas as a lot of humbug.  He wasn’t mean like the Grinch of Dr. Seuss, and he wasn’t  a lonely and miserly man like Charles Dicken’s Scrooge.  In fact, he really was a very kind and decent person.  He was generous to his family, honest in his business dealings and lovingly attentive to his elderly parents.\\n\\tBut the man just did not know what to do with the ideas, the beliefs about Christmas.   Although raised in the church as a child, he seldom attended church with his own family as an adult.  It was something about all the idea of the Incarnation, of God becoming human in Jesus that he would hear preached each December.  It just did not make sense to him and he didn’t want to pretend.  “I’m sorry to distress you, my dear,” he told his wife.   She would patiently reply, “oh my love, that’s alright.  You can come with your doubts.  I don’t understand it all either, it is such a Mystery this incredible connection between God and humans.  But the stories in the Bible seem true in such a deep, poetic sense.  I believe I see the heart of God when I hear about Jesus.”  Well, this sounded a bit muddled to the man, not quite logicial.  “Hmmmmm,” he replied.\\n\\tOn Christmas Eve one year, the man’s wife and children went into town to church for the late night service.  He declined their invitation to go with them.  “I’d feel like a hypocrite,” he explained.  I’ll stay at home and keep the fireplace stoked; I’ll wait up for you.”  “OK, Daddy, see you later,” said his children.\\n\\tShortly after his family drove away in the car, snow began to fall.  He went to the window and watched the flurries getting heavier and heavier.  “If we must celebrate Christmas,” he reflected, “it’s nice to have a snow-covered, white one.”  He watched the snowflakes glisten and catch on the bare tree branches, then went back to his chair by the fireside.  He read his newspaper and shook his head in dismay at all the ads for Christmas gifts; all the commercialism of the season troubled him too.  He wondered what this person Jesus would think about all that.\\n\\tThe room was quiet, except for an occasional snap of the burning logs in the fireplace and the russle of his newspaper.  Suddenly, he was startled by a dull, thudding sound. THONK!  It was quickly followed by a second thud, then a third.  THONK, THONK!  It was coming from the large picture window across the room, the one that faced out to the street.  At first he thought someone must be throwing snowballs at his window.  “Now, who in the world….” He muttered, heaving himself out of his deep chair.\\n\\tWhen he looked out the front door to investigate, the man found a flock of birds huddled together in the snow.  They were small birds and they looked pretty miserable.  They had been caught in the sudden snow storm.  In a desperate search for shelter that had apparently tried to fly through the warm light of his window!  What a pitiful sight they were!  \\n\\t“I can’t let these poor poor creatures lie there in the snow and freeze,” he thought, “but how can I possibly help them?”  Then he remembered the barn on their property, the one where his children’s pony was stabled and where the family kept a few chickens.  The barn would provide a warm shelter, with dry hay and away from the snow and wind!  He quickly put on his coat and snowboots and gloves, and tramped out through the deepening snow to the barn.  He opened the doors wide and turned on the the light.  He waited….but the birds didn’t come in the barn.  In fact, they didn’t even seem to notice as they huddled together.\\n\\t“Food will bring them in,” he thought.  So he hurried back to the house for bread, and crumbled it and sprinkled in on the snow, making a trail into the barn.  But to his dismay, the birds ignored the breadcrumbs and just continued to huddle and flop around helplessly in the snow.  \\n\\t“Good grief,” thought the man.  He then tried to shoo them into the barn by walking around and waving his arms.  But the birds, pretty confused by now, just scattered in every direction except into the warm, lighted barn.  “Rats!” exclaimed the man, “they must think I am a strange and terrifying creature!”  “I’m trying to help them and they are just scared of me!”\\n\\t“If only I could be a bird myself, just for a few minutes,” he muttered to himself.  “Perhaps I could lead them out of the cold and darkness, towards the light.”  Just then, church bells began to ring in the distance.  “It must be midnight,” he thought.  He just stood there, listening to the bells pealing out the joyful tidings of Christmas.  “If only I could become a bird, myself,” he mused, “I could talk to them and they would trust me and would lead them safely out of the cold and darkness…and into life.”  He looked at the birds and then at the barn door.  “I wonder, hmmmm,…”  And he found himself sinking down in the snow and actually kneeling, out there with the white snowflakes swirling around him….his heart slowly opening to something, to a Presence he couldn’t quite understand.     \\n\\tAnd from the back of his memory, from deep in his childhood, came the words of the carol, and he softly began to sing:  “O come let us adore him, oh come let us adore him, of come let us adore him, Christ the Lord.”   \\n',\n",
       " '\\t When I first moved up here, I was surprised to hear people say how much they disliked November.  No leaves, bare ground, cold, bleak, should season, nothing happening, they would moan. But I brought with me an odd appreciation for these in-between weeks right before Thanksgiving.  Glorious autumn is certainly over, but I’m not behind yet on holiday dinner preparations, Advent planning, my Christmas cards, gift buying.   Darkening mid-November has always felt to me like a reflective pause, leaving me quietly alert to changes and stripping down in the world around me.  \\nAs I wrote in our November newsletter, the bareness of trees, turbulence of the lake, chill wind, brings an air of expectancy.   God is astir among us, I sense.  Something, something is next.  Something is next in this church, I believe.  And, it looks like something is next for our nation.  There is an expectancy of something going to happen, which is for some deeply troubling, for others hopeful – it’s got us stirred up!  Wherever we each sit on the political divide, it is pretty unsettling to watch our country go through impeachment proceedings.  Whether we are paying rapt attention to the testimonies or are only vaguely aware that Congress feels compelled to investigate possible wrong-doings by a sitting President, it puts us on edge and leaves us wondering.  What could God doing in the midst of all this?  The Hebrew prophet Isaiah talked of a “new heavens and new earth” emerging, after a time of conflict and devastation of the people of Israel.  How might this force of restoration and renewal be working among us….in our nation, in our congregation?  I resonate with these words of Walter Bruggemann, the Hebrew scripture scholar:  “During November we reach the conclusion of the church year. We remember our dead and ponder the God of life. We begin Advent and the season of alert waiting for the newness that God will give.” \\nThere is a curious sycronicity with this moment in time and the two readings assigned for this Sunday.  In using the Revised Common Lectionary shared by Protestant and Catholic congregations all over the world, we step into a flow of scripture passages chosen years ago and offered to us as an orderly way to move through a wide variety of Biblical themes through the church year.  Isaiah brings a hopeful word to the people returning to their ruined Jerusalem, following captivity in Babylon; words of hope for restoration and new life that God is making possible.  This phrase caught my attention: “For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth,” proclaims God, “the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.”  How does that work, I wonder, when we are trying to remember and name times of challenge and struggle in our congregation and learn from them?  When our law makers are trying to get to the root of some recent “former” things and actions by those entrusted with power and authority?   How do we move into the new…..remember or don’t remember?   Hold that question in your mind for a moment. \\nThe Luke passage has a strangely somber and anticipatory mood, as Jesus confronts his disciples inamoured perspective with the huge stone and adorned with gold rebuilt Jersualem Temple.  Huge crowds have come to the city for the spring Feast of Passover; Jesus and his followers also are here for these seasonal celebrations in the religious hub of the nation.  They stand just outside the enormous Jerusalem temple Initially built in the 10th century BEC the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians.  In Bu Jesus’ time, it had been rebuilt over the centuries and now finally renovated to its previous architectural glory by King Herod the Great.  Constructed to accommodate up to 400,000 worshippers inside and out, huge limestone walls, parts of it covered in gold.  If a Biblical literalist wants to use signs of disaster to justify God’s punishment of certain people, they often turn to this passage, seeing it as a prediction of the end times.  But I don’t think that was Jesus’ purpose in noticing the impermanence of human building construction.  \\n\\tUsing imagery of apocalyptic, end-times disasters, Jesus punches through the disciples’ fawning words by cautioning them to notice where their gaze was fixed; what were they paying attention to?  He speaks of coming destruction and suffering.  It’s as if he was saying: You are focusing on the wrong thing!  All you see in this glorious human building will eventually crumble.  You will be like strangers in a strange land and you will be persecuted suffer because of me….and….. God will be moving in all of this!  Not that God causes, or punishes people with all these disasters.  But know that God will be moving in and through all of this.   Here is this dire and grim proclamation from Jesus during a week of impeachment proceedings that has stirred some of us up big time, and has taken on almost apolcalyptic proportions.   Here in the weeks following History Sunday, when we are looking through at some difficult and painful situations in our past.  But we can get stuck there.  I have started to wonder where my own attention and gaze, my attentive energy is going.  Am I actually looking for God at work, restoring and renewing?  Where do you find your attention fixed in these days? \\nThere was an emerging thread in Jewish beliefs in Jesus’ time that certain disasters would preceed the end of history as it is was known, and would initiate God’s full reign of justice and mercy on earth.  Jesus had already alluded to the end times in his teachings, calling himself “the Son of Man,” meaning “the Son of the human one,” a popular term from Hebrew apocalyptic scriptures for one who will appear as God’s emissary.  As Jesus and his followers stand outside the large colonnades and graceful porticoes, the disciples don’t seem to comprehend the looming disaster of Jesus’ confrontation with religious and political authorities, his imminent arrest and imprisonment. Their attention is elsewhere.  “Jesus, aren’t these temple walls and stones amazing!” the disciples gush.  “Incredible what people can do it they put their mind and backs to it!  Wow, awesome,” we can hear them mutter among themselves. \\nEasy to get enthralled, just like the disciples.  But be it the Jersusalem Temple, the World Trade Towers, our own homes or businesses, political movements, our church facility or a congregation we once knew….it can all tumble down, or good or for evil.  And it is also natural to become enthralled and overwhelmed by our own human disasters.  Impeachment hearings.  Grievances about what has happened to us in a congregation.  Where is our attention, our gaze, Jesus asks us.\\nThe Temple will be destroyed again in 70 CE, as the Romans squash a local Jewish uprising that dared challenge their repressive regime.  But Rome too eventually falls; it’s reasoned rule of law and massive military power crumbling.  In the midst of turmoil that seems to be with us in every age, Jesus reminds his followers that God is working in history.  Something incredible, God’s hidden workings, are about to be manifest; they are going to be born among you, says Jesus.  Do not despair over these difficult times, he admonishes.  Hold fast, be alert and watchful.  See how these times provide an “opportunity to testify,” suggests Jesus.  \\n\\tI believe we are asked to testify to God’s movement for peace and justice in this world, in the midst of what feels like to many of us to be an overwhelming mess.  To notice, following God’s compassionate gaze, who is out on the edge, who is vulnerable in this new day, who is marginalized.  And so we again hold a Transgender Service of Remembrance this Wednesday, on the day when people around the world testify to those who have been murdured because they were transgender.  What else needs to be done first, then done next and next, as we name and address the divisions and inequities in our community, in our world?   We pay attention to who is most at risk.  We continue discussion about how we might reach out to the LGBTQ community, to our immigrants and refugees.  We put huge energy into providing a Community Thanksgiving Dinner again so no one in town has to eat alone.  \\n\\tHere’s the thing in times like this:  Something happens within us as we gather together, claiming that the God’s Spirit of forgiveness, renewal and wholeness is working in our midst.  We refocus; we pay attention in new ways.  We learn to testify to the movement of the Spirit in our own lives, in the midst of good times and trying times and tragedies. We find ourselves spreading the word that life is more than meets the eye.  All the while watching, waiting, welcoming the new world God is creating.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\tI have been re-visiting a book called “Listening to God: Spiritual Formation in Congregations,” by John Ackerman.  He describes what he sees as a distinct change in Christian spirituality in the last 50 years.   I think that exploring this shift in emphasis may give us a clue about these divine encounters described in today’s scripture readings.\\n\\tAckerman writes:  “There has been a sea change in the past 50 years in the nature and character of Christian spirituality.  In the 1950’s, spirituality was centered in churches.  That was where one found God.  Churches were organized with top-down authority.  Scholars had more authority than laypeople, and the ordinary person in the pew found comfort in an institution.  The tectonic shift has moved us from spirituality found in a place of dwelling to spirituality experienced in a group of seekers.”   He goes on to describe how “habitation spirituality focuses on the God who has a sacred space in heaven and on earth in which humans can dwell.  Before the 1960’s this belief was the predominate expression of spirituality in America.  A ‘seeking spirituality,’ which arose in the 1960’s, (and the decades following) is characterized by knowing God on the journey rather than in houses of worship alone.…A seeking spirituality is focused not on a place so much as on the activity of search for meaning, journeying through life.  The new pattern accepts a great deal of diversity and choice.  At its worst, it is a shopping-mall mentality; at best, searching acknowledges that one style of spirituality does not fit at all.” \\n\\tIf I am understanding Ackerman correctly, one way of relating to God is knowing God in a place and another way to relating to is connected to knowing God on a journey, on the move.  He notes that “both patterns are ancient,” habitation/dwelling spirituality and journey/seeking spirituality “can be found in the Bible.  Traditionally, dwelling spirituality constructs the Temple in Jerusalem and finds God in the Holy of Holies; seeking spirituality is found in the (journey through the) desert, in the words of the prophets.”   A sense of belonging to tribe and congregation, our place of worship being a safe haven where we can find answers to life’s perplexing questions, God as “a mighty fortress,” “ the rock of ages,” the refuge to which we can flee: all of these are Biblical images which, rightfully so, both define and sustain us.  What Ackerman is suggesting is that this image of church (ALONE) is not going to sustain and challenge the enormous complexity, rapid changes and diversity of the 21st century world.\\n\\tConsider the Exodus story and the Israelites struggle’ to face the unknown as they traveled through the wilderness:  So often they longed for their previous lives, for their home in Egypt.   Invited to come up to this lonely mountain with Jesus for prayer, the disciples may have been in much the same emotional space.   “Jesus, this is truly amazing!  You, Moses, Elijah.  It’s so good to be here; can’t we have a building campaign and just stay here with you?”\\n\\tPerhaps the disciples are getting a hint of what is coming next for Jesus at this point.  It is midpoint in his ministry and Jesus has begun to talk with them about the fact that he is going to go to Jerusalem.  Going to the huge capital city even though it is dangerous for him.  Even though he will suffer at the hands of the religious and political authorities and he will die.   Like Israelites wandering in the wilderness, the disciples don’t really know when or where they will be led.   Only days before, Jesus has been  warning them of his own death and their own eventual suffering in following him.   And when they get to this mountaintop scene, in all its glory, it will not be surprising that the disciples press for a new habitation, a place to memorialize.  They will yearn for a “dwelling spirituality,” as Ackerman would describe it.  Better to stay and commemorate a glorious past with shelters, booths to commemorate, to institutionalize, what they have seen:  Jesus astounding transfiguration along with the appearance of the Hebrew leader Moses and the prophet Elijah.   Jesus glowing radiant and bright, Moses there representing God’s law to the Jews and Elijah the Jewish prophetic tradition; all are right there with him, symbolizing the whole known Hebrew scripture in Jesus’ time.    “Rabbi,” cries Peter: “it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!”  \\n\\tBut a cloud overcomes them and they hear a voice: “This is my beloved son” – same words as after Jesus is baptized, but with an addition – “This is my Beloved, listen to him!”  And “suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.”  And immediately they are on the move again, following this one back into the teeming crowds, the healings and preaching, the impending confrontations with the authorities.\\n\\tJesus would not let them stay there.  God’s instructions?  Keep an ear open to “my beloved Son.”    “Listen” to him.  This may be the most invitation the church offers to the world.   Come, we don’t give you all the answers, but we will journey with you as together we listen to Jesus.  Join us as we will search the scriptures, pay attention to the needs of the world, and prayerfully discern God’s leading together.  The challenge for any congregation is that our dwelling, our place, our rootedness in traditions together often become our primary focus.  The tension between church being a safe haven and church being a disciple-ship school will always be there.   Today’s texts invite us down from tendency to “build booths,” to only memorize a beloved past.  As John Ackerman observes, “spiritual formation happens when individuals and congregations together can listen to God, obey God, and be transformed by God.”  \\n\\tAnd so we keep listening together as we enter this season of Lent, spiraling back around to this reflective period in the church year in yet a different place as a congregation.  How blessed we are to be together in a church that is not just “building booths” to memorialize the mountain-top past but is moving bravely into God’s future together.   Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tRED STOLES!!  With flames on them!  The children have passed these out to remind us to pay attention to the Holy Spirit moving in our lives.  \\n\\tWhen do you notice the wind?  It comes and goes, doesn’t it?  We can’t see it, but we know it is there.   Gentle breath on wind on a hot summer day, cool against our skin.   Steady breeze that fills the sails of your sailboat, perhaps sending you skimming across the Chesapeake Bay.  Loud rush and roar in the middle of the night, waking you up, tree branches tossing – will one break and fall on our house?  Wind: welcome and destructive.   Wind:  it rearranges and changes things.\\n\\tFire is the same way, but we can actually see it with our own eyes.  Welcome is it cooks our BBQ or keeps us warm on a chilly night; destructive if it spreads beyond the firepit, consumes buildings and explodes trees.  Fire rearranges things alright – changes the structure of the molecules!  \\n\\tWind and fire:  they both show up in the story we just heard.  A rush of wind through the room where Jesus’ friends were staying in Jerusalem.  It is a special spring festival day for the Jews, called Pentecost and people from all over are in the city.  The disciples are there too, but hiding.  They are afraid that the Roman soldiers might come and kill them, like they killed Jesus.  Everything logical tells them that living a new life of simplicity and service that Jesus taught is unrealistic, impractical; it’s not logical and it is dangerous.  Their brains are telling them “this is the end of the road.”  Suddenly a mighty rush of wind busts in the room then tongues of flame on top of their heads….. Bewildering!  But the next thing you know, these scared and reluctant followers of Jesus are out on the streets and are talking about God’s love, and a call to simplicity and service in Jesus’ name, in all these different languages.  All these foreign visitors in the big city of Jerusalem started to hear and understand them.   Different languages were not dividing people.  Wow…what happened to these disciples?\\n\\tI think that what happened in that room is that something inside of the disciples got blown around, fire-ed up, molecules scrambled and cracked open.  Their brains couldn’t think their way out of being stuck.  They had to be rearranged inside.  God’s power, the Holy Spirit, changed them.  \\n\\tMost of us have brains that work pretty darn well on their own in this world.  Ooooo it’s 10:10 on Sunday morning; time to drive to church!  We need more milk; run to the grocery store.  Wow, this is a hard math problem, this income tax form is complicated, come on brain, let’s concentrate and get the job done!  Sometimes we all put our brains together.  Got problem?  Let’s get a think-tank together and think it through with our brains.  Brains get things DONE!  Thank you, brain!  \\n\\tMy thinking sometimes get stuck and my thinking thinks it is the only show in town.  I forget my brain needs a partner bigger than me. The other night I went into downtown DC to have dinner with our son, Nicholas.  I rode the Metro, Orange line to Red line to Woodley Park Station.  My brain was helpful in getting there.  As I came up the subway escalator I could hear a street musician playing a jazzy guitar tune which made me smile.  It was a warm night and Nicholas and I enjoyed eating and talking outside on a sidewalk restaurant.  As he walked me back to the subway station, he spotted his bus a half a block ahead.  If he hurried, he could make it and not have to wait for another one.  But I had been looking forward to a bit more conversation, a big hug goodbye.  Now at age 28, Nic has traveled a lot; we have said many goodbyes through the years, and he leaves for graduate school in southern California this summer.  I struggle with my own sense of Mothering Deficit here!  But there was his bus; “if you run, you can make this bus,” I said.  Nicholas gave me a quick peck on the cheek and a cheery “bye Mom, thanks for coming into tooowwwwnnnn…”  I watched him hop on the bus and move towards the back, to an empty seat.  I felt so sad in that moment it was like I couldn’t breathe.  Now my brain was telling me, “oh stop it, you will probably see him again next week….”  But my heart felt achey, and my brain kept jumping around all flustered and trying to fix the situation, plan ahead, wonder “what if.”  I turned to the entrance of the subway station with tears in my eyes.  And just as I stepped on the moving escalator going down into the station, I heard music again:  This time, the street musician was singing along with his guitar.  “don’t worry….don’t worry” he sang in a sort of reggae lilt.  Bob Marley, my brain said to myself.  “No woman, no cry….no woman, no cry…eeh ittle darling don’t shed no tears”  And just as I was moving out of hearing range, the refrain:  “Everything’s gonna be alright.  Everything’s gonna be alright.”   My brain froze.  It was like something else was trying to get my attention.  “Everything is going to be all right….Nic will have his own life, filled with adventure, tragedy and joy.  And everythings is going to be all right.” Something rearranged inside of me.   \\nIf we hadn’t hurried to catch Nic’s bus, I would have missed the song.\\n\\tI don’t think God acts in big and flashy ways.  I think the Holy Spirit is that part of God that seeps in when our brains are doing something else.  God wants to partner with us in all we do.  The Holy Spirit somehow slips through our defenses when we are overwhelmed with sadness or worry and our braininess. It usually shows up as lightly as this crepe paper rests on your shoulders.  Watch and listen.  Don’t miss the song being sung just for you.  Let it rearrange you.  Everything’s going to be alright.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tBut on that year when Chris and I lived in St. Paul, we went down to the local hardware store’s lot and looked around for a Christmas tree.  We saw nothing.  Well, there were somethings, but they sure didn’t look like Christmas trees!  What was there was a forest of these odd, skinny banchy things.  They looked like tall, spiney, green carrots, narrow standing upright in their stands, and someone had taken off that twine that the trees come all wrapped in when they come stacked in big piles in trucks from the tree farms.  But the trees looked like they were still wrapped in twine.   Instead of the branches pointing horizontally, gracefully relaxed and like the tree looks out in the forest, these branches were all bunched together and pointing vertically, straight up!  So each tree looked like a skinny green carrot, branches all tight together.  When I got closer, I realized that not only were the branches sticking straight up, but the sap in them was frozen!   The branches couldn’t move!\\n\\tThe man in the hardware store said, come back in a day or so, when it is a bit warmer, and they will have opened up.\\n\\tSo we came back the next day, and it was only a few degrees warmer, and the trees still all looked like giant green carrots.  Scrawney, ugly, frozen.  By now, I realized that we were just going to have to buy one of these things and see what happened.   The man in the store reassured us, “oh the branches will relax, once you bring it inside.”  \\n\\n\\tChris and I wandered among the huge skinny green carrot trees, trying to imagine which one would be the fullest, if it ever relaxed its branches.  But who knew if they would relax?  We had to make a decision and take an action.   Finally I shut my eyes and just stood there, waiting to be directed to something I couldn’t even imagine.  I had to take a leap of faith, trust the promise of a stranger, and imagine something – all evidence to the contrary.\\n\\tWe stuffed the tree in the back of our car and drove home.  I had my doubts about this.  We set the tree up in the living room, the tall skinny green carrot tree, and I headed to the kitchen to bake some Christmas cookies.  About a half an hour later Chris called out, “well, will you look at this!”  I came into the living room and saw that the branches had started to relax in the warmth of our home.  Within another 15 minutes the tree was open, full and beautiful.  \\n\\tSometimes it’s hard to see the promise right in front of us.  A frozen, skinny green carrot tree.   A congregation that has disagreements about how to move through and beyond a certain conflict.  A helpless baby lying in a scrappy manger in a nowhere town born to nobody parents.   It’s difficult to perceive the possibilities emerging.\\nSomeone inviting our forgiveness, or our participation in something new and challenging.  Something, deep in our hearts, urging us to change.  But we just don’t see it.  We hold back; we are unsure; we don’t commit; we want more evidence before we respond, before we take that leap into the unknown.\\n\\tWhat is the relaxed, sap flowing, green potential within and around us that may be difficult to perceive this Christmas time?  What are we unable to see or even imagine when we look out around our world?  Economic security?  Muslims who are not terrorists?  People of all religious faiths and no faith, listening to each other, learning about one another, living together in peace?  Forgiveness, re-focusing our energies and moving forward together into what God is calling us to next in this congregation?  What is difficult to picture in your mind’s eye in this moment?  What are you unable to see or imagine in your families, in your friendships, this night?   Honest conversations, deeper understanding emerging, long-time grudges disappearing? \\n\\tSometimes I think we just want to stay out in the cold by ourselves.  Maybe we are stuck, frozen, in our stubbornness, our resentments, our self-righteousness.  But God waits for us in the least expected places, waiting to inspire those openings, leaps of faith, drawing us back into the healing heat of God’s love.  God yearns to warm the sap of our spirits, to get us flowing again with self-acceptance and courage and hope.  Entering into our everyday world through the birth of Jesus, God invites us to relax our uptight selves and lower our defensive branches.   Here’s a way through, offers God.  Sit with this Jesus, listen to him, follow him.\\n“I am bringing you news of great joy,” says the angel.  “I am with you,” says God to all of us.  “Come into the warmth of my love and my purposes,” says God this precious night.  “Let the movement of my Spirit animate and guide you.”  Such is the invitation.  Merry Christmas.  Amen.   \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\\n\\tOn Easter morning one year, their Sunday school teacher had been reading them this story about the women followers of Jesus’ going to the tomb where Jesus body had been buried.   Now this was a class of 7 and 8 year olds.  Most of them were good readers and they could even think abstractly a bit.  When their teacher told them that Jesus said he was  “the light of the world,” the kids all knew Jesus wasn’t saying he was a lamp or a light bulb!  Their teacher would encourage them to listen to the beautiful poetry telling about the mystery of God.  “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,” the teacher would read from the Gospel of John.  He would ask them: “I wonder what you see when you hear that?  What do you think?”  The kids were used to thinking abstractly about Jesus.\\n\\t\\n\\tBut this morning, on Easter, the teacher just wasn’t sure what sense the children would make out of this resurrection story.  The class had been learning about how this young Jewish rabbi and traveling preacher had been healing people and challenging the religious authorities of his time.  The kids knew about how Jesus had hung out with all kinds of people considered unimportant, people assumed to be low life:  people without a lot of money, people who worked for the hated Romans, people who were sick or whose bodies were differently-abled.  The kids knew Jesus kept talking about loving your enemies, standing up to violent power and giving of oneself.  The kids in this class also knew that Jesus had been killed by Imperial Rome because he was too big of a threat to people in power.  Jesus had been hastily put in a tomb the evening he had died, and it hadn’t really been a proper burial.  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe Sunday School leader read this passage from Mark that we just heard, about some women friends of Jesus going to the tomb early in the morning to properly prepare his body with spices as was their custom before final burial.   He read to them how the big rock in front of the tomb had been moved and the tomb was empty, except for some guy dressed in white – maybe an angel – who told the confused women saying that Jesus had risen, and was alive!  “How do you explain the resurrection to 7 and 8 years olds?” the teacher wondered to himself.  \\n\\t\\n\\tSpring was just beginning in their part of the world.  The world seemed so dead, and then, suddenly, there are signs of new life springing up all around!  The teacher thought back about how many times his own life had felt like it was coming to a dead end, but how there had been love, friends, prayer, his church, new hope when he least expected it.  Hmmmm, he thought to himself.  The teacher decided to have the children go outside and find examples of new life in nature.  Maybe this would help connect them to the mystery of the resurrection.  So, he handed out some of those plastic Easter eggs that split in half.  “OK everyone,” he explained, “I want you all to go outside and look around.  Find something that represents new birth, new life in spring, and put it in your plastic egg.”  All the children, including Stephen, were excited to get outside and look around the churchyard and they wondered what they might discover.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhen the children all bustled inside again, the teacher put all their egg-like plastic containers on the table.  He looked at Stephen, who had a little crick of a smile on his face.  The teacher had no idea if Stephen had understood what he was talking about or if the boy knew what to do with his egg.  Tentatively, the teacher opened the first egg and out tumbled a tiny flower.  “That’s mine,” exclaimed one of the other boys.  “New life growing up out of the ground! ” said the teacher.  The next egg had a rock in it, and the teacher wondered to himself, “oh, no this must be Stephen’s.”  But a little girl shouted, “that’s mine!  See it has fuzzy moss on the bottom of it – new life!”  Another egg held some blades of grass, another contained a squiggly earthworm.  But the next egg the teacher opened had nothing in it.  He paused…and started to reach for another egg.  Just then Stephen spoke up: “wait, don’t skip mine!”  “But Stephen,” the teacher gently replied, “your egg is empty.”  “Yeah, empty!  Just like Jesus’ tomb and that means new life for us,” exclaimed Stephen.\\n\\t\\n\\tHow is it that out of emptiness, new life emerges?  It’s an idea that just doesn’t make sense.  It grates against our predominate culture that tells us that “full” is always better than “empty.”  A full bank account, a full refrigerator.  A full-time job is best, a full heart is preferable.  And these are nothing to scoff at because “empty” can bring enormous suffering.  An empty wallet, empty plates at the table, not good.   Same with empty stomachs, empty house, empty heart.  But one of the problems with living in a world that celebrates “full” over “empty” is that we begin to think “empty” is the end of the story.  A failure or mistake means we are a complete looser. Death of a beloved means we will never know love again. A missed opportunity obliterates all hope.  \\n\\nYet, what the women on that Easter morning discover is that this empty tomb turns these assumptions upside-down.  Their teacher and friend was dead and is now alive.  This was not some idea to be affirmed or denied; it is an immense energy that will eventually propel these women back into their lives in a whole new way.   After fear and amazement will come an awareness of Jesus’ living presence among them, encouraging and emboldening them.  They will become proclaimers of good news that death is not necessarily the end to life. Empty is not the end of the story, and, curiously, self-emptying will be the way to abundant life in the present.   “Go and tell the other disciples,” says the radiant creature in the empty tomb.  “Jesus has gone ahead of you, up in Galilee like he promised.  He’s out in the world in a new way.”   Empty is not the end of the story.\\n\\t\\n\\tAt Easter, you and I are reminded that there is a parallel universe to all that seems so important in our visible world.  It’s the unseen universe of God’s persistent attention and love that says that tragedy, despair, even death are not the last word.  And God is continually bringing new possibilities and hope to us while we live and even after we die.  In some strange sense, the Christian Church claims that with Easter, death is now dead.  In emptiness, paradoxically, there can be the power of new life. The empty places in our lives may actually become cleared ground.  They can become the wide-open space that God needs for new growth within us, for re-focused priorities, for change.  This is a huge thing to claim and we can spend a lifetime absorbing this mysterious reality.  And so we begin again.  Christ is Risen.  Thanks be to God.  Alleluia and Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\t    \\n\\n(Note:  The story of Stephen and the empty egg container has circulated on the web for years, although its origin is unknown.)  \\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tWe heard a lot about sheep and shepherds in our scripture readings just now.   In the Psalm reading, God is compared to a shepherd who watches over us, leads us to places of rest and food.  In the Gospel of John piece, Jesus is concluding an argument with some Jerusalem religious leaders about his healing of a blind person on the Sabbath.  Jesus speaks of himself as a good shepherd, and how his sheep know his voice.  He is the protector for the sheep, like the gate that protects them at night from wild animals.  \\n\\n\\tWe might assume that these are familiar and cozy metaphors for the caring nature of both God and Jesus. But besides maybe seeing sheep at the State Fair, how many of us have spent much time around sheep and their shepherds?  I know I haven’t.  And how do you like being compared to a sheep?  I’m not sure how I feel about that myself.  Aren’t sheep sort of dumb, always wandering off and getting lost?  To make things even more confusing, church members often assume that their pastors are supposed lead their churches like shepherds.   The word pastor comes from the word pasture, pastoral.   Lead your flock to still waters and green pastures, Anne!  Always be ready to save the sheep; lay down your life for your sheep!  I must admit that this sounds hard and exhausting.  I’m not sure, as your pastor, that I am willing to do that!  Is this what is expected of a pastor these days?  Sheep, shepherds.   God and Jesus.  Let’s see if we can make some sense out of this.  \\n\\n\\tFirst of all, can we seriously compare people to sheep?  How helpful is this?  Most of us think of sheep are unruly and dumb.  But that might not be the whole story.  In Jesus time, and thousands of years before that, sheep were important for wool, meat and milk.   Sheep apparently like to hang out together, which made it easier for humans to herd them.  Their eyes are on top of their heads and they walk with a funny zigzag that lets them see behind them all the time.  Watching out for a wolf!  They have four stomachs that means they can digest all kinds of stuff we could never eat, like grass and weeds.  At night they would be all penned up with other flocks, but they were smart enough to know their masters voice, and would come to the particular shepherd in the morning to head out to pasture together.  All considered, perhaps it is not a bad thing to be a sheep.  Maybe it’s okay to be compared to a sheep.  \\n\\n\\tBut am I supposed to be your shepherd?  When your yet-to-be-formed Pastoral Search Committee finds a new called pastor, will that person be expected to be your new shepherd?   I mentioned in our weekly email, the TAB, this last Thursday that much church conflict is focused on the expectations of the congregation of their pastor.  Problems arise when those expectations are not identified and discussed.  Or when the expectations are clear but not met.  In the months to come, I will be inviting us to explore your expectations of clergy leadership in today’s church.  We may notice there are generational differences among us in these shifting expectations.  It will be good to get clear about this before a Pastoral Search Committee is formed and empowered to select a new pastor for this church.  \\n\\n\\tLet’s think some about this shepherd image.  Is your pastor supposed to be a good shepherd among you?  Leading, protecting, saving?  I used to think so myself, but then I heard this story about a certain sheepdog named Esau.  This story has become well known in churches around the country, and was even shared in our Women’s Fellowship group devotional a few months ago.  It’s worth repeating, because it may help us make sense out of how we can work together better in the church.  Pastor and people.\\t\\n\\n\\tNow, Esau’s human was The Rev. M. Craig Barnes, a long-time Presbyterian church pastor, until he recently became President of Princeton Seminary.  Esau is actually a bearded collie, a type of Scottish sheepdog.  Now Pastor Craig knew his Bible, and he used to think that he too was called to be a shepherd of his church flock.   But, one day, he started paying closer attention to his sheepdog Esau.  He started noticing a few things.\\n\\t\\n\\tHe observed that everyday, on their morning walks, Esau would sniff all around and happily wag his tail. Cloudy or sunny day, it didn’t matter.  Same thing.  Happy to be alive!  “Hmmm,” thought Pastor Craig, “I wonder if I’m supposed to be the one who is to keep paying attention to the goodness all around us and remind people about it.   God’s grace is always in the air!  This is part of my job.”  As I think about my own work among you, I realize this may be part of why I invite us to share some joys and delights before starting each church meeting.\\n\\n\\tThen, when Pastor Craig and his family would go to the beach, Esau would try to herd the birds.  Not by running straight at them, in a head-on confrontation, but by coming in slant.  “Ahhh” thought Pastor Craig, “I might try that more often with my congregation.”  Not by confronting issues or changes straight on, but more subtly, on a slant.  So, I shouldn’t demand that you all stop arguing about Sanctuary furniture.  It’s my role to suggest that we have some respectful conversation about what we do in worship, its purpose, and how different kinds of furniture like pews, altar, Communion table, pulpit help us in our worship.\\n\\n\\tPastor Craig also noticed that Esau would not go to bed until everyone in the house came upstairs to their bedrooms.   The sheepdog stays awake until everyone is gathered in.   I’ve thought about that whenever I’m the last one out of the building, locking the door, watching you all get in your cars in the dark following a night meeting.\\n\\n\\tI was also intrigued by what Pastor Craig learned with Esau at the dog park.  Pastor Craig finally realized that the dog park was not really fun for Esau, because Esau kept trying to round up the other dogs.  “Yes,” thought Pastor Craig, “my work in ministry is not always fun and games.   Pastors need to worry about the order and well being of the whole community.  My delight is not to be in chasing Frisbees” but “in helping others gather around the Good shepherd.”   I think this has to do with ministerial boundaries and ethics.  I am your pastor not in order to get my needs met, but to be of service.  We should all be able to have some fun in doing this.  But.  Most cases of pastoral misconduct begin with a clergyperson seeking to get his or her emotional needs, friendship and support needs, met by someone or a group in the congregation.\\n\\n\\tAt this point in his pondering, Pastor Craig started to wonder:  “Maybe I’m supposed to be more like a sheepdog, than the shepherd.”  He even went to watch some other border collies at some sheep herding trials.  Sheepdogs practice herding the sheep, as guided by the shepherd.\\nHe noticed how the dogs didn’t bark much or make a lot of fuss.  The sheepdogs would actually spend quite a bit of time sitting still and looking at the shepherd.  “These dogs are faithful agents of another mind,” Rev. Craig thought to himself.  “Always obedient to the master’s, the shepherd’s directive will.”  He realized that the shepherd was the center of the sheep dogs life, not the sheep.  And the only way the sheepdog keeps up this good, herding work is because it frequently sits down, is very still and intently watches the master, the shepherd.  Not only that, but the sheepdog rests when the day is done.  “That’s it,” Pastor Craig admitted to himself.  “My job as a pastor is to nudge the sheep towards the only savior of the flock!  Jesus, the Good Shepherd who lays down HIS life for his sheep.”  \\t\\n\\n\\tI have found this very helpful as I think about my role as pastor.  I am not to be your shepherd.  I am to be like a good sheepdog.  I am to sit still and watch and listen to the master shepherd, Jesus.  It is my job to pay attention to Jesus’ teachings, listen to his Spirit speak in my heart.  Can you, will you, hold me accountable to that?   Ask me how I am doing in paying attention to the master shepherd in my own life.\\n\\n\\tI realize I am also to do all this without barking or fussing or ostentatious displays of authority.  I am to try to lovingly nip at all of your heels.  I am to gently, firmly herd you back to the Good Shepherd.  Am I barking or fussing or throwing my weight around too much as pastor?  I need the feedback!\\n\\n\\tPerhaps most of all, I am grateful to Pastor Craig for reminding me that I too am just one of God’s creatures.  I am an animal in this analogy, just like each of you.  I’m just a dog.  I don’t save anyone; that’s up to God.  \\n\\tWe are all learning to understand what the Shepherd wants us to do with our precious lives.  Sheep and sheepdog, working together:  not a bad metaphor for church.  All following the one who is both Good Shepherd and Lord.\\nThanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:  Inspiration for the “pastor as sheepdog” image is from an article by M. Craig Barnes, “The Good Sheepdog,” Christian Century, February 2, 2012. \\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tIt’s the end of Thanksgiving weekend.  Having just pushed back from turkey feasting and piles of dishes, Black Friday sales and endless football, we encounter the Advent season.  But the first Sunday in Advent seems to get us nowhere near the baby Jesus in a manger.   Instead, we are led deep into Jesus’ foreboding apocalyptic-style monologue in this Matthew passage.  Somber words about a future unknown time.  What are we to make of this?  \\n\\tThe Latin origin of the word “advent” means “coming” or “emerging.” Both texts this morning hint that something is coming, emerging, towards us.  “That’s for sure,” we may mutter to ourselves.  We see what’s coming towards us: a frenetic time of gift buying, endless cooking and baking, ramped up church activities, Christmas card writing, house-guests, traveling to see relatives, ampted-up children and grandkids, all the while juggling other people’s expections.   As much as many of us adore this winter season, it can be overwhelming to even think about.  Is it January yet?\\nOur wider consumer culture does not acknowledge the Advent season; this church time is not flashy, the hymns are somber, it doesn’t lend itself to marketing ploys.  In the quiet bareness of one single lit candle, the beginning of Advent brings us to into a “new cycle of old ideas stirred up in us again.”  (Joan Chittister, The Liturgical Year:  The Spiraling Adventure of the Spiritual Life, p. 63.)   A repeated spiraling in on an ancient view of things unseen.  We move in and out of this parallel universe during December.  I find that the perspectives and practices of Advent help me make better choices in the wider commercial world of so many holiday “shoulds” and overwhelm.  The scriptures and music, the times of quiet focus during Advent remind me that God is ever pressing in our own very souls (Evelyn Underhill).  Seeking closeness, intimacy with us.  Subtly, below the surface.   As the 20th century Anglican mystic Evelyn Underhill put it:  “A tremendous spiritual event took place” in the birth of Jesus.  “But there was little to show for it on the surface of life….and this contrast between the outward appearance and the inner reality is true of all the coming of God to us.  We must be very loving and very alert if we want to recognize them in their earthly disguise.” (p. 1, Advent with EU).\\n\\tHow to stay very loving and very alert through a busy December?  We pay attention to the texts.  In today’s Gospel from Matthew, Jesus has just made oblique references to the fall of the Jerusalem temple and the “Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”  All of this makes his disciples very nervous.  Jesus’ words are in the style of apolocalypic, end times writings found in the Hebrew scriptures of that period.  The “son of man” was a human who would come as God’s agent at the end of time, when God would judge, re-create and heal the world as God intended it originally.  Jesus launches into a series of disturbing images:  the mythic flood story of Noah’s debauched era, a kidnap story where one person working in the field is taken and the other is not, and finally a thief story where the householder hasn’t bothered to stay awake and gets robbed.  Unsettling! “You must also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour,” intones Jesus.  \\n\\tWe are to be ready for what? Is it a final judgement that will happen at the end of human time, when God sorts through good and bad people at the end of the world?  “Behold, the end is near!” warn the fundamentalist Christians, as depicted in the harrowing “Left Behind” series.  Or, is Jesus speaking of a judgement that awaits us at the time of our death, as God weighs our sins to determine if we go to eternal reward or eternal punishment?    For most of us more liberal and progressive Christians, both the end-of-world or the end-of-my-life-time scenario seems like scare tactics.  The idea of a judging, punitive God offends our intellect, and passages like this give us the whillies.  What “day and hour” is Jesus talking about?…this time that neither angels, Jesus nor the rest of us can predict?  I’d rather wrestle with a mess of Christmas tree lights, than try to untangle this web of grim images. \\n\\tIt occurs to me that the first Sunday in Advent is not solely about a run up to the familiar nativity stories.  The Apostle Paul writes to his congregation in Rome, sometime in mid-first century:  “besides this, all this about loving your neighbor that I just wrote about in the preceeding sentences of my letter, besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep.”  Are we asleep?  Wake up to what?  What time is it? Advent reminds us of a understanding of time.  It’s about a long-view, a wider cosmic coming of the God’s reign on earth.  It’s happening now, but it hasn’t happened yet.  We are inbetween times.  And this is not immediately apparent in the world around us.\\n\\t \\nThis kind of Biblical writing has certainly been misunderstood and misappropriated through the centuries. The word “apocalypse” actually means ‘uncovering’ or ‘revealing’ the real truth hidden beneath the surface.  It has little to do with the Hollywood film visions of exploding cities and massive casualties.  These allegorical, mythical images are meant to reveal God’s mysterious workings that lie beneath troubling current events.  Jesus speaks of people in Noah’s time simply living their lives: eating and drinking, getting married.  Nothing judgemental is said about their behavior.  Same with the two women grinding their wheat.  Business as usual….but maybe settling too comfortably into day-to-day life.  Perhaps Jesus is not talking about God judging and sorting people at the end of time.  Nor is he implying that God does this when we each die.  I wonder if Jesus was implying that God’s discernment, loving eye towards who we are, God’s merciful judgement, is an everyday occurance?  Not because God wants to punish me when I screw up, but because God loves me so incredibly and longs for my transformation.  That’s why God keeps an eye on me, cautions me, holds me accountable.   I must be “very loving and very alert” to see this and to work with God’s merciful and transformative daily judging of me.\\n\\t “You know what time it is,” says Paul, “how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep, for salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near!”  Salvation here isn’t meant to be an instant ticket to heaven.  Paul saw it as a transformational process, in which we learn to be loving and alert to God’s movement among us.  Eugene Peterson’s paraphrase of the Book of Romans, called The Message, puts Paul’s opening words this way:  “Be up and awake to what God is doing!”  Peterson takes Paul’s curious instruction about “put on the Lord Jesus Christ” and rephrases it with refreshing bluntness:  “get up and get dressed!” Now here is something I can work with, knowing full well how much more alert we feel about day after we have managed to get up and get dressed.  But here’s the catch:  “Dress yourselves in Christ!”  “Christ” – the Greek word for the Hebrew “Messiah.”  Dress yourself in the “Messiah,”  in the Christ, the promised one in Jewish tradition who brings about God’s reign of justice, mercy and hope.  Dress yourself in that loving action.  Don’t just get dressed any old which way, cautions Peterson.  Watch out for those “old garments” that we habitually put on in our lives!  Now there’s  an interesting Advent practice: what are the old clothes of our psyches that just don’t fit anymore, the ways we clothe or present ourselves that just don’t serve us any more?  Do I clothe myself in cyncisim?  Constant remorse?  Ask yourself, am I clothed in Hopelessness?  Perpetual blaming of others?  Seeming scattered or always in an overwhelmed rush?  Am I clothed in calm, in love, in alertness?  Paul has a few dramatic suggestions of what these “old garments” might be, like drunkenness, debauchery and licentiousness, easily dismissable for most of us.  But then he follows with the more subtle temptations of quarreling and jealously which probably nails most of us.   “Put on the garments of light, not darkness” says Paul.\\nMaybe this is how we can practice Advent, in a world that seems dark and far from healed.  We don’t wait to just feel it differently; we practice a different way of being in the world.  We stay very loving and very alert in this in-between time.  And the bigger picture of God’s hope-filled intentions slowly begins to take root inside of us.   A blessed Advent to us all.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSEE FEASTING BLUE BOOK\\nFor whether prepared or unprepared, Christ always comes at unawares. Not even exempting himself, Jesus says, \"No one\\xa0knows the day or the hour.\" And this is inescapably unsettling. God\\'s mercy may temper our fear, but it does not and should not remove it. For God\\'s love for the vulnerable is the fierce love of a mother, and God\\'s desire to protect all of God\\'s children is the determined love of a father.\\nThere is a scene in C. S. Lewis\\'\\xa0The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\xa0where the children, learning that Aslan is not a man but a lion are not only startled but down right alarmed. \"Is he -- quite safe?\" Susan asks. \"I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.\" \"That you will, dearie, and no mistake,\" replies Mrs. Beaver, \"if there\\'s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they\\'re either braver than most or else silly.\" \"Then he isn\\'t safe?\" Lucy asks. To which Mr. Beaver responds, \"Safe? Don\\'t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \\'Course he isn\\'t safe. But he\\'s good. He\\'s the King, I tell you.\"\\nSafe? The God of fierce love and determined mercy? The God of unlooked for judgment and unrelenting justice? Of course he isn\\'t safe. But he\\'s good. And knowing that makes all the difference.\\nThank you for proclaiming the wild grace of this frighteningly merciful God, Working Preacher. Because sometimes I need to be startled out of the comfortable daydream in which I have unintentionally trapped the biblical God. And through your preaching of the God who comes both as king and thief both my expectations and my hopes are simultaneously unsettled and enlarged. Which is, I suspect, just what I need at the beginning of a new year.\\nYours in Christ,\\nDavid http://www.workingpreacher.org/craft.aspx?post=1560\\n\\n\\n\\nThe apostle Paul says that we know what time it is, because we are awaking from sleep.  \\n© Jan Richardson. janrichardson.com.”\\nhttp://paintedprayerbook.com/\\nWe are moving through a season that holds such tender markers for me, anniversaries that echo with deep sorrow instead of celebration. We have passed Halloween, the day that holds the beginnings of who Gary and I became together. His fateful surgery was November 14. His birthday—he spent his final one in the hospital—is November 17. December 2 will mark three years since Gary died.\\nThe span of time since Gary’s death feels both surprisingly short and achingly long. These days of memory, these anniversary days I am moving through, heighten that sense of the shortness-and-longness of time, making me more keenly aware of the ways that time compresses even as it stretches out, fluid even in its seeming fixity.\\nFrom the moment the neurosurgeon came into the waiting room at 4 a.m. and said,\\xa0It did not go as we anticipated,\\xa0time has moved in strange ways. I have come to think of this strangeness as a consequence of having a heart that now lives in two worlds, a heart that has been torn open toward eternity even as I continue to open my heart to this life, to what is here and now.\\nIn the strangeness of time, there is deep grace. And perhaps the strangeness itself is a grace. Perhaps the strangeness is a sign that time is wider and deeper and more whole than we can perceive in this life, that\\xa0now\\xa0and\\xa0eternity\\xa0are not the separate realms we often make them out to be.\\nWhen we travel through days of memory that stir our sorrow, when we spiral back around moments that open doors to a past we wish we had the power to change, when time seems more of a burden than a blessing, may we be given a glimpse of the eternity these days hold. May these anniversaries show us that grace and love are vaster than our sorrow, and more enduring. May we find that remembering can be a form of hope. May we know time’s strange graces and open our hearts toward the solace they hold.\\nBlessing When the World is Ending\\nLook, the world is always ending somewhere.\\nSomewhere the sun has come crashing down.\\nSomewhere it has gone completely dark.\\nSomewhere it has ended with the gun, the knife, the fist.\\nSomewhere it has ended with the slammed door, the shattered hope.\\nSomewhere it has ended with the utter quiet that follows the news from the phone, the television, the hospital room. \\nSomewhere ithas ended with a tenderness that will break your heart.\\nBut, listen, this blessing means to be anything but morose.  It has not come to cause despair.\\nIt is simply here because there is nothing a blessing is more suited for than an ending, nothing that cries out more for blessing than when a world is falling apart.\\nThis blessing will not fix you, will not mend you, will not give you false comfort; it will not talk to you about one door opening when another one closes.\\nIt will simply sit itself beside you among the shards and gently turn your face toward the direction from which the light will come, gathering itself about you as the world begins again.\\nJan Richardson, “Circle of Grace”\\n—Jan Richardson\\nfrom\\xa0Circle of Grace\\n',\n",
       " '\\tMy name is Luke. And I am deeply honored to be invited to speak with you today and to share this pulpit with my esteemed colleagues and fellow gospel writers, Mark, Matthew and John. I never met Mark, though both Matthew and I have read and used his teachings extensively. Some scholars think Mark may have met Jesus when Mark was a young boy. Which may explain Mark’s sense of urgency, the strong expectation that Jesus was to return any moment and usher in the end of time -   the immediacy of Jesus’ compelling presence fills Mark’s gospel. As I listened to Matthew speak with you last week, I was again inspired by his conviction: God’s mighty works happened throughout Jesus’ life and they are happening in our midst this very moment! Such a message is truly important to me, and yet I am so different from Mark and Matthew. They were both Jews who became followers of Christ, and they have both been nurtured and raised on the laws of and teachings of Judaism. I came from outside that family. My own parents were gentiles by birth: Greek is our native tongue.  No one is quite sure where I’m from, but suffice it to say I was a companion of the apostle Paul on his many missions (all those letters in the New Testament to young churches? Paul wrote those).  Actually, I’m a physician by trade. I wrote my gospel in a church that Paul helped start. It is incredible to me that something I wrote in 70’s A.D. has survived to this day! I’m glad it did, because I had a specific purpose in mind. \\n\\tI wanted to set forth my theory of the whole sweep of history, not just Jewish history.  A grandiose endeavor, I admit.  But I wanted to explain the place of Jesus and the church in God’s overall purpose for all of humanity.  That’s why I also wrote the Book of Acts, by the way, which tells about the spread of the early Jesus followers.  Matthew, and especially Mark, thought Jesus was going to return soon…possibly in their lifetime. By the time I wrote my book, it was very important to help people understand why Jesus had not returned yet. This was a real crisis for followers of the Jesus Way. Frankly, I think a lot people misread what Jesus was talking about when he mentioned the final judgment, the end of time. You have to remember during this era there were all sorts of strange and wild ideas about “the end of time” floating around. There were all kinds of Roman mystery religions and cults, soothsayers, and astrologers from the East….even Jewish writings about the apocalypse, like the book of Daniel. Add to this heady brew a very tumultuous political situation, with a lot of oppression from Rome, many people simply hoped that the end was near as an escape.\\n\\tBut as we all know now, the end of the world wasn’t near.  Returning in judgment at the end wasn’t why Jesus really came anyway, in my view. He came to begin changes in the present. People all through the centuries have thought Christianity was about the future, getting to heaven after you die, and that this life was merely transitional and didn’t matter much. Jesus would have been appalled by this view.  Being a good Jew, he focused on bringing about God’s purpose of peace and justice for humanity.  Here’s how I make sense of all this:  we are now midpoint in the long-range vision of God’s purpose.  God has a lot going on this world, with a lot of different people, in my view.  Part of the drama began with God’s connection with ancient Israel and continued up to John the Baptist. This may surprise you, but that wild-man prophet still had a lot of followers long after he died. The reason I describe John the Baptist’s parents, conception, birth and ministry so carefully is to show that he was important, but not as important as Jesus. John the Baptist announces and ushers in the earthly ministry of Jesus, in which the promised redemption of God really cranks up. \\nWhat do I mean by redemption? I don’t mean that everybody’s souls suddenly get clean and are headed for heaven. One of the first public events I record about Jesus is his presence in the synagogue in his hometown, Nazareth. The order of worship included time for guests to comment on the reading scriptures. A passage from Isaiah had just been read about God’s promised redemption: “good news to the poor, release to the captives, deliverance for the oppressed.”  This sounds like the song Mary sang when she visited Elizabeth, with Jesus in utero!  On the day of this Torah reading, Jesus stood up and said, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing”. (Luke 4:21).\\n\\tThe reason I wrote my book is that I was convinced that the church, the worshipping community of believers and seekers, was God’s instrument for redemption. God’s purpose is not that we have happy, private lives, living comfortably, and then to die and go to heaven. God’s purpose is that we enjoy God’s creation, and that we make it possible for all of humanity to enjoy the gifts of creation. I don’t know…maybe its because I’m a doctor…I’ve seen so much suffering, disease, battle wounds, malnutrition. I know in my gut this is not how God planned for us to live!\\n\\tI wanted to show my own worshipping community how to break through their resistances to becoming part of the redemptive work. I had to show them that God cuts through their stereotypes of who is worthy of their help and care.  This comes out in the way I wrote Jesus’ birth stories, which are different from Matthew’s.  I focused a lot of pages on how God births God’s messenger and son through the nobody Mary.  I guess that’s why I also included shepherds in these narratives.  To you modern romantics, shepherds may take on the gentleness of their flocks, humble, lowly men.  Not so!  In my time, shepherds were considered “low life”, dishonest, dirty and outside the law. I included the visitation of the angel host to the shepherds to remind everyone who Jesus really came to save. Not just people who are more evil than you or me, but people who are considered outside the fold of “proper” society and religious convention. What would this look like today?  Perhaps angelic messengers of God appearing to a Guatemalan migrant family on farm in Central Minnesota, to the meth dealer in the Twin Cities, to Somali refugees in St. Cloud, to the homeless person on the streets of Duluth, to the tattooed and multiply pierced young person in Grand Marais, the people on the other side of the aisle in current impeachment debate, people on different sides of a church conflict!  People outside of your sphere of acceptance, for whatever reason. This can be startling and unnerving news: God speaks and works through those people we least expect…often it is our “enemy”.  Makes me wonder how God might be working through this whole impeachment process you’ve got going right now….think about it….who seems like your “enemy” right now?\\n\\tConsider why I recorded Mary’s incredible song which she sang to her cousin Elizabeth. “My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my savior, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden”. She was not from a very good family…to be blunt. She came from a real low life crowd herself, poor and illiterate. Her song continues, “For God has shown strength with God’s arm, God has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts, God has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low decree. God has filled the hungry with good things and the rich God has sent empty away”. \\nDo you get why I included this long passage?  Jesus was big on seeking out the “lost” people of his time.  This song is a foreshadowing of Jesus’ ministry…of his compassion for the tax collectors, the prostitutes, Samaritans, the sick, children, women and those living in poverty. All the people who really did not matter in my society…those who were ignored and considered to be failures, worthless……and in some way, dangerous.\\n\\tThis is why I wrote my book…to tell about the Jesus who preached good news to the lost…to those on the edge. I wrote to tell my community that they were to continue Jesus’ ministry among the lost, the poor, and the needy, because this is part of God’s plan for the redemption of the world! I speak to you today to remind you that this is your work too as followers of Jesus.  My prayer is that you continue to be bold in this ministry!  A blessed Christmas to each of you. Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tGod’s overwhelming otherness is what Isaiah experienced in his temple vision of the shaking, smoke-filled room and the hem of God’s garment spilling out over the inner sanctum.  These dragon-like creatures flying through the air, smoke, the whole room shaking!.   A bit terrifying to contemplate. And amazingly, the creatures are singing praises to God, the same words Christians eventually will sing during Holy Communion!  “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; heaven and earth are full of your glory.”  Words you and I eventually echo in our celebration of Communion!  \\n\\tFor Isaiah, it was a blinding majesty that made him feel insignificant, lost, unclean. Suddenly the fixed, static world was swimming before his field of vision.  Was he hallucinating or did he perceive a world that is more dynamic, more filled with movement and changing than we normally perceive?    Yet in the midst of the mayhem of this wild scene, God reaches out through the burning yet tender touch of the seraph and a hot coal.  “No Isaiah, you are not lost.  Your guilt has departed you and your sin is blotted out….I need to use you for my work of justice and healing….will you go?”  \\n\\tWe are so small and insignificant in the scope of things, and yet this Mysterious Creator is mindful of us, wants to partner with us. This tension between the grandeur, the holy otherness of our Creator God, and the closeness and intimacy of this loving God, has always been hard to explain.  It took the Christian church about 300 years to formulate this symbolic language of the Trinity, which I think was in part an attempt to make sense about of these different ways we experience God.  The idea of the Trinity, God as Father, Son and Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit was stimulated by considerable controversy about Jesus himself.  Who was he?  Divine or human?  Who is Jesus now as Risen Messiah, the Risen Christ, in our midst? The concept of the Trinity, is like any doctrine or creed in any religion: it is symbolic language that tries to describe a great Mystery.\\t  \\n\\tThe story from John’s Gospel brings us some 700 years later, to an early point in Jesus ministry.  The Pharisee Nicodemus was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders and he shows up several times in John’s gospel.  Some think he was cowardly and only approached Jesus  under the cover of darkness, perhaps fearful that he would be ridiculed or even persecuted by his colleagues.  But Jewish rabbis used to teach that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the marvel of the text.  Perhaps Nicodemus was a true seeker, had been paying attention to Jesus teaching and healing work, and now came to “study” him, in the quiet of the night (Patricia Farris, Christian Century, Jan. 30-Feb. 6, 2002).   \\n\\tBut in the end, Nicodemus seems almost too careful and cautious.  He starts by politely acknowledging Jesus is from God, because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  But Jesus was not big on people who believed in him just because of fancy signs and miracles.  Jesus replies to Nicodemus’ overly cautious compliments with a curious and curt pronouncement:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born “from above” or “being born again.”    The Gospel writer John uses a word that has double meaning in Greek:  anothen means both “from above” and it means “again or anew.”  Unfortunately, most Bibles chose one meaning or the other and we lose this intentionally ambiguous reply and meaning of Jesus.  It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem.”  This should get our attention big time.  The terrifying scene of God’s overwhelming presence in the temple was not just as it seemed.  God reached out to touch Isaiah right where he needed it:  in his lostness and his sense of wrongness, sinfulness.  “Dig deeper… Jesus is suggesting to Nicodemus….you must be born again….but things are not as they seem.”  Jesus is trying to tell him that fuller connection, intimacy, with God means both a reorientation in place and in time.  “The Kindgom of God” is a place (of justice, peace and healing).  The Kingdom of God is also a time (bursting into this present moment).  Notice there is nothing here about being born again so you can go to heaven in the future.  New birth is going to give a new kind of connection with God in the present moment; this is where Jesus is going with “born from above/born again.”  It’s as though he is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension.  But Nicodemus can’t see or imagine it, and he appears to become more and more confused.  He gets stuck in one literal meaning, “how can you go back into your mother’s womb.”  He just can’t grasp that Jesus is using poetic language to talk about a transformative experience of the living God.  And it starts with knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to Jesus in that moment; with Jesus right in front of him!\\n\\tI invite you to explore the mystery of the Trinity this week, of the three-in-one ways God shows up in our world.  Notice where you might be getting stuck in some literal interpretation of scripture or doctrine, like Nichodeumus.  Think mystery, awe, wonder and pay attention to what is right in front of you.  Watch for moments when you sense of hugeness, the grandeur, the otherness of God our Creator, and loving Parent, Father, Mother.  Notice when you remember the teachings and person of Jesus who stayed up late one night to talk with a seeker, perhaps a seeker like you.  Pay attention to the moment when you feel infused with the enlivening action of the Holy Spirit – the presence of the Risen Christ in your midst.  Soak in these fleeting awarenesses; know that God is with you always as Loving Creator, Redeemer, Sustainer.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.  \\n\\t \\n',\n",
       " '\\t“Wait, and don’t wait!?!” If this sermon title doesn’t send out a mixed message, I’m not sure what does!  None of us really like to get mixed messages.  The economy is improving but more people are unemployed and house values still fall!  Or how about one alittle closer to home: those mixed messages we give and receive in personal relationships.  Words or actions that invite us to come closer one minute and then push us away the next!  Mixed or ambiguous messages become most difficult when we have a lot of emotion or meaning invested:  Such as in the statement that can sound like either Good news or Bad news: we don’t take the Bible literally but we take it seriously as a guide to faith!  Ambiguity when it comes to the Bible and religious faith seems to be contradictory!  B the older we get, the more we are aware that life itself is full of perplexing ambiguities.  The bedrock assurances we assumed as children are eventually challenged:  We see bad things happen to good people.  Life is not always far and failure cannot always be avoided.  That honesty and steadfastness is not consistently rewarded, that parents are falible and evil often goes unpunished.  As much as we yearn for the simple and unshaken faith, we learn that our faith and understanding of the complexities God’s world have to grow as we mature.  And as we grow older, we yearn for a deepened, more expansive religious faith that will help us deal with these ambiguities, the grey areas of life where things are not always black and white clear. \\n\\tI have found the season of Advent to be a helpful incubator for such a Biblical faith that can address the ambiguities of life.   While the rest of the commercial world is frenetically pushing us to focus on material acquistion, to give and get more and more things, the church prepares for Jesus birth in an oddly quiet and stark way.   Some of our cues from the natural world around us, as the leaves finally shed their colorful leaves and their branches now stand stark against the early darkening sky.  The earth appears to quiet-down and turn inward as it waits for spring.  We would do well to find such moments for ourselves in this time.  In all that will fill these next four weeks before Christmas, we might find those moments when we simply stand still, rooted on the ground, drinking in the stillness, stretching our limbs out into God’s quiet mystery.   \\nOur other cue for a different kind of rhythm in the Christmas season is from Holy Scripture.  Now the Advent Bible readings can seem quite jarring, however, especially on the first Sunday in Advent.  The prophet Isaiah lamenting his people’s capture and exile to Babylon; the anger and pleading with God that pains us to hear.  We turn to the Gospel of Mark, hoping for a hint of the joyful angels singing and sweet baby in the manger.  Instead, we encounter this these foreboding apocalyptic, end-times sayings of Jesus, spoken right before his arrest.  Just as we are beginning to pull out our Christmas decorations, with their sentimental associations and memories, its like getting a glass of cold water in the face.  Writing in the 6th century BC, Isaiah gives voices to the suffering of his people following the destruction of the whole city of Jerusalem and their primary worship center, the Temple.  God where are you?  “there is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and delivered us into the hand of iniquity.”  And the Gospel writer Mark doesn’t even give us a birth story about Jesus like the other Gospels.  Oddly enough, Advent always begins with these passages about Israel’s sense of God’s desertion and Jesus’ describing the end times, when the whole earth will convulse and the heavens will break their cycle of days; distant stars, tiny blades of grass, everything will be affected when the Son of Man returns.  \\nPart of why I suggested that we leave our Sanctuary bare for this first Sunday of Advent, except for the Advent candle wreath and its one small flame, is to highlight the starkness of these passages.  Such a contrast to the community around us, that is already bedecked with Christmas lights and Santa Clauses.  Here, in this simple Sanctuary, we face the beginning of an unromanticized Christmas story, with no hint of tinsel trappings or the coming festivities.   Frankly, I find that to be a relief for the moment.  I treasure this slow pace of Advent, as the twilight deepens earlier each afternoon and the temperatures drop.  I step out in the early morning and see the hoar-frost on the grass, the mist in the bare trees, the earth around me slowing down and descending into winter. Nature moves into a time of deep waiting, ruminating and regenerating towards a distant spring that will come, but not yet.  Wait, says Advent, God is going to show up in places we do not expect.  “Yet, O Lord, you are our loving Parent; we are the clay and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand,” wrote Isaiah, hope arising out of his despair. \\nSo, in Advent, we learn about waiting and we wait.  And yet, at the same time, we are admonished to NOT wait.  “Keep alert,” said Jesus, “ for you do not know when the time will come.”  Using a parable of a man going on a journey and leaving his servants in charge of his household, Jesus cautions us to “keep awake,” for we do not know what the master will return.   Now, here is the ambiguous part:  Jesus teaches that we must both wait for God’s coming and stay active at the same time.  I remember when I was in seminary, a friend of mine had a T-shirt that read:  “The end of the world is near, Jesus is returning; look busy!”   Maybe a more direct way to get to the heart of the matter is this:  if you were certain that the world as you know it is going to end tomorrow, what would you be doing today?  It’s one of those “bucket list” kind of questions that force us to consider what is most important in our lives.  When asked this same question, the Protestant Reformer Martin Luther apparently replied, “I would plant a tree.”  Advent cues us to consider how we are to stay engaged within the household of God; not just busy for busy sake, in order to look good.  But what are the purposes to which God calls us in this time, where do my yearnings and responsibilities lie?  What should I NOT wait for any longer?  What will I do with this one precious life that I have been given?  If not now, then when?   What does it mean for me to truly “stay awake, alert” in the greater household of God?  \\nOnce again during Advent, we claim that God is at work in this world in spite of the evidence.   As we move through our crowded days, a part of us stands firm in a watchful, waiting stance.   We are not “seduced by despair, lostness or darkness.” (Nouwen)  As the Roman Catholic theologian Henri Nouwen wrote, “That is how we dare to say that God is a God of love even when we see hatred all around us.\\xa0 That is why we can claim that God is a God of life even when we see death and destruction and agony all around us.\\xa0 (throughout Advent) We say it together.\\xa0 We affirm it in one another.\\xa0 Waiting together, nurturing what has already begun, expecting its fulfillment.”  \\nAnd so Advent begins.  This is the season of our waiting, and our not waiting.  May God guide us in observing a Holy Advent seasons.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tIn terms of our evolution as humans, worry seems to have a particular helpful function:  If you hear a growl behind those trees, be worried!  It may be a tiger sneaking up on you.  Worried about making it through a long cold winter?  A good incentive to storing up supplies and stockpiling that food.  But for most of us, given our privilege of income, housing security, possibly the color of our skin, access to a paying job, most of us don’t have to worry about food and clothing too much.  But we still wake up in the middle of the night, anxious and overwhelmed.  What do you find that your worry about the most?  Your health? Is about people you love?  Someone you hate?  Will my money run out before I do?  Is it about a secret you have hidden?   Our worries tell us a lot about who we are and our assumptions about the world.  Our brain assumes if it is worrying, at least it is getting something done!\\n\\n\\tBut it never really helps to simply tell someone, or ourselves, “stop worrying.”   I suspect Jesus knew this.  Notice how he tells people to consider, to look carefully, at the wild lilies of the field, of which there are about 250 species in the Middle East.  Closely examine the birds of the air, like this raven here. Is this just about giving our brain something else to do?  Why did he pick something living, not an inanimate object, for us to consider.   He didn’t say consider this rock.  Nor, consider this person.  No….take a close, careful look at flowers and birds.  In other places, Jesus teaches his disciples about prayer, about silence, about acknowledging their own powerlessness and affirming God’s power.  But here, he says to look at flowers and birds.  How did he know that contemplating the forces of nature shifts things in our brain?\\n\\tA recent study by researchers at Stanford University seems to have proven Jesus’ observation.  In this study, subjects took a 90 minute walk out in a forested or grassy setting, and others walked through busy city streets.  One would expect that this might affect heart rate and general feeling of well being, from the quiet alone.  But researchers noticed something profound also happened in peoples brains when they walked in a natural setting: “Neural activity in a part of the prefrontal cortex decreased among participants who walked in nature versus those who walked in an urban environment.”  This is the part of the brain region most active during rumination, or repetitive thought focusing on negative emotions.  This worry activity apparently decreased when we are out walking in nature. ()\\n\\n \\tIn studies that have been replicated around the world, it appears that time spent in nature, considering the lilies of the field and the birds of the air, actually makes changes the activity in a region of our brain, we ruminate on ideas that bring up negative emotions - and makes us measurably calmer, happier and even more alert and smarter.  Perhaps it is in nature, out in the wild, that we begin to get a sense of what Jesus was talking about when he spoke of “God’s good pleasure.” It may be something else we are absorbing out in the wild, be it our own backyard, a city park, quiet time on a lake or up in the Boundary Waters.  Jesus put it this way:  “do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”   The Kingdom of God: the ancient Hebrew phrase describing the rule of God on earth, characterized by compassion, justice and peace.  Humans living out a life of mercy and loving community,\\n\\n\\tThere are other studies that have found that people act more cooperatively, not just in their self-interest, after simply viewing nature videos.  A study just out in the\\xa0Journal of Environmental Psychology, by psychologist\\xa0\\xa0and several other colleagues from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada tests the idea\\xa0that there’s a link between actually experiencing the natural world, and behaving in a sustainable way. “We hypothesized that participants exposed to nature will make more cooperative, and thus sustainable, choices,” they wrote.  And for those participants viewing nature videos, instead of photos of buildings, this was indeed what they found to be true.\\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/06/the-radical-political-implications-of-spending-time-outdoors/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.3528c537ad3 \\n\\n\\t“It is God’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom,” Jesus said to his closest followers. Jesus was picking up on the prophets’ call for a return to God’s reign, style of ruling, with equity for all. Jesus was not just talking about some interior moral kingdom in our hearts; and this is were we get distracted in our life together as Christians.  Paradoxically, he taught that “the Kingdom of God is within you;” an animating force already inside of us.  But he also described a world around us in which fairness and justice for everyone must rule.  And this world would come about not with violence, like overthrowing Rome’s military might.  Its power would come through non-violence and mutual compassion. \\n\\tWendell Berry’s poem, “The Peace of Wild Things” may give us a flavor of what Jesus was getting at:\\nTHE PEACE OF WILD THINGS (Wendell Berry)\\nWhen despair grows in me\\nand I wake in the middle of the night at the least sound\\nin fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,\\nI go and lie down where the wood drake\\nrests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.\\nI come into the peace of wild things\\nwho do not tax their lives with forethought\\nof grief. I come into the presence of still water.\\nAnd I feel above me the day-blind stars\\nwaiting for their light. For a time\\nI rest in the grace of the world, and am free.\\nTop of Form\\nBottom of Form\\n\\n\\n\\tOur poets, and now modern science, agree: we are made more calm, relaxed and cooperative by our time spent considering the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.  By our time spent simply carefully observing, enjoying, the natural world.  By absorbing this incredible reality of a web of connection between us and all that is, growing, dying, being reborn, all around us. Perhaps we are actually better able to imagine, welcome, embrace God’s reign among us as we spend time “considering” nature around us, the greenness, the fluffy clouds against blue sky, the sun sparkling on a lake, plump fruit and ripe vegetables.  God’s good pleasure: All gifts of deep summer in Minnesota that, when carefully considered, actually heal our brains and calm our worry;  God’s good pleasure - gifts that are now, for us.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tLet’s think this morning about the news….information about the new in the world beyond our front door.   How do you get your news? A newspaper thunks on your front doorstep each morning?  Television news?  Radio? A news stream that pops into your email each morning?  Checking an app on your smart phone?  We likely have some generational differences among us in how we get our news.  And some days we may not want to hear it at all!  Do you stay on one “channel,” one feed, or do you move around…do you hear different views, different kinds of analysis about what is happening out there?  \\n\\tFull disclosure: I’m a public radio gal, myself; I’m in my car a lot as I go to visit you in the hospital, your homes, a coffee shop or attend meetings.  Having left my familiar Washington Post when I moved here from northern VA, I now hear from the Sunday New York Times, savored through the week, daily NY Times news drop into my email, web following of our two Twin Cities papers, and random batches of the Economist passed on from one of you!  For insightful commentary about the confusing morass of world events, I often turn to the investigative journalist Nicholas Kristof.  I find him to be a steady, honest, clear-eyed companion as I try and figure out how to follow the Jesus Way of compassion and justice in this world.  Kristof seldom speaks theologically in his editorials, but he often addresses the practices of compassion and justice.  He brought me up short a few weeks ago with an editorial called “Overreacting to Terrorism.”  Actually, his  March 24editorial was less about the threat of terrorism and more what we are not actually hearing about:  the threat of carbon emissions transforming the world more quickly than we ever expected.  It was about climate change, and climate chaos, and our persistent inability to hear, pay attention to human’s negative impact on our environment.  This caught my attention:  “The basic problem is this:  the human brain evolved so that we systematically misjudge risks and how to respond to them.”  \\t\\n\\tKristof went on to claim that our “visceral fear of terrorism has repeatedly led us to adopt policies that are expensive and counterproductive.”  He noted that on the same day as the terrorist attack in Brussles, a paper was released by James E. Hansen (an eminent former NASA scientifist) and other climate experts, “arguing that carbon emissions are transforming our world far more quickly than expected, in ways that may inundate coast cities and cause storms more horrendous than any in modern history.  The response?  A yawn.”  Kristof’s point?  We are misjudging the risks.  We may be paying attention to, listening to, the wrong threat.   What do we listen to, actually, that forms our sense of place and responsibility in the world?\\t \\n\\tAs I listen to these two scripture texts this morning, I am struck first by how the religious leaders of Jesus time were misjudging the risks in terms of Jesus.  In the John passage, Jesus is deep in conversation with them in the Temple in Jerusuam.  The Jewish leaders want him to simply things.  “Tell us plainly, are you the Messiah?”  They are eager to reduce him to a title, which will allow them to nail down his program:  are you like one of those rabble-rousing rebels, the Maccabeans, who we celebrate on this Feast of the Dedication, the Feast of Lights and Chanukka?  Let us know, please, because we are wary of allowing threats to the populace, and the Romans are getting understandably nervous about the crow  you are drawing.  Come on Jesus, tell us if you are one of those terrorists for the Lord or not!  But Jesus doesn’t bite.  He won’t let them reduce him to a simplistic title.  “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify to me” he says to them.  It’s as if he is saying: you don’t get it because you don’t participate in this new Way; you don’t belong to my flock, to my sheep…that is….you aren’t following me.”  In Jewish history, corrupt and unjust Kings were refered to as “bad shepherds” who did not watch out for their flock.  The followers of Jesus the, his sheep, listen to and recognize his voice as that of the Good Shepherd.  They “hear” him and follow, and they experience transformed and abundant life in the present.  \\n\\tAnd of course, we are hearing about Earth Day, again, which circles me back to Kristoff’s challenge.  How might you and I be misjudging the true risks around us at this point in time?  And I wonder what is sinking in for us this year as we think about our land and air and oceans of this precious planet.  Bad news, Good news?   Earth Day, 2016, now 46 years after the first Earth Day established by Senator Gaylor Nelson of Wisconsin.  He happened to observe the appalling damage caused by a massive oil spill off the central Cailifornia coast in 1969.  He called for national “teach ins” that would educate the public about threats to the environment.  And people heard news that was hard to ignore.  Earth Day became a generator of public support of the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, Clean Air Act, Water Quality Improvement Act, Endangered Species Acts and others.  Public officials moving forward on behalf of the common good.  \\n\\tOn we approach Earth Day again this year, I’m also hearing the voice of Diane Butler Bass, American religion historian and researcher into what makes contemporary churches vital and growing.  She has an uncanny ability to track how our perception of God is shifting in the world:  from a distant God who looks down on us and whose connection with us is mediated by religious institutions, to a God who is experienced in the world around us.  Her most recent book Grounded: Finding God in the World  I hear her describing how our connection with God and our connection with this planet are woven together.  “God as integral to all creation; entwined with the sacred ecology of the universe.”    I’m deep into her chapter on “soil.”  She describes how “we are made from soil (God breathes life into the dust, in the Creation story, we are made from animated dirt)…we are placed in God’s garden and directed to care for the soil from which we come.”  She painstakenly describes the hughly degraded state and disappearance of our world’s topsoil, due to an inter-related maelstrom of deforestation, erosion, floodings and droughts.  Might we read this book together?  Might God be calling this congregation to a closer, more creative connection with the dirt upon which we sit as a church?  What would that look like?\\n\\tI hear the news of the day, and I hear so many voices calling for healing, for change, for transformation.  It’s overwhelming at times.  The disciple Peter heard two men from the Joppa church community tell him of the suffering of their sister in Christ, Tabitha.  “Come quick, we need you.  She is important to us; a creative woman, a noted seamstress, she ministers to the poor and widowed among us and is known for her good works.  We love her and need her; please come.”  Tabitha’s women friends surround Peter as he arrives, and weepingly tell of her work among them.   Peter clears the room, moves to her bedside and tells Tabitha to “get up.”  How on earth does Tabitha hear him?  She is dead.  How is she able to respond and get up off her bed?  She is…dead!   Just as the Jewish prophets Elijah and Elisha brought people back from the dead, and Jesus is described as raising Lazrus from his grave….now Peter does the same.   And somehow God reanimates her humanness.  The soil, the stuff of her body is enlivened again. \\n\\tDid these things really happen?  Are these stories poetic metaphor?   I tell you, I just don’t know.  But in encounter after encounter during his earthly ministry, Jesus invited people not so much to believe a certain doctrine but to simply “follow me” and to be changed in the process.  When asked where he dwelled, he would reply “come and see.”   But it was never a specific habitation; people were invited was simply into his presence, into a relationship with him.  And the resurrection appearances taught his followers that this ongoing relationship of compassion and clarity was still unfolding, as they joined together in equaltarian communities of mutual love, respect and care for the needs of the marginalized.   And they experienced the transformation of their hearts and they were on fire to share how their lives were transformed.  The Risen Jesus was there, in their ongoing encounter with him, if they listened with the ears of their hearts.  This “good shepherd” would continually challenge them to let go, and stop clinging to the places where the world insisted they would be secure, where they would be acclaimed, where they would be powerful. \\n\\tWhat are we hearing?  Nicholas Kristof says that there is “scientific consensus that (carbon) emissions on our watch are transforming our globe for 10,000 years to come.”  Diana Butler Bass describes how our soil comes “from a long process that includes the earth’s carbon cycle.” (p. 48).  This cycle took millions of years to create, “but now this (cycle) is dangerously out of balance” as more carbon moves out of our soil and into our atmosphere (p. 49).  She reminds me that restoration of our soil reserves connects issues dear to my heart:  the “local food movements, issues of food and health, and the relationship of food and justice.”   What are we hearing this morning?  How might such news animate and transform us, and possibly change a part of our world?  What do we hear the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ saying to us?  I’m hearing “get up and get at it.”  “Be that transformation you want to see.”  Amen.  \\n\\t\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIn Jesus time, it was nothing new to say that God forgives.  Within the Jewish tradition and Hebrew scriptures God was constantly re-building bridges between Godself and careless, rebellious, sinful humans.   But as Jesus  challenged and reformed his own religious tradition, he pushed people to also wrestle with forgiveness in human affairs.   Blind retaliation, judicial retribution…these were not enough.  Pray like this: “And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us.”  The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of  Luke each recorded this a bit differently.  Today we used Matthew’s version:  And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtor \\n\\nI once served a church as Interim Minister where there was considerable disagreement over how to say this part of the Lord’s Prayer.  Apparently there had been along history of saying “trespasses” as they prayed the Lord’s prayer together in worship.  But at some point the previous minister had chosen to change “trespasses” to “sins,” without consulting the worship committee or anyone else.  To me, this raised some important questions about the role and authority of the minister, and how minister and congregation work together to not just run the church, but to design and order the worship that binds them together.   For some this change was quite an affront and others did not seem to have a problem with it.   Apparently, no one had directly confronted the minister about it.  All this raised some important questions about how a congregation and a minister work collaboratively together:  How might they all give each other more honest and direct feedback in their ministry together?   And when there is a problem in our ministry together….like a trespass or a indebtedness or a sin….how do congregation and minister acknowledge it, make amends, forgive, and move on?  \\n\\nForgiveness has to do with how we co-exist with the past where mistakes have been made; how the past dwells in our memory and heart.   This part of the Lord’s Prayer deals with the messiness of life, or put theologically, our sinfulness. If we aren’t resorting simply to retaliation or retribution, how do we begin again?  The Russian writer Alexksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote about forgiveness after his suffering in Soviet labor camps:  “In this way we differ from all animals.  It is not our capacity to think that makes us different, but our capacity to repent, and to forgive.  Only humans can perform that most unnatural act, and by doing so only they can develop relationship s that transcend the relentless law of nature.”  (quoted in Augsberger, p. 10, Helping People Forgive).  \\n\\nWithout necessarily denigrating animal intelligence, I certainly can admit that forgiveness feels really unnatural.  It feels like I am letting an offender “off the hook,” like what they did didn’t matter.   Apparently, Jesus’ main disciple Peter thought it was unnatural too.  “How many times do we have to forgive someome who sins against us…maybe just seven times (which probably seemed pretty generous).  “No,” says Jesus, “77 times.”\\n\\t\\n\\tJesus taught that our sinfulness against God, our resistance to God leading us, puts us in debt to God, in a very real sense.  It is a debt that we just can’t pay back.  We all have to fall on God’s mercy. Some Biblical scholars maintain that “debts” may come closest to Jesus’ original words.  As Jesus’ original audience would hear “debt” and remember the stories of their ancestor’s release from debt-slavery in Egypt.  They would remember the teachings from Deuteronomy we just heard:  There was to be a rhythm of every seven years of release from debt.  Just like the rhythm of releasing your land from plantings by letting them lay fallow, debts should be forgiven and slaves were to be released.  The reminder was always this:  Pharoh’s Egypt was not just; the Israelites, the people of God are not to become another Egypt.  Could “forgive us our debts as we forgives our debtors” have to do with our part in the Kingdom of God, the Household of God?  Make sure there is enough for everyone in God’s House and not too much debt weighing people down? \\n\\n “Not seven times, but, I tell you, 77 times” replies Jesus.  And after giving this absurdly high number, Jesus proceeds to tell a story about literal financial debt. And it is a dire story of a harsh king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves.  After much pleading, one heavily in-debt slave is finally forgiven his debt (the equivalent of about $25 million) by the relenting king.  But then this slave has the audacity to turn around and imprison a fellow slave who owes him a small amount of money (the equivalent of about $50).  His fellow slaves are understandably distressed by this double-standard and inform the king.  Infuriated, the king orders the slave tortured until he presents the money he is concealing and repays his entire debt.  The story ends rather ominously with Jesus suggesting that God will do this to us if we do not forgive our brothers and sisters from our hearts.  Whoa. \\n\\t\\n\\tA few months ago, I spoke about how several years ago, a church member pressed upon me a copy a novel called The Shack, by William P. Young.  While not particularly great fiction, I mention it again because of how it wrestles with forgiveness.  It is an unsettling yet compelling story of a man who, I’m not sure how else to describe this, “meets God.”  His life is miserable, as he is trying to cope with the kidnapping and murder of his young daughter.  Several years after the girl’s disappearance, the distraught and grieving father receives an anonymous summons to travel to an abandoned wilderness cabin related to his daughter’s abduction.  Cautious and curious, there he has an astounding encounter with…..well, as odd as this may sound…..the three persons of the Holy Trinity.  Whether this is in a dream or in an altered state or happens in real time, the reader doesn’t quite know.  But God in three persons shows up as an older woman called Papa, a youngish male carpenter called Jesus and a strangely vibrant, multi-colored and somewhat transparent female apparition who is the Spirit.  They talk with the bereaved father, they eat meals together, they sing, they walk around, they talk and eat some more.  Much of their discussion is about forgiveness, which, as you may well imagine, does not sit well with this overwhelmed parent who would happily kill the man who murdered his daughter.  At one point the Jesus figure says to the angry father:  “Forgiveness is not about forgetting.  It is about letting go of another persons’ throat.”  I was struck by this image.  There have certainly been times when I have had both of my hands around someone’s’ throat, even if it is only in my imagination.  When this happens to us, both hands are busy with hanging on, and not available for much else.  How willing are we to let-go, and in the releasing, opens up some space with us?  This space seems inextricably connected, according to Jesus, with our ability to engage in God’s forgiveness of us.  \\t  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe church has often treated forgiveness too casually.   The battered spouse encouraged to forgive her husband without finding her help and safe haven.  Little careful analysis about how a reconciliation process might proceed after injury, on individual and communal levels.  Proclaiming one can “forgive and forget” as though we might actually get a lobotomy and the memory disappears.  Deep, and especially early, wounding needs careful guidance, trained counselors, to accompany us through the terrain of healing.  \\n\\t\\n\\tHere is the challenge of Jesus’ vision: if I have a falling out with my fellow human, can I come to see that person as worthful, in spite of the wrongdoing?  If not, I have not cleaned up my part of it.  I am going to have trouble connecting with God. Not because God rejects me; I’m not in much of a receiving mode.  My own unforgiving attitude blocks the channel of forgiveness.  My hands are still around that person’s throat.  My hands (and heart) are not open and available to join with God’s, nor are they really available to help anyone else.   \\n\\t\\n\\tForgiveness not only frees our hands up, it helps us recover our energies and our personal power, our integrity.   “Pray like this,” said Jesus:  “Forgive us our debts, our trespasses, our sins, as we forgive our debtors, those who trespass, sin against us.”  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tOur scripture readings are awash with references to flowing water this morning.  Given that we have been in the “frozen zone” of an icey winter for so long, I find this imagery encouraging.  By early spring, most of us are eager for movement, some flow.…be it the rush of snow melt and unlocked streams,  our bodies finally outdoors breathing in the fresh air, spring rains coaxing out the slow seep of green buds.   Gently moving water is actually our first sensual experience, as we each floated for months in our biological mother’s amniotic fluid...there in the darkness, our own water-filled body suspended yet held firm.  We each come from a similar place, A mysterious primal abode, filled with sounds of another human heartbeat and dim noises from a world beyond that we had yet to discover.   A commonality we share with each person on the planet; something to ponder in the midst of human diversity, differences and conflict. We come from water, our ancestors crawling up out of the sea to dry land.  We grow in water, we are mostly water.  No wonder this elemental substance has become water such a powerful metaphor in religions and cultures around our water-covered world.   \\n\\t\\n\\tNo where is water a more powerful metaphor than in desert cultures, where the presence of water means life and its absence can spell suffering and death.  Both Jews and Samaritans would know this wilderness story of God providing water for the thirsty Israelites in the wilderness.  Both groups shared the same reverence for the first 5 books of the Bible, the Torah.  But unlike the Jews in the 1st century of the common era, the Samaritans did not accept the writings of the Prophets. They believed Mt. Gerizim was the place for worship of God, not the temple mount in Jerusalem.  Jews considered Samaritans to be impure because they married outside their faith and Samaritans considered the Jews to be unworthy participants in the covenant; these were arguments that went back by centuries and they mistrusted and distained each other.  At this point in John’s narrative Jesus has been teaching and healing in Judea in the south.  And for some reason, on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus makes the risky decision to get there by traveling straight north, passing right through Samaria.  \\n\\nWe have this account of a rather unusual conversation between Jesus and a woman he meets while traveling through the Samaritan territory.  It is the longest recorded conversation between Jesus and anyone in all 4 gospels.  That is in itself curious because Jesus is breaking a lot of rules in talking in even being near this woman.  Jews and Samaritans do not mix and mingle like this.  Drinking from a cup offered by an impure Samaritan will make you ritually unclean and you can’t participate in Temple worship in Jerusalem.  Plus, rabbis are not allowed to talk with women in public, as this also will make you ritually unclean.   So, there he sits by this well, tired and hot from traveling.  We see and feel his humanness; he is thirty and has no way to retrieve water from the well.  It’s high noon and Jesus disciples have gone off to try and find some food.  A woman appears with a water jar.  \\n\\nBiblical commentators have speculated endlessly about why this unnamed woman hasn’t drawn her daily water in the cool of the morning or waited for the evening.  Ah, she must be shunned by the other women water-drawers; she is probably sexually immoral.  Unfortunately, this assumption appears to have been the default mode for much of traditional masculine commentary on women in scripture.  Same thing happens to Mary Magdalene but that is another story and another sermon series.  This unnamed woman may be ostracized from her community in some way. Some surmise she is a prostitute, but the text does not say this.  She admits to having a number of husbands, but we don’t really know why this is. As a first century woman, you could be divorced at the drop of a hat.  Has she been widowed numerous times?  We remember that in ancient cultures, if your husband dies you can easily get passed between your husband’s brothers in the effort to produce a male heir.   \\n\\nJesus’ talks with her at length and breaks the rules in his culture.  These were rules that perpetuated the marginalization, the poverty and demeaning of women.  Implications for us in this conversation?  Here is another challenge in following Jesus:  If we attend to this story, we can’t help but wonder: Who is marginalized among us, like the Samaritans among the Jews?  Or more problematically:  What cultural rules of marginalization are you and I being called to break in Jesus name?  Who are we supposed to avoid or ignore, according to our predominate culture?  \\n\\nBRING IN COVID 19 HERE…..\\nAs a congregation, we may have become an “Open and Affirming” congregation, welcoming of the LGBT community.  Easy perhaps to welcome same gender couples with children who make there way to us; what would it be like for us to actively invite transgendered individuals?  What does it mean for us to offer radical hospitality and compassion to the truly marginalized? Gender fluid or transgendered people? For starters, who might we each have a conversation with this week who seems really  different from me?\\n\\nBack to the interaction at the well.  Jesus asks the woman for some water; she asks why he is asking her, a Samaritan, for a drink.  Jesus replies that if she knew who he was, she would be asking for living water.  “Living water” here takes on a double meaning; both fresh, moving water and now something else which isn’t quite clear.  The woman first focuses on the literal physical impossibilitiy of Jesus retrieving water without a bucket, and then this idea of a “water” that quenches all thirst.  I hear the resounding echo of every time someone tells me that they can’t believe in the Bible because of all the seemingly impossible things they can’t take literally.  We read last week of how the Pharisee Nicodemus’ conversation with Jesus:  the Jewish leader focused on the physical impossibility of being born again from your mother’s womb.  Nicodemus and this unnamed woman both get snagged on the assumption that literalism is the only way to understand the spiritual journey.  In both conversations, Jesus is pushing people to “think outside the box.”  Following this Jesus is not just about the correct comprehension or being a nicer or better person, like a car-jack that boosts you up a few notches.  Jesus wanted people to know that following him is going to involve a transformation of our inner selves, our inner spirit.  Something about Jesus, his living presence, can come into us and grows and enlarges.  It will grow our own love and compassion, transforming assumptions, perceptions and self-awareness.  This is not easy to comprehend. Here, Jesus describes himself as both giving and being the living water.  Jesus is claiming that he himself manifests, incarnates, all the blessings in their tradition which relate to water:  miraculous outdoor springs that bust out of rocks and save the people from death; inner springs that are the movement of God in one’s personal depths, an ever-renewed and mysterious upwelling of full life within us.  Who IS this man to say these presumptuous things? \\n\\t\\n\\tIt turns out that you can still go visit the called “Jacob’s well” today, in the land south of Jerusalem.  Water still fills that well, not from a spring but from an actual underground river that has run for centuries deep in the earth.  Jesus sat by this well that drew from a rushing underground river; talk about living water!  God’s power is that accessible to you, Jesus explained to the woman, “I am the living water.”  This is the deep mystery the apostle Paul would later try and describe in one of his letters: “God’s love has been poured into our hearts.”  “God’s love has been poured into our hearts thru the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.”  I find that these Biblical metaphors often elude my powers of deductive reasoning.  I have to almost go “side-ways” into my brain with some tactile experiencing.  And when it comes to water metaphors, one access point may be as close as our indoor plumbing.   Later today, when you turn on your tap at home, let the water flow over your hands for a minute.  Cup your hands and let the water fill and overflow them.  Close your eyes and imagine the Creator of the Universe pouring love and compassion and insight and strength into your heart.   Turn off the water, dry your hands.  Picture again what you just experienced.  Remind yourself of overflowing water filling your hands through the rest of the day.  Say to yourself: “I am one who has love poured into me through the Holy Spirit.”  As one who is truly seen with compassion and loved by God, just the woman at the well was seen, encouraged and accepted by Jesus.\\nHow can I live in this moment, in this situation, as one who so filled?  How is this living water over-flowing out of me to others?  \\n\\t\\n\\t “There is a man here who has told me everything I have ever done!” the woman said breathlessly, after she had run back into town.  “And he did not judge me, but listened to me and told me he is living water!  Could this possibly be the Messiah?”  Amazingly, on her word, in a world where a woman’s witness means nothing, the townspeople came hurrying to meet Jesus.  Samaritans, all, crowding around him, hearing and believing, inviting him stay with them.\\n\\tGod’s living water of abundant life poured into our hearts and overflowing to the point where we just have to talk about it.  As our thirst is quenched, we naturally pour out to others.  May we each watch for those moments this week where our overflowing hearts can share this spiritual, living water.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEDICTION\\n\\nGo into this week\\n\\nwith your lives overflowing with the love of God,\\n\\nyour hearts saturated with the peace of Jesus Christ,\\n\\nyour whole being\\xa0filled with the power of the Holy \\n\\nSpirit.

       " '\\tBy this point, most of us have either seen or heard about the recent video clip in which an Oklahoma tornedo survivor tells Wolf Blitzer she is an atheist.   An editorial by Alexandra Petri’s in yesterday’s Washington Post (May 25, 2013) describes the CNN anchor questioning a mother with in arms toddler about their narrow escape from last week’s devastating tornado.  “I guess you got to thank the Lord, right?” the newsman inquired.  No answer forthcoming from the woman; Blitzer presses on: “Do you thank the Lord?  For that split-second decision?”  The woman finally replies:  “I’m actually an atheist.”   What I found interesting is that Alexandra Petri goes on to remind us that only about 2% or Americans actually describe themselves as atheists.  Encountering a self-described atheist in American’s heartland is apparently so unusual that Glenn Beck claimed the interview was some kind of fake.   Petri mused that thanking the Lord for such events is a natural assumption for around 80% of Americans, and that we presume everyone thinks the same way.  “Hold on a minute,” I thought to myself.  I would not place myself among the 2% of atheists, but maybe we have something in common here!  I don’t believe that God saved certain people from that tornado and did not save others.  For me, this is not God’s job description: specifically guiding a split-second decision that allows for safety for some, and letting others be crushed by crumbling walls or killed by flying debris.   \\n\\tI imagine we have a variety of perspectives in this congregation on just what God was up to in the tornedo, and in this world of ours in general.  Has God created our world but now left its workings to us?  As Anthony Robinson, UCC minister and author, asks in his book What’s Theology Got to Do with It: Convictions, Vitality and the Church:  “Is God simply a concept to be discussed?  …is our life a seminar about God, rather than a relationship to be confessed or a community where God’s transformative presence is changing lives?” (p. 68-69).  Last week we shared again the wild story of Pentecost, where Jesus’ disciples were suddenly filled with the power of the Holy Spirit sent by God.  After Pentecost, these men and women start to courageously speak out about being filled with the Holy Spirit and a profound sense of new life. Courageously they step forward, testifying about their personal, life-changing experiences of God, Jesus and the indwelling of God’s renewing power.   Did the God of the first century act differently than the God of the 21st?  Are there only two options now: there is no God who interacts with us or God is in control of everything?  From dramatic natural disaster rescues to helping us find parking places?   Neither of these seem like good options to me.\\n\\tAnthony Robinson would say that the age-old doctrine of the Trinity is the place to wrestle with these questions.  He claims that this “three persons of God in one” idea guards against our turning God into some kind of personalized comfort zone.   The Trinity “holds different truths in tension” (p. 64) and keeps pushing us to consider how we might know God in different ways and different forms.  \\n\\t It took the official Christian church about 300 years to formulate this symbolic language about both the Person and the actions of God, and it was stimulated by considerable controversy about Jesus himself.  Who was he?  Divine in some way or all human?  Who is Jesus now as Risen Messiah, the Risen Christ, in our midst? This ancient Trinitarian wording, “Father, Son and Holy Ghost” became the shorthand metaphorical language used in Christian baptism, later in confirmation when young people affirm the baptismal vows made on their behalf when they were infants. Through the centuries there have been numerous controversies, heresies have been declared and denounced, and spilled blood over the doctrine of the Trinity.  In the early 17 and 18th centuries, debate over the Trinity, particularly the nature of Jesus, divided many of our United Church of Christ forebearers, in New England Congregational churches.\\n\\tThere are many times I want to distance myself from the mediocrity, the hypocrisy and shabbiness of much institutional religion.  But as much as I love to feel God’s immense and intimate presence out in the grandeur of nature, through gazing at art, or privately listening to music, I know I need to be in, and to experience God’s presence, within community.  Coming to Sunday worship on a regular basis reminds me that I don’t come to God alone.  It’s not just what we personally read or hear in worship, it is the people.  In weekly worship we bump into people who are different from us, other humans, who like me, can tend to be hurtful but also helpful, to be forgiving and to nurse grudges.  We sit next to people who can support wars and yet also hunger for peace.  We share coffee with people who may make mistakes with their children but also raise the next generation with generosity and grace.  Coming to worship, week after week, mixing with all these different people in community together– it’s so communal, relational, so messy at times!  And I believe this is at the heart of what God is all about.  God is all about relationship.  The doctrine of the Trinity has helped me understand and enter this mystery like nothing else.\\n\\tOne of our United Church of Christ treasurer is church historian and author, Barbara Brown Zigmund.  She explains that this metaphor of God as creator, redeemer and sustainer, describes God as “one God existing in community.”  The Trinity speaks of how “God embodies the very nature of reality as relational and communal” (Barbara Brown Zigmund, Christian Century, 4/15/87).  I hear that same relational and communal aspect of God in today’s reading from Book of Proverbs:  Wisdom, there with God at the beginning of time?  Wisdom, as aspect of God?  Partner with God?  There may be more “we-ness” to God than we think.  “Let us create humans in our image,” God speaks in Genesis, “male and female let us create them.”  BBZ’s point is that we can both understand God better, and who we are as human beings, when we recognize “the relational nature of God.”  Another way of saying this, is “we are all connected…and God is a part of that precious connectedness.”  \\n\\tThings get even livelier in my mind when I think of both a masculine and feminine aspect within the Trinity itself.  Might this Lady Wisdom be an inter-connecting, annimating force between these different aspects of God?  The idea of God existing as a 3-in-1 relationship suggests to me a dynamic, fertile and even dare-I-say juiciness within Godself.  Does this sound too racey?  I think it makes God infinitely more interesting, and relatable to me as a living human.  BBZ suggests that “to believe in a triune God is to suggest that there is an inner relationship within Godself which spills over into the Christian life.” I love this image. “There is an inner relationship within God’s self which spills over into” our lives.  We don’t have to constantly rev ourselves up, produce all this life-giving, inspiring, relational energy on our own.  It’s already spilling over onto us from the 3-in-1 God!  \\nOne 8th century theologian, John of Damascus, put it this way:  “there is an exchange of energy between the persons of the Trinity by virtue of their eternal love.”  The Persons of the Holy Trinity metaphorically hanging around loving each, grooving on each other, and all this interconnectedness and intimacy and affection overflows onto us!   Hold that image in your minds eye the next time you look at one of your children, your grandchildren.  Relational overflow!  The next time you stare up into a tree or at the stars.  Vibrating connections, back and forth.  The next time you look at your face in a mirror.  Not just energy, but the affection of God-in-three-persons spills over into everything.  As Proverbs describes God and Wisdom constantly “rejoicing in God’s inhabited world and delighting in the human race.”  And because this delight overflows onto us, we too can be creative and wise, just like God our Father/Mother who is the wise creator. We too can be helpers and peaceworkers in this world, just like God in Jesus our brother.  We too can inspire and provide companionship to others, just like God in the Holy Spirit which has been sent to us.\\n\\tSo when I think of the Trinity these days, I don’t see some old dusty, outdated and irrelevant church doctrine.  I get an image of powerful, even wild and unpredictable, love energy crackling between the synapses of God.  Snapping, sizzling, vibrating  connections between God the Father/Mother our Creator, God the Son, God the Spirit.  God existing as community; us coming together as religious community so we can experience this vibrating God more intimately.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " \"SUMMER IN THE SOUL\\n\\n\\tWow, what a wild story.  Jesus fed over 5000 people with just five loaves of bread and two fish?  That’s crazy!  I think we need to use our Summer Brain to think about this for a minute….ask Chris to put us in the mood (plays “Summertime”).  \\t\\nSummertime, and the livin' is easy\\nFish are jumpin' and the cotton is high\\nOh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'\\nSo hush little baby, Don't you cry\\nGeorge Gershwin wrote that song for a musical show called “Porgy and Bess.”  \\nWe are going to need to use our imagination and kind of squint our eyes a bit to see this scene….kind of like in the summer sun.   \\n\\n\\tNow this is a story that is easy to imagine…but it is hard to believe.  Here’s the background: Jesus has just heard that his friend John the Baptist has been killed by King Herod.  It’s a pretty gross story how that happened:  John the Baptist who baptized Jesus and was calling people to change their ways and live more honest lives….well he had said the same thing to King Herod, who worked for the Romans keeping everything calm and cool in Jerusualem, and he made a lot of money doing it.  King Herod did not like the implication that he wasn’t being honest, so he had John killed….in fact, during his birthday feast, he had his people bring John the Baptist’s head on a platter!  Pretty shocking.  Jesus was probably sad, mad and maybe scared for himself.  He goes off into the wilderness to be by himself.  But the crowds heard of where he had went and followed him.   Lots of people, pressing in on him, sick and lonely and hungry people.  He had compassion on them and starting healing many of them. \\n\\tPicture this huge crowd, 5000 men and probably twice that many women and children. Evening comes and the disciples realize that Jesus better wrap it up so everyone can return to the villages and buy food.   And what does Jesus do?  He turns to the disciples and says:  “The people don’t have to leave; you give them something to eat.”  And what do the disciples say?  “Uh, Jesus…we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.”   “Bring them here to me,” says Jesus.Jesus has been busy healing people all day and the sun starts to go down.  “Jesus,” his friends ask him, shouldn’t we send people into the town so they can buy food for  themselves?”  And Jesus says to them:  No, you give them something to eat.”  Uh, we just have alittle bit: 5 loaves of bread and a few fish!  That’s okay, bring them to me.  Jesus blesses them and breaks them into pieces, and before you know it all the people there get fed.  Over 5000 of them!  And there are 12 baskets of leftovers when everyone is finished!  \\n\\tWhen I go outside in summer I feel the thick, humid air.  I can’t see the air, but I know it is full of moisture.  I daydream about this alittle, and think about how the air is also thick with God and God’s actions, even though I can’t see them.  It’s mysterious and interesting to me at the same time.  I wonder about how God can use the little bit that I have, that you have, to make a difference in the world.  I imagine that God really wants all people to have enough food.  Wants us to all eat together sharing and in peace.  \\n\\tJesus said to his friends, YOU give them something to eat.  But I just have a little energy, just a little money, not very much talent, just one bottle of detergent to bring in.  Some people say maybe the real miracle that day was that when the disciples started sharing their food, everyone else took out there little bit of food and shared it with everyone and suddenly there was enough.   More than enough.  Summertime….time to slow our brains down and imagine a world where there is not just enough, \\n\\tbut overflowing abundance.  \\n\\tThe air thick with God. \\n\\tWhere the little we bring makes a difference as we add it all together.  \\n\\tFood for a picnic potluck.  Food for a hungry world.  \\n\\tOur summer brains can imagine that world.  Where the fish are jumpin’ and the cotton is high.  Where the livin’ is easy for all people.\\n\\nChris plays “Summertime” again.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tWhile the rest of the world makes New Years Resolutions and vacuums up pine needles, the 12 days of Christmas bring the church some puzzling stories.  Last week it was the tale of a precocious and annoyingly adolescent Jesus, ditching his parents and hanging out with the scholars and scribes in the Jerusalem.  This week, Jesus is somehow a baby again, and the magi, the three kings, are finally showing up at the manger.  None of this seems very orderly, and its certainly not chronological…which  might give us a hint about how different the Gospel writer’s priorities were from our own linear and perhaps narrow way of approaching truth.  So, back to the manger we go on Epiphany Sunday; the early church’s first mash-up date for the celebration of Jesus’ birth, Three Kings arrival and his adult baptism.  Epiphany – for “sudden manifestation,” or “revealing” of the Light of the new Messiah to the wider world.  \\n\\tThe author of Matthew, is not one of Jesus’ disciples, but is a leader in an early Christian community of Jewish Christians and non-Jewish Christians decades after Jesus’ death and resurrection.  Like many early Christian communities, they were trying to figure out what it means to follow the Jesus way at the end of the first century CE:  Under continued Roman occupation/oppression; Jerusalem and the Temple had been sacked again, and now lots of in-family in-fighting between Jews and Christians about newcomers being added to the fold who do not follow Jewish law nor understand the teachings of the Torah.   But why is the author of Matthew the only NT writer who offers up this fantastical tale of stargazing, foreign priests from the non-Jewish region of Persia, around modern day Iraq, coming to the manger with some very odd baby gifts?  These unlikely outsiders to the Bethlehm scene somehow follow an astronomical event (a moving star? stars don’t move; a comet, supernova, a planetary conjunction?) with portends profound astrological meaning (which somehow all the stargazers of Jersualem had missed?).  \\n\\tLike bucket of cold water tossed on this tender manger scene, this story awakens us  to the harsh political realities of the day: King Herod, the Jewish governor of the region had long been co-opted and rewarded by the Romans for his conniving power-grabs, paranoia and murderous cruelty to family members and fellow Jews alike.  The magi ask Herod about a newborn King of the Jews, a term used for the coming Messiah who would bring God’s rule of justice, mercy and peace on earth.  But what are Zoroastrian priests doing inquiring about a Jewish Messiah?  Herod is clearly no fan of competition from outsiders, neither these weirdly dressed foreign visitors who seem to know so much, or a little kid who may be destined to threaten Herod’s power.  \\n\\tThe Magi finally arrive at the manger, bringing gifts that are better suited for anointing a dead body than for a baby shower.  The Gospel writer is already laying hints of what is ahead as this unlikely Messiah confronts the powers of religious authorities, wealth and political corruption.  The Magi depart, as mysteriously as they appeared, and a startled Joseph is warned in a dream of Herods malicious intent.  Joseph will flee with his family to Egypt, narrowly escaping Herod’s pre-emptive slaughter of baby Jewish boys in the region.  After the revelry and sweet delight of Christmas, this Gospel story faces us with a reality which sounds all too contemporary: refuges fleeing typranical and violent governments, desperately looking for safety and solace.  \\n\\tAs I study this ancient story again, I wonder at the fear and the pride that may have driven Herod’s behavior.  His duty was to protect and prosper those under his governance, while also keeping Rome pleased and at bay.   I have found myself thinking about how we protect the well-being of our own realm of this community and this nation.  I think of the powerlessness we often feel as we pay attention to the world events swirling around us.  Like many of you this fall and early winter, I have been following the news of migrating refugees and the various attempts to deal with the largest population displacement, 60 million people displaced and on the move, since the end of World War II.   Complicating this heart-breaking reality has been our own nations’ struggle around rising gun violence and the rising danger of international terrorism and the force known as ISIS.  How does a Christian consider these complicated threats to community well-being?  What are the values and guiding beliefs that bring us hope in our own church community and in our nation in these unsettling times? As I have read various news commentaries on our nation’s past and present struggles around immigration, I couldn’t help but think of King Herod and his discomfort with those pesky Magi, those wisemen who disrupted the comfort of his court scene with unnerving questions.  We too struggle with the fear of disruption and forced change.  Our nation, with its proclaimed welcome of those in need to our shores, has often resisted the outsider. Our Puritan forefathers and foremothers were some of the worst:  Quakers, Anglicans, Baptists all were persecuted in the colonies, not to mention the native inhabitants of the new land.  Those of African descent, the Irish, the Catholics, all vilified and demonized, even from pulpits of the day.  \\n\\tBut we also lose a sense of our own history, if we see ourselves as only turning away the newcomer.  More recent leaders have reminded us, from both sides of the political aisle, that “immigrants are assets to be welcomed through assimilation and citizenship.”  This is who we are in this nation, and data shows that our economy has been bolstered because of it.  But even as lowering the barriers can make us a better nation, it also brings change.  And we grow fearful of those risks and allow others to stoke that fear in us:  we court ideas of more effective crimilization of immigrants among us, registerating, deporting. \\n\\t During Epiphany in the Christian church, we are invited deeper into the mysteries of the showing-forth of Jesus, his teachings and his power.  “Arise, shine;” wrote the Hebrew prophet Isaiah to the people Israel, “arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.”  This is also the call of the Christian community, to be this light in a world of darkness and fear.  There will be several opportunities this month to engage some of these complicated social well-being issues together:  a book study group and respectful conversation on gun violence.  An exploratory meeting to see if we have the resources and the willingness to sponsor an immigrant family through our congregation.   How might you each participate in exploring these possibilities?  How might this church become a place where difficult issues of communal well-being are discussed with respect and honesty?  A light in the darkness of polarized controvery that prevails in our media and even around our dinnertables.\\n\\tFor the Gospel writer Matthew, Jesus’ birth is so miraculous, that even the stars in the sky respond and lead mysterious outsiders to the child’s birthplace. Whether this encounter between the Holy Family and the manger late-comers literally happened in this way, we will never know.  But this tale of the wiremen, the magi from the East, takes the Jesus’ birth narratives in an unexpected direction.  Matthew is reminding his late first-century Jewish Christian congregation that Jesus had an early relationship with non-Jews.  Matthew’s congregation was reluctant to open its doors to non-Jewish Christians, to this Gentile world that didn’t know and accept their customs, their scriptures, and their rituals.  \\n\\tOn this 12th Day of Christmas, where are we reluctant to open our doors, our hearts, our minds?  This Epiphany, we are once again called to envision how we “share the light” of Jesus Christ in this time in history.  Amen.    \\n\\t \\n\\n\\n\\nDear Anthony,\\nYour question reflects a pattern of dualistic thinking that has persisted is Christianity since the fourth century. You assume that humanity and divinity are two distinct and different categories, mutually independent and incapable of being brought together without the invasion of one by the other. When Christians formulated the doctrine of the Incarnation, they were articulating this dualistic thinking. The result is that they portrayed Jesus as the invasion of the human by the divine. Jesus was thus portrayed as God disguised as a human being. In traditional Christian thinking Jesus was to God something like what Clark Kent was to Superman.\\nIf, however, we look at life itself as holy, as the unfolding of the divine in time and space, then the duality between the human and divine disappears. I think of the divine as the depth dimension of the human. The way into divinity is to be deeply and fully human. This was what enabled people to experience the divine in Jesus. It was in the fullness of his humanity through which the meaning of the divine was revealed because he lived out his humanity fully.\\nSo in my mind and in my experience there are not two realms, but one, and the way into divinity is through the doorway of the human. In my current series entitled “Charting a New Reformation” I will be exploring the issue of God in much greater detail.\\nSpong \\n\\n article on immigration impact on USA The Immigration Dividend By\\xa0TED WIDMEROCT. 6, 2015\\n\\n\\nMoments of Grace in a Grim Year- NYT article – saved as PDF\\n\\n\\nAnger in American History – NYT article – saved as PDF\\n\\n\\n\\nBernie Sanders Gets Immigration Policy Right\\nBy\\xa0NOV. 26, 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/26/opinion/bernie-sanders-gets-immigration-policy-right.html\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAs otherworldly and strange as they sound, these texts were written with people like us in mind.  They are usually crafted in times of political upheaval and societal fear.  Filled with visions of cosmic turmoil and earthly destruction, they mirror our worst imaginings. Writings like this also expose “the inadequacy of present structures to deal constructively with human life.”  Human institutions fail as the consequences of social and personal sin boil over and people suffer.  Yes, we have failed to end systemic racism in our nation and to reform our criminal justice system, we have failed to limit gun violence or truly address the causes of the current brand of terrorism that spills out of the Middle East turmoil.  But the writers of these texts want us to know a wider perspective:  Yes, “The threat of turmoil and destruction to come is real.” But also real is God’s “persistent working” behind the scenes to bring God’s domain of righteousness and justice on earth.  (Ibid.)   There is another reality at work among us.  \\nI suppose we can’t be blamed for wanting to avoid these parts of the Bible and to move on to the tender Birth narratives.  These kind of Biblical writings have certainly been misunderstood and misappropriated through the centuries. These writings give me the creeps, at some level. I watch people turn these ancient texts into modern day headlines and frankly they give Christianity a bad press.  One option is to dismiss apocalyptic talk as the domain of misguided Bible literalists.  But I have noticed that catastrophic thinking runs deep in human beings.  Who among us hasn’t reacted to yet another act of bigotry, hatred or a heinous injustice by wondering out loud if the human race even deserves to see the next decade? Is God really transforming and healing the world, we ask, feeling understandably hopeless and even cynical at times.  One has to wonder about God’s sense of timing or involvement at all. How very strange then, to hear these Advent readings that seem to suggest: if all hell is breaking loose, well, your redemption, your communal healing and hope, draws near!\\n\\tThe Jewish prophet Jeremiah lived and wrote some six centuries before the birth of Jesus, yet his world was in upheaval not unlike our own world. During Jeremiah’s lifetime there were tumultuous shifts of power in the ancient Middle East, with the breakup of the Assyrian empire and the rise of Babylonian power.  The political and religious elite of Israel was often greedy and corrupt, making unwise alliances, and Jeremiah spoke the truth as he saw it.  In today’s text, Jeremiah speaks the truth to power by claiming that God will make good on the promise to establish the line of King David again forever, even though Babylon will invade and carry off many of them in chains.  Jeremiah does not claim that all will turn out all right, but proclaims that a “righteous branch” will eventually spring forth and lead the people in justice and righteousness. \\n\\tThe gospel writer Luke is in no better situation.  Writing some 50 years after Jesus death and resurrection, Luke’s community is grappling with the sacking and destruction of their beloved city Jerusalem, in a squashed rebellion against the Roman Empire.  The Temple is defiled and destroyed, thus crushing the hopes of the many who understood the uprising to be God’s doing.  The Christians of Luke’s community had refused to take up arms in the city’s defense, and were now experiencing rejection and even persecution by their relatives and their neighborhoods.  \\nLuke records Jesus prophesying about this mayhem and destruction, giving hope and assurance to the Lucan church which is suffering in the present. In particular, the question at hand is when the promised return of Jesus and consummation of history will occur.  Jesus speaks these words on his way to his final confrontation with authorities in Jerusalem.  He points to a fig tree, apparently the last tree to blossom in the Palestinian springtime.  In the immanent Kingdom of God, says Jesus, the tables will be turned on the oppressive and unjust structures of the world.  Hold on to the vision of renewal, even when all seems lost!\\n\\tAbout a year and a half after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, my husband Chris and I traveled to that still unrecovered region with a truckload of donated used musical instruments.  We delivered the many horns, guitars and drums to a New Orleans school that had been flooded.  Then, we headed further east along the Gulf coast and we joined a UCC minister friend and her youth group from MA for a week of rebuilding houses in Biloxi, MS.  I spent most of those days covered in chalky dry-wall Spackle or helping Chris cook for the some 20 volunteers.  I marveled at how little we seemed to accomplish in this coastal fishing community where homes and livelihood were recovering slowly from Katrina’s devastating storm surge.   It seemed like one more story of “too little, too late,” in a place that local government and our wider country had already forgotten.\\n\\t “God, where were you in all this?” I would ask in my prayers as I fell exhausted into bed.  One evening, tired and discouraged, our group talked with staff members of Back Bay Mission, the UCC supported relief agency that was sponsoring us as volunteers.  One of the staff started playing the piano and teaching us a contemporary spiritual.  Pastor Don explained that he wanted us to sing this song at a preaching festival down at the huge Tabernacle Baptist Church later that week.  Our group was dubious about our Anglo ability to compete in any kind of face-off with larger, spirited African American choirs.  But Chris took over the keyboard and we dutifully worked on our song.  And as we practiced, I realized the lyrics were slowly pushing me off a theological edge:\\n\\tHe’s an on-time God, yes He is.  He’s an on-time God, yes He is.\\n\\tHe may not come when you want Him, but He’ll be there right on time.  He’s an on-time God, yes He is\\n\\tWhen Chris led our small group in offering this anthem in the packed Tabernacle Baptist a few nights later, our voices sounded meek and hesitant.  Suddenly the full-tilt house band swung in behind us on the second stanza, and the three visiting choirs and the whole congregation were on their feet, singing and clapping.  Wow, our little white group was starting to sound great!  To our amazement, everyone knew the song by heart and they joined in with exuberant joy, belting out these paradoxical words.  God may not come when you want him, but he’ll be there right on time. Many of these people had lost their homes, their businesses, even family members in Katrina’s storm surge Their beautiful sanctuary had been flooded with 9 feet of filthy storm water and debris.   . Neighbors and friends had been relocated far away. And here they were, in spite of natural disaster compounded by the failure of human institutions, corrupt local government, the disappearance of protective tidal marshes, years of racism and regional poverty, our own federal government’s blundered recovery efforts, here they were in spite of all this chaos singing about God’s faithful timing!  \\n\\t “The days will surely come, says the LORD,” wrote Jeremiah, “when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.” (33:14) The promise is about righteousness and justice ruling the earth. Redistribution of wealth and power, love of enemies, servant leadership, those marginalized by poverty, gender and race newly included.  Not just some change in management, but God’s righteousness and justice ruling the earth.  \\nWe do well as a people of faith to keep asking about God’s timing and our timing. To watch getting caught up in the excessive pleasures or worries of the day, of this season.  To ask how we might be partners in bringing about this new realm of “righteousness and justice?”   We keep the bigger picture of God’s intentions in mind as we are confronted over and over with confusing, problematic and perilous plot turns throughout life. We become the counter-cultural ones, claiming that God is acting in our midst in spite of all evidence to the contrary. God may not come when we want him, but He’ll be there right on time. Thanks be to God!  Amen.',\n",
       " 'He related a story well known to people of Jesus’ time, of the Jewish Maccabean revolt against the brutal Hellenistic ruler of Israel, the Antiochus Epiphanes, about 150 years before Jesus time.  When the Maccabeans return triumphally into Jerusalm, re-taking the city, people throw palm branches in their path.  On Palm Sunday, the people do it again for Jesus, thumbing their collective noses at the Roman soldiers.  It’s an old story, this reality of living in your own land that is now dominated by an oppressive power.  We might think of the original native inhabitants of our own country or the American South at the end of the Civil War.  There are people in our nation today who experience themselves as living in an alienated land. They remain convinced that their government and major institutions seek to insidiously thwart their religious practices and destroy their way of life.   \\nIn the United States, where we seek to keep church and state separate, we might be surprised by what a “political” statement the palm branches were for Jesus’ followers in first century Jerusalem.   The analogy might seem a bit far-fetched, but it would be like us each waving American flags in worship this morning instead of palm branches.   Admittedly, that is a rather provocative image to our contemporary sensibilities.  But Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem carried both religious and political implications that the Biblical narrative seldom shies from addressing.   \\nThe crowds who watched Jesus enter Jerusalem were straining against the increasing tax burden and offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Roman rule. What may be difficult for us to appreciate is how very closely their political situation was of deep religious concern.  It is within this complex, first century historical context, that we need to hear the Biblical narratives of Holy Week.  Now, the Jews knew about exile:  they returned to their Israel after the crushing period of exile under Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE.  For several hundred years, they were again sovereign people, had rebuilt their Temple and reorganized their lives around the direction of the holy Law described in the Torah.   But by the time of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE and through Roman occupation of Jesus’ time, “the Jews faced a new and different trauma,” that had both political and religious ramifications.  The Maccabean revolt around 150 BCE was only a short-lived blip.  The Biblical scholar Paula Fredriksen describes this dilemma in her book, From Jesus to Christ: The Origins of the New Testament Images of Jesus.  She writes: “the experience of Exile had been well incorporated into (Jewish) religious consciousness and their theology,” but “nothing in their tradition prepared them to cope with the crisis of continuing occupation.  Instead of an exile in an idolatrous kingdom, Jews now faced the situation of living in an alienated land.  Their land was now ruled by idolaters whose policies could at any time affect the operation of the Temple itself and the populace’s ability to observe the ordinances of the Torah” (p. 77-78).  It is within this context of “popular unrest and armed confrontation with oppressive occupation,” explains Fredriksen, that the public ministry of Jesus unfolds (p. 82).   But during this unsettled time, there developed a certain way of understanding God’s actions and the world that give meaning and hope to the unsettling present.   Scholars call this the Jewish apocalyptic eschatology, meaning “revelation of hidden knowledge concerning the end times.”  This theological perspective ascribed both meaning to the present suffering and hope for a changed future.  \\nWe can begin to get a sense of how Jesus’ audiences resonated with his preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  They would have understood him primarily through the lense and the longings of this very prevalent theology of restoration. It had evolved into a hope for universal renewal; restored Israel and morally transformed, non-idol worshipping Gentiles.  Prophetic visioning began to happen all over the place, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare, believed they were living in the last days, preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists, rainmakers, all performing signs and wonders that were a signal both of their intimacy with God and as pointing to the End Times, all were common in this period.  Jesus stepped onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  And his vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation.\\nJesus heads to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish Passover.  And suddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he raises the dead, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   Heads turn and the crowd cheers.  People are now singing hosannas and throwing their cloaks on the road, waving palm branches in the air, and welcoming Jesus like royalty.  \\nBut our perspective this morning is a bit wider than theirs.  Off in the distance, in our mind’s eye, we see not just a happy holiday, pilgrim parade; we also see an increasingly an anxious group of followers. The disciples of Jesus know he is in danger; they are beginning to get an inkling that this may not end well.  All the ugly detail starts to roll through our collective memories again:  we see the arrest, the trial and torture; 3 crosses on the hill, and the darkening sky.  \\n The apostle Paul describes in Philippians, that Jesus “emptied himself.”  Paul says that Jesus,  “taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.”  How very tempting it is to quickly move to the “new life” messages of Easter and miss the depths of humbling restoration to which Jesus will call us.  It is an ongoing challenge for us to find meaning in present suffering and hope for a changed future.  Our lives do sometimes feel like an “alienated land” and we long for restoration.  Humbling, pouring ourselves out, almost seems counter-intuitive.  Yet God calls us to hope for and work for a changed future in this kind of servant mode.  How might we talk about these challenges in an even deeper way together and support one another as a congregation?\\nAt the conclusion of today’s passage, Jesus moves into the heart of Jerusalem; he takes a closer look at the city and weeps over it.   “If you had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace,” he moans.  The ambiguity and turbulence of Holy Week will bring complicated themes of life and death.  It will confront us again with the question of God’s awesome and restorative presence in the midst of human suffering. Always the realist, Jesus knew it is not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  There he is, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us; let us follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Talking about prayer can quickly lead us into deep and uncertain waters. Our personal experiences with prayer may give us a sense of blissful communion with a palpable and loving presence.  Or we may have been sorely disappointed in not having prayers answered.  We may face a silent emptiness where we wonder if we are just talking to ourselves.  Actually asking someone about his or her prayer life can feel really awkward, even invasive.  Many people consider their sense of connection with God and how their communicating with God is going, to be a very intimate and private matter.   What is prayer supposed to do?  What do our assumptions do we have about how God acts in response to prayer, if God exists at all?   How do we explain, much less cope with, unanswered prayer?   Especially when we her the Gospel record today, where Jesus tells his disciples, “ask and it will be given to you, search and your will find, knock and the door will be opened for you.”  Today’s scripture introduces both the Jesus prayer, which we call the Lord’s prayer, as a model for praying….one used in our worship each Sunday.  It also describes a story Jesus told in response to his followers request to be taught how to pray.  A cautionary note as we dive in here; most likely all of your questions and struggles or even disinterest in prayer will not be addressed this morning.  But the text invites us to begin a dialogue among ourselves during this time of transition in this congregation, one that I suggest we continue in a variety of settings together.  Because my hunch is that our prayer life, together and each of us alone, may be one of the keys to the reconciling and the moving forward of this conflicted and still hurting church.\\nIn my years of ministry with a number of many mainline churches in our denomination, I have usually found people interested in having discussions about prayer, even in exploring the the Biblical foundations, different theological perspectives and historical practices of prayer.  But actually talking about their own prayer life?  Or praying together in a conversational manner?  Not so much.  That’s more for the evangelical churches, people would say, where it was stereotypically assumed that people would talk of God like a vending machine: I prayed for a guidance on which cake to bake and the Lord said to me “chocolate bunt cake!”  Once, in one of my congregations filled with educated urban people, I rashly invited a small group together to explore prayer with me.  I asked them to commit to a 40 day prayer process described in a rather fundy-sounding (to them) book called “The “Unbinding the Gospel.”   8 typically rational, educated people joined me and committed, with some hesitation, to choosing a prayer partner among the group.  They agreed to do weekly check-ins with that person on how their daily prayer life was going.  Was I able to attend to this today, what was it like? What kept me from meeting God in prayer today? After much initial skepticism, they each reported back to the whole group that sharing with others about this part of our lives had helped them develop an unusual sense of closeness and deepening intimacy with both their partner and with others in the group.  What seemed to be happening was they started talking with each other about their experience of their relationships with God.  They would discuss the ups and downs, the wavering certainties and the embarrassing doubts.  Each of them admitted that this sharing was helping make their experience of God’s presence and trustworthiness grow stronger.  No one reported specific direction on cake baking, or miraculous cures of people they loved.  But they each noted that something within them was opening, deepening.  An inner GPS seemed to be growing inside each of them, that was giving quiet but increasingly steady direction to their daily lives.  \\nToday’s gospel text from Luke throws up a challenge about our prayer lives.  Jesus has just been asked by his disciples: “Lord, teach us to pray.”  He gives them the words of what we have come to call the Lord’s Prayer, which would be well worth exploring more in depth.  A sermon series? Discussion groups?  After lining out the prayer, Jesus follows with this insistent command: “Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.” It is not unusual to hear this imperative and to feel puzzled, even dismayed.  “Wait a minute,” we may find ourselves muttering, “I asked for help and it didn’t come;” or “I searched for that thing, that person, that, and it did not show up” or even “I knocked and banged and pounded on that door of opportunity, that door to my beloved’s heart, that door to my hope for a cure, and it remained firmly shut.”   Wondering if we are to blame, we pepper ourselves with questions: “Did I do it wrong?  Do I not have enough faith, whatever that means?  Did I not pray correctly or enough, or am I not worthy of receiving?”  Wondering if God is to blame, we begin to question God’s good intentions, compassion and infinite mercy, even God’s existence: “Is God actually more like the parent who cruelly gives snakes instead of good gifts to pleading child?”   \\t\\nThe question about unanswered prayer haunts us, and I for one do not know the answer.  I have learned that my wondering about prayer needs to be seen in the wider context of a relationship:  our relationship with the Creator of the Universe who seeks connection with and transformation for each creature.  In the Christian community, we go to the Bible to learn more about this Holy One with whom we have this birthright connection.  But sometimes in the scripture texts, God seems rashly over-involved with humans, getting angry and smitting this one, being pleased and rewarding this one.  Perhaps, as one commentator suggests, we would like God to be a bit more abstract, more detached, cool and calm.  But here’s the thing, he notes: “God at some remove from the world is less threatening to our desire to run the world as we damn well please.” So says the United Methodist theologian, William Willimon. (Willimon, p. 268, Feasting on the Word, Year C, Volume 3).   Through many scripture passages, God is all emotion: loving, waiting, pleading, seeking, begging, yearning to forgive and save Creation.   Over involved to the hilt, no boundaries, persistent, relentless.  There is something of this flavor in Luke’s story today.\\t\\nIn the Gospel records of Jesus’ teachings and actions with other people, we hear of Jesus also at full tilt: challenging, encouraging, calming, confronting, healing, comforting the poor and the rich, the high and the low, the marginalized and the prominent of his time.   \\n“Teach us to pray,” the disciples ask Jesus.  And Jesus is simple and direct, “okay, listen up.  When you pray, go for it.  Ask ask ask.  Ask that God’s kingdom of peace and justice come to earth and be part of that happening.  Ask for daily bread.  Ask for forgiveness.  Ask that you be able to forgive others and that your be able to deal with temptation.”    It may make us feel uncomfortable; it may seem selfish;  but Jesus taught that this is what we are to do and he said that God would be listening.  Always.\\t\\nMaybe part of our struggle is “we want to understand prayer as a mechanism, a formula, a practice so we can master it.”  (David Lose, workingpreacher.org, Pentecost 9C commentary).  In the prayer group I just described, one of the members spoke about how hard it was to start the 40-day of prayer discipline that we all agreed to.  “I wanted to do it right, to really ‘hit the ball out of the park’ in my prayer.”  We all laughed, recognizing that propensity to see prayer as a “mechanism, a formula, a practice” we could master.  Someone else chimed in:  “I guess all we can do is get up there and just swing the bat.  Just keep swingin’!”  Maybe the our question is not about “how prayer works.”  What we may really be asking is a relational question:  it’s about who.  Who do I assume this God is?  What is God’s job description in my view?   If someone I love is really sick, what happens with my prayer for healing?  What does it do?\\t\\nJesus concludes this particular teaching about prayer with a curious story about friendship.  It’s about how very odd it would be if you went to your friend in the middle of the night and asked for something you really needed, and your friend wouldn’t give it to you.  The story would hit home for the listeners, for whom hospitality to those in need was a cultural and religious imperative.  The resistant friend would be publicly shamed by the needy friend banging at his door in the middle of the night.  The needy friend’s “persistence” actually is better translated “shamelessness.”  This is the strange part:  Jesus seems to infer that we are to be not just persistent but shameless, over-the-top, in our asking.  Ask.  Search.  Knock.  Repeat.  \\nPerhaps, this bold and audacious clamoring for God’s attention is actually is good for us.  I have a propensity, as the responsible eldest child, to think God wants me to march ahead and do good works on my own.  Demanding God’s attention is good for me, as it affirms my dependence on God for all things.   Shamelessly bombarding God with our requests and concerns helps us acknowledge our need for God; our need for something beyond our rational egos thinking that can help put everything else in its right perspective.  Ask.  Search. Knock.  Repeat.  Give it a go this week.  And let’s find some ways to talk with each other about this deep, intimate part of our lives.  Amen.\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHowever we each voted, whereever you are experiencing in the aftermath, we all are faced with the reality of living together in a sharply divided country.  We are faced the reality that over half the people who voted are now left with a sense of foreboding and dislocation.  And, I imagine all of us feel a sense of uncertainty as we move forward.  Protests have erupted across the country and outbursts of hateful graffiti and bullying of students of color are already happening in our local schools.  As followers of Jesus, however we voted, we are called to acknowledge that there are those among us and in the wider community who are very scared about their safety and their future in this united-divided states of America.  How to we explore this as a congregation, as we seek deeper sense of community, inclusivity and love among one another and for those outside our doors?  \\n\\t There is a rather stunning sycronicity in the Gospel reading assigned for this Sunday, right after election day.  In using the Revised Common Lectionary shared by Protestant and Catholic congregations all over the world, we step into a flow of scripture passages chosen years ago and offered to us as an orderly way to move through a wide variety of Biblical themes through the church year.  This assigned gospel text for today has a strangely somber and anticipatory mood, as Jesus confronts his disciples enamoured perspective about the fabulous Jersualem Temple.  If a Biblical literalist wants to use signs of disaster to justify God’s punishment of certain people, they often turn to this passage.  But I don’t think that was Jesus’ purpose in noticing the impermanence of human building construction.  \\n\\tUsing imagery of apocalyptic, end-times disasters, Jesus punched through the disciples architectural admirations with cautioning them to notice where their gaze was fixed; what were they paying attention to.  He speaks of coming destruction and suffering.  It’s as if he was saying: You are focusing on the wrong thing!  All you see in this glorious human building will eventually crumble.  You will be like strangers in a strange land and you will be persecuted suffer because of me….and….. God will be moving in all of this!  Not that God causes, or punishes people with all these disasters.  But know that God will be moving in and through all of this.   Here is this dire and grim proclamation from Jesus during a week that has stirred me up big time, and has taken on almost apolcalyptic proportions.  I have started to wonder where my own attention and gaze, my attentive energy is going.  Where do you find your attention fixed in these days? \\nImagine with me this conversation between the disciples and Jesus.  Place yourself in about 33 CE, in this teaming city of Jerusalem, its poplutation periodically sweeled with crowds of pilgrims from far away.  They have come now for the spring Feast of Passover; Jesus and his followers also are here for these seasonal celebrations in the religious hub of the nation.  We stand just outside the enormous Jerusalem temple with Jesus and his friends: constructed to accommodate up to 400,000 worshippers inside and out, huge limestone walls, parts of it covered in gold.  Initially built in the 10th century BEC but destroyed by the Babylonians.  Rebuilt over the centuries and now finally renovated to its previous architectural glory by King Herod the Great.  A Jewish leader, known as for his over-the-top construction projects and for being a puppet king of the ruling imperial Roman occupiers.\\nThere was an emerging thread in Jewish beliefs that certain disasters would preceed the end of history as it is was known, and would initiate God’s full reign of justice and mercy on earth.  Jesus had already alluded to the end times in his teachings, calling himself “the Son of Man,” meaning “the Son of the human one,” a popular term from Hebrew apocalyptic scriptures for one who will appear as God’s emissary.  As Jesus and his followers stand outside the large colonnades and graceful porticoes, the disciples don’t seem to comprehend the looming disaster of Jesus’ confrontation with religious and political authorities, his imminent arrest and imprisonment. Their attention is elsewhere.  “Jesus, aren’t these temple walls and stones amazing!” the disciples gush.  “Incredible what people can do it they put their mind and backs to it!  Wow, awesome,” we can hear them mutter among themselves. \\nLike the 1st century disciples, it is natural to be enthralled by products of human ingenuity that seems so massive and so very permanent.  Be it the Jersusalem Temple, the World Trade Towers, our own homes or businesses, political movements, our church facility.  Yet it can all come tumbling down, for good or for evil.  And it is also natural to become enthralled and overwhelmed by our own human disasters.  A defeat can become to us an armegeddon.  Where is our attention, our gaze, Jesus asks us.\\nThe Temple was be destroyed again in 70 CE, as the Romans squashed a local Jewish uprising that dared challenge their repressive regime.  But Rome too eventually falls; it’s successes, reasoned rule of law and massive military power crumbling.  In the midst of turmoil that seems to be with us in every age, Jesus reminds his followers that God is working in history.  Something incredible, God’s hidden workings, are about to be manifest; they are going to be born among you, says Jesus.  Do not despair over these difficult times, or be led astray by false teachers, he admonishes.  Hold fast, be alert and watchful.  See how these times provide an “opportunity to testify,” suggests Jesus.  \\n\\tSomething profound will begin to happen in you, promised Jesus. “By your endurance you will gain your souls.”  There is something about enduring these difficult times that has to do with re-connecting with our very souls, our inner most selves.   I think this happens as we learn where to put our attention, our seeing in difficult times.  I am helped by remembering that God’s loving, generous gaze is already upon us….each of us.  It was Teresa of Avila, the 17th century Spanish nun and mystic, theologian of the church who wrote: “God looks at us lovingly, searching for room in our hearts. Knowing this, how can we not turn our attention to God?”  -St. Teresa of Avila, \"The Way of Perfection\", 26.3.\\n\\t“God looks at us lovingly.”  Even now, you and I, and I believe our whole country, is being gazed upon most lovingly and generously by God.  Under this generous gaze, I believe that we are offered a curious and audacious task as the Christian community:  we are asked to track God’s movement in this world, in the midst of what feels like to many of us to be an overwhelming mess.  To notice, following God’s compassionate gaze, who is out on the edge, who is vulnerable in this new day, who is marginalizes.  What needs to be done first, then done next and next, as we name and address the divisions and inequities among us?   We pay attention to who is most at risk in our nation right now.  We re-arrange our church priorities to get crystal clear about our support of the wider LGBTQ community, at our part in dismantling racial inequities locally and reaching out to our immigrant communities.  \\n\\tHere’s the thing in times like this:  Something happens within us as we gather together, claiming that the Spirit of forgiveness, integrity and wholeness is working in our midst.  We refocus; we pay attention in new ways.  We learn to testify to the movement of the Spirit in our own lives, in the midst of good times and trying times and tragedies. We find ourselves spreading the word that life is more than meets the eye.  We begin to sense God’s generous gaze, mysterious presence. All the while watching, waiting, welcoming the new world God is creating.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, a lot of sacred cows are about to be slaughtered, I fear. We will see social and environmental benchmarks we have worked for decades summarily undone. (I don’t need to enumerate;\\xa0way\\xa0too depressing.) We must understand this in advance and not let every defeat become an armageddon, a reason for falling on our swords. The earth has a will, and the one body of humanity has coalesced too far to be deconstructed. They will be our partners. They have intelligence and resilience we can draw on, if we can only not lose the way in fear and despair.\\nCynthia Bourgeault\\n\\nDo not be afraid to allow conventional wisdom to fail and disappoint you, which is often the only path to wisdom. Imperial thinking focuses on judging who is worthy and who is unworthy, who is in and who is out. We who know about universal belonging and identity in God have a different form of power: Love (even of enemies) is our habitat, not the kingdoms of this world.\\nRichard rohr',\n",
       " '\\n\\tAs a preface to our Guided Conversation last month, I told the tongue-in-check story of “the perfect pastor.”  I posted that June 26 sermon on our website, if you missed it.  I described the rather outrageous range of expectations congregations often have of their clergy leaders.  A number of you shared with me both how eye-opening, humourous, but disconcerting that depiction was.   Today’s Guided Conversation invites you to consider some more difficult-to-articulate expectations you have about your next pastor.   \\n\\tLast time, you explored your expectations about the pastor’s preaching and teaching among you. Today, we move into a more personal, interior realm of a pastor’s life and being that has enormous consequences on a pastor’s performance of pastoral roles and responsibilities.  In this late-first century letter from an early church leader in Rome named Peter, we a contemporary of the apostle Paul speak to leaders who have oversight over new Christian communities in Asia minor. Peter writes about this precarious connection between spiritual leaders inner lives and their over-all roles and responsibilities as pastoral “shepherds” of their “flocks,” a shepherding metaphor that Jesus had used in his teaching.  These elders, as they were called, were to “tend the flock of God” and have “oversight” among the congregation.  \\n\\tIn a few minutes, the Pastoral Search Committee will invite you to think about leadership styles of “flock tending.”   But first, they are going to ask you to consider something that may be awkward to discuss.  I’m talking about levels of maturity, and core competancies of ones personality, that make doing the myriad tasks of ministry possible.  But can’t we just assume this person will be a self-differentiated, mature adult?  One who has done enough inner, reflective work so that they know their shadow side, they know how they tend to react under stress, can deal with criticizim and don’t take everything personally?  Well…yes you should be able to expect this in a clergy professional…..and pastors are failable human beings doing intimate, powerful work among you that provides numerous possibilities for misue of that intimacy and power.  \\n\\tOne word of caution: today’s conversations are not the place to complain about the behavior of past (or present!) pastors.  If you need to do that, I hope you will come and speak with me personally.  The Committee is asking that you look forward, and ponder the kinds of self-care, (emotional, spiritual, physical, relational, intellectual) you expect this person in this 24/7 stressful position to undertake on a regular basis.    \\n\\tIn this small portion from his letter, Peter has some telling insights about where things can go wrong between the shepherd and flock.  We are to tend the flock and exercise oversight “not under compulsion but willingly.”   This is a tender area for us pastors.  What’s my motivation in coming to work each day?  Pastors have freely chosen a line of work, even as we feel called and compelled by God. The truth is: No one is forcing me. Whenever I find myself whining to myself or my spouse, I have to do thus and so, it brings me up short.  I choose, because I trust that God has guided me into this and I choose to follow that and I bear the consequences. How and where do you expect your pastor to wrestle with this question on an on-going basis? \\n\\tPeter says leaders are to exercise this pastoral oversight “not for sordid gain, but eagerly.”  What on earth is Peter talking about?  “Sordid gain?”  This isn’t about overt misconduct: sex with parishioners or stealing from the offering plate.  Frankly, this is about the pastor’s own ego, her or his own sense of self, of mastery, of capabilness, of power.  Where does my true sense of “being okay,” accepting of my gifts and my limitations, really lie?  Does it lie in my proficiency at doing, being recognized as successfully productive?  Or does it lie in the heart of God who loves me, holds me accountable and wants me to understand and embrace all of who I am?  This is hard for laypeople to talk about because problems in this power-and-influence area can be so subtle.  Something might just feel weird in your interaction with a pastor and you can’t put your finger on it immediately. I sometimes don’t even recognize when I inch over the line of “sordid gain.” It is the little boundary violations that are a problem, the emotional dependency of a pastor on a few select church members, the unwillingness to admit and own a mistake, the taking personally of any criticizism, the tendency to gloat over words of praise.   How would you support a future pastor in finding appropriate places, with the Pastoral Relations Committee, with clergy colleagues, with mentors, with spiritual directors, to stay reflective about these subtle abuses of clergy power? \\n\\tIf you hire someone, you can fire them if they do not fulfill the roles and responsibilities described in their job description.  When you call a pastor to covenant with you in ministry, you still call them into accountability about their performance of roles and responsibilities.  But in a covenantal relationship, the pastor also needs to hold you all accountable.  You all will step into a relationship that is guided by God’s challenging and merciful presence in all of your lives.  It is a relationship based on Jesus’ teachings of mutual respect, honesty, repentance and forgiveness. What do you expect that to actually look like?  May God direct and bless your discussion together this day.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                         \\n\\nWe are searching for a pastor who…\\n•\\tPreaches a sermon that is biblically based, but relevant to our daily lives, and challenges us to do God’s work.\\n•\\tSeeks to appeal to and include all generations in faith formation activities.\\n•\\tMotivates us as church members to take a leading role in worship and faith formation activities using our unique talents.\\n•\\tIs flexible and dynamic.\\n•\\tHas a strong appreciation of music and art.\\n\\n\\nHealthy congregations expect faithful pastors to respect their bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit.

       " '\\n1. Dawn Jones:  Caring\\n2. Skip Wolf:  Community\\n3. Shabryle Setliff:  Inclusiveness\\n4. Britt Weaver:  Spirituality\\n5. Sean Corwin:  Mission\\n\\nThis encounter between Jesus and the 10 lepers would have been quite unnerving for any bystanders that day.  Disciples and townspeople alike would have chalked up the healings to another perplexing instance of good things happening to bad people.  First century people people with leprosy as being sinful for starters, ritually unclean, and outside of God’s grace.   If you were afflicted by this disease, you had to live on the outskirts of town and only approach people at a distance while calling out and warning them: “unclean, unclean.”  Think back to how many communities reacted to people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and you get the idea.  Compassion and caring eroded by fear. As a leper in ancient times, you might be lucky enough to have family who would occasionally drop off food and clothing for you, and some news of your loved ones and community happenings.  You lived on the edges, ignored, or simply unseen. Maybe someone had told this group of people with leprosy about this young rabbi from Nazareth, describing Jesus’ stirring teachings and miraculous healings, and the lepers dared to approach him. They plead with Jesus to “have mercy on us!”   “When Jesus saw them,” records Luke, “He spoke to them.”  Maybe this is the first act of caring: to really see people.  I invite Dawn Jones to speak with us about how she has experienced this value of caring  here at Emmaus.  (DAWN JONES)\\nIf you happened to somehow get cured of an illness like leprosy, you were required to meet with a Temple priest for a special cleansing ritual.  Only then would you be deemed spiritually fit to rejoin the community as a healed, clean and whole person.  I suspect that when Jesus healed people, whether of a disfiguring physical ailment or of emotional or mental distress, he had two intentions: to bring about healing wholeness to the person, and also to reunite and heal the community itself.  Jesus was always looking see how individuals could be re-integrated into the whole.  Skip Wolf will share with us about how we have come to value community here at Emmaus, and what that has meant in his life. (SKIP WOLF)\\nIn an odd way, the leper’s sub-community enacts our fourth Emmaus value of inclusiveness:  somehow affirming diversity in their mutual misery, they allowed a Samaritan man to live with them in their exiled group together.  “Samaritan” was a red-flag word in many of Jesus’ parables:  it’s the person you expect to be the no-good or the story’s villain, who acts with unexpected generosity.  Samaritan’s and Jews were originally tribes of Israel together, but became bitter enemies, taking different sides in conflicts that affected the region, with different holy sites as the center of the ritual and worship.  Not unlike the decades of hostility between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, or Sunni and Shia conflicts within modern day Islam.  Jesus himself sounds surprised that it is the Samaritan who returns to thank him.  To share with us about our Emmaus value of inclusiveness and what this has meant to her, is SHABRYLE SETLIFF.\\nThis story also carries another unexpected twist:  it can be shocking to hear polite words coming from the person you have already denigrated:  this maligned foreigner is the only person in the story who says “thank-you” for his healing. He steps forward and falls at Jesus feet, praising God.  Jesus wonders out loud, so the crowd won’t miss it: “weren’t there 10 of you?  I find it curious that only you (the Samaritan) have returned to give praise to God.”   Being healed becomes more than a medical cure for this man, and even more than a means to be re-integrated into community.  It becomes the means by which he experiences the mystery of unseen power in his midst; the man turns back and begins to praise God.  The value of spirituality speaks to our eagerness here at Emmaus to notice, connect with and talk about things of the Spirit.  The material world, in all its beauty and with all its problems, is not the only reality for us here.  I invite BRITT WEAVER to share with us about how the value of spirituality expressed here at Emmaus has impacted her life. \\nThe Samaritan former-leper is the one person who returns to thank Jesus. “Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”  Again, the person we would least expect, is the one who acts graciously, expressing deep gratitude.  He is the one whose faith doesn’t sit within him like an inert block of belief.  His faith is a verb; he is acting faithfully as he expresses his gratitude.  Something about this, interacting with divine power, has made him well.  Jesus affirms this, but now challenges him:  get up and go on your way, your faith has made you well.  Your active trusting, your initative of gratitude, has changed you.  Get up and go on your way.  And finally, this is what following Jesus and being a church together is all about: it’s about getting up and going on our way into the world, to make a difference in the world.  Here to talk about mission as our fifth value, and how the focus on mission has impacted him and his family, is SEAN CORWIN.   \\n\\tCaring, Community, Inclusiveness, Spirituality, Mission.  These are the values chosen by our numerous small group gatherings.  They come from deep within our Christian tradition, they form us as we soak in our sacred scripture, pray and do the works of ministry with one another.   You have heard the gratefulness expressed by your fellow members for these values.  These values are central to who how we are here at Emmaus.    \\n\\tAnd so we give thanks.  Like the Samaritan man who was healed, we to have the opportunity to turn and  acknowledge our connectedness to Jesus.  We too are receiving of something of great value.  The man thanked and praised God in return, and all of this changed him.   For the many blessings that are here at Emmaus, and the values we share in our ministries here….Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThis morning is our final Sunday in our month of exploring this church’s core values.  We’ve been working off a list of our values identified by a number of you in earlier small group discussions.   Values are assumptions or perspective that guide our behavior as a church, either consciously or unconsciously, and get played out in large and small decisions.  Your Discovery Team, who is working with me on these interim explorations around your identity and purpose as a church, correlated all the input from these discussion.  The values of Community, Love, Inclusivity and Spirituality rose to the top.   \\n\\n\\tToday, I invite you to consider this rather vague and more contemporary word “spirituality.”  It might seem odd that a Christian church would even have to speak that it values “spirituality.”  Isn’t that what a church is about – things of the spirit, being spiritual, spirituality?   The Discovery Team is quite interested in your thoughts about this value.  I hope you will jot some notes on the enclosed card in your bulletin as I’m speaking, and place it one of the offering plates.  If you can, join us for a few minutes after worship for some conversation about this value during Coffee Hour.  We need your feedback.\\n\\n\\tI have noticed this value of spirituality popping up in other congregations when I have led interim periods in a similar values exploration process.  Not unlike here, these have been fairly liberal and progressive churches, comprised of a wide generational spread of people.  I don’t have data to indicate which of these generations indicated that “spirituality” was an important value, as there are often 5 or 6 generations within any vibrant congregation these days.  But I have a hunch!  I think it spirituality was chosen by those who are the tail end of the Baby Boomer generation and younger.   Spirituality, Spirit, Spiritual.  Could this be because Boomers, Generation X and Millennials are getting more Biblical?  I’m not sure.\\n\\n\\tThe Bible talks a lot about the Spirit of God and the work of the Spirit.  The first creation narrative in Genesis speaks poetically of how “in the beginning when God created the heavens and earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a mighty wind from God – the spirit of God – swept over the face of the waters.”  Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, our Old Testament, especially in the writings of the prophets, God’s Spirit is a generative, unsettling, even provocative presence.  The New Testament Gospel writers speak of Jesus’ birth, baptism and ministry as being initiated, infused and guided by the Spirit.  Near his death Jesus speaks of how the Spirit, the Advocate, the Comforter will come to his followers as the “Spirit of truth,” and teach them in all things.  After Jesus is killed and later mysteriously encountered by his disciples, his followers are overwhelmed by a noisy infusion of the Spirit at on the festival Pentecost.  This experience transforms them and compels them to share the Good News of the ongoing forgiving and transformative power of the risen Christ.   The apostle Paul speaks of the fruits of the Spirit in our lives: love joy, peace, kindness, self-control.  He claims that the same Spirit works deep within us, changing us, even praying for us when we are stumped and don’t know what to say to God.  The Spirit prays within us with “sighs too deep for words.”   The words Spirit and spiritual are laced through the Bible.  But there is no mention of the specific word “spirituality.”  \\n\\n\\tSo, I’m not sure younger generations today are specifically getting more Biblical when they wax on about spirituality, although there are some overlaps that it will be important to identify.  What’s happening out in our wider culture, particularly in younger generations, is that people have begun to make distinctions between spirituality and religion.  I started noticing this first with the emergence of New Age writers and practitioners in the late 1970’s, especially out on the West Coast where I lived at the time.  In the late 1980’s I left parish ministry and began working as a chaplain in a chemical dependency recovery unit of a hospital in Monterey County.  As the reality of chemical dependency in our nation because less a moral stigma and better understood as a chronic disease that needed a lifetime of careful managing, more people were talking openly about the recovery process.  Understanding and embracing the spiritual aspects of drug and alcohol addiction and the concept of a Higher Power, was central to any recovery program using the methods of Alcohol Anonymous.  Critical was being able to admit that you were not God and could not function solely on one’s own.  Some kind of belief in and connection with an independent Higher Power was crucial to this process.  You needed to learn to co-partner with some kind of Higher Power, spiritual entity – God as you understood God.  All of which is essentially Biblical, by the way.   \\n\\n\\t It was in this context that I heard it first:  “Well, Chaplain, I want you to know that I am spiritual but not religious.”  Then, often with a distainful look on his or her face, the person would tell me emphatically:  “religion is for people who are afraid of hell, and spirituality is for people (like me) who have been there and back!”   As I listened to people’s personal stories, again and again I heard how institutional religion had judged, shamed and failed these people.  No wonder people wanted to be identified as spiritual but not religious.\\n\\n\\tOne group that surveys our national religion scene, the Pew Religion and Public Life Survey, has been tracking these shifts among us for years.  Their 2012 survey indicated that 20% of Americans no longer maintain a religious affiliation, and this increases with the younger generations.  But 37% of that group describes themselves as “spiritual but not religious.”  Their recently released 2015 study shows an even sharper decline in the religiously affiliated, especially among Christians (May 15, 2015, America’s Changing Religious Landscape, at\\nhttp://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/).\\n\\n\\tThere are a lot of people trying to make sense of all this from within the Christian church scene.  I find one of the most helpful to be Diana Butler Bass, a historian of American religious history, active laywoman in the Episcopal church, author, and consultant to floundering churches and worried denominational leaders across the country.  Her 2012 book, Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening, is still one of the best ways to understand the challenges faced by 21st Christianity.  Butler Bass says that in the post-WWII period most Americans felt compelled to be part of a larger group for self-definition:  a family, a church, a neighborhood, a national identity.  Institutions were mostly trusted and people were used to joining.  Often times, “the what (of these choices) was assumed and the why was unnecessary.”  Within the last 3 decades or so, this has been replaced by a new sense of what defines most people as a person.  Individual authenticity comes from choices you make around self-fulfillment (p. 141-142).  Everything that defines you is now a matter of choice in our consumer-focused culture:  your home, clothes, job and your beliefs. In addition to dual career families, increased economic pressures, changes in the way we raise kids, many people are less likely to look to a local church for a sense of who they are.\\n\\n\\tIn her research with church members across the country, Diane Butler Bass found that many people associate the word spirituality with words like “inclusive,” “searching,” “transcendence, energy,” “wisdom,” “inner life.”  There were also some less positive adjectives like  “individualistic,” “self-centered,” and “lacking in an ethical compass or social justice focus.”  But when the same groups were asked about the word religion, religion got the worse of it.  Words like  “outdated,” “rigid,” “hurtful,” “narrow,” “controlling” “rules,” “heirachy,” and “mean” were cited\\n(Butler Bass, p. 68-69).  “And these words came from people who were church members!” notes Butler Bass, adding that “no matter the region or denomination all the groups associated spirituality with experience and religion with institutions” (p. 70).  \\n\\n\\tYounger people, in general, seem to see religion and churches as inflexible and judgemental. Many of them fully expect most churches to oppose Friday’s Supreme Court decision allowing for same sex-marriage.   I have found that Gen X and Millennial individuals and families with children are often drawn first to the UCC because of its Open and Affirming stance.\\n\\n\\tAnd here is the crux, I think, of why “spirituality” has been identified as an increasingly central value.  There is hunger among us, particularly in younger generations, for authentic experience of both inclusivity and mystery.  There is an eagerness to explore authentic ways to connect with the divine, to God, ourselves and others.  It’s not just about connecting with a community of people (sports and non-profit groups provide that well); it’s about connecting with God.  There is a yearning for a sense of mystery and connection with the unseen.  It is not that these individuals, myself included, reject all the accomplishments of the Enlightment with its focus on rational, linear thinking.  Don’t think for a minute that this is an anti-scientific, or anti-evolution, stance among these younger, spiritual seekers.  \\n\\n\\tAnd we have to offer them more than intellectual discussions about God.  They are hungry for encounters with God and vulnerable discussions with others about how they are experiencing the movement of the Spirit in their lives.   But I often find a hesitancy, an embarassment even, in liberal, progressive institutional churches when it comes to talking about the movement of the Spirit in individual lives and in the lives of the church as the Body of Christ.   How might we encourage more vulnerable conversation among us here, about this tender, private and important dimension of our lives as Christians?\\n\\n\\tI think it will be quite interesting and fruitful to explore together what you mean by “spirituality.”   For I have seen that to open more fully to the work of the Spirit is the key to re-vitalization of a congregation.   May God’s Spirit continue to unsettle, disrupt, transform and guide us in the days ahead.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe disciples of Jesus have basically gone into hiding.  This is the setting for today’s reading from the Gospel of John.  It is the night after the day that several of Jesus’ women followers discovered the empty tomb.   Jesus had been publically humiliated and executed as a troublesome teacher and prophet.  He was perceived as threatening the well being of the whole Jewish community.  The Jewish leaders were struggling to maintain a fragile peace with the occupying Roman legions.  But Jesus’ magnetic presence and compelling teachings had gathered crowds and created public disturbances.  He mingled with those on the margins, those considered to be unclean and impure in his culture.  His proclamations on equality, distribution of wealth and acts of civil disobedience were troubling to those in power.  The religious leaders decided Jesus needed to be stopped for the good of the whole and dragged him before the Roman executioners.  Following the harrowing crucifixion scene, Jesus’ disciples are now terrified that the authorities will come after them too.  They have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.\\n\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what is going on in the disciples’ minds at this point.  Perhaps they are hoping that if they can just stay hidden for a while maybe things will calm down.  Can they slip out of Jerusalem and return to their fishing businesses and family life? But those troublesome women disciples have not been hiding. They went to the tomb, and they keep insisting Jesus is alive.  But Jesus being alive would be a disturbing thought, for most of his followers have betrayed and abandoned him.  \\n\\n\\tThen, all of a sudden, in the midst of a hasty evening meal and anxious conversation behind locked doors, Jesus is standing in the middle of the room.   “Peace be with you,” he announces.  It is hard for us to imagine what this would have been like, all of a sudden seeing your dead teacher and leader standing before you, showing you his wounded hands and side.  Shock, bewilderment, joy.  The disciples must have felt a wild mix of emotions.   Our 21st century minds may find the whole idea unscientific, illogical, and even ridiculous.  Yet over and over the New Testament writers make these reports of Jesus’ appearances, which seemed to occur over a period of 50 days following Easter.  And somehow, these encounters with the living presence of the Risen Jesus changes everything for his followers. \\n\\n\\tIn all the appearances, as happens here, Jesus’ followers don’t recognize him at first.  He’s not a ghost, but not quite recognizably human either.  Is it in response to the obvious confusion and fear on their faces that Jesus says to them: “peace be with you?”  He shows them his wounds on his hands and side. These disciples may well have been hoping to never run into Jesus again, given their complicity in his death.  It wasn’t just Judas who betrayed Jesus.   His close friend Peter denied knowing him and most of the rest of them ran and hid.  What are they expecting Jesus to say?  “Thanks a lot, you guys.  Way to be there for your friend.”   But no, “peace be with you….as the Father sent me, so I send you.”  No condemnation here.  Only affirmation.  Only honoring and now commissioning….sending.   John describes how Jesus “breathed on them,” saying, “receive the Holy Spirit.  If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”\\n\\n\\tAnd it all starts with: “peace be with you.”  I am reminded of how we are invited to “pass the peace of Christ” each Sunday near the beginning of our worship service. The words sometimes seem awkward and It’s easy to lapse into a “hi, how are you?’” kind of salutation during this time.  Folks end up chatting about church business or baseball scores or after-worship plans.  I invite us to reconsider these words of Jesus: “peace be with you.”  What is the purpose of saying this?  What are we trying to accomplish in those moments of greeting?  Or, what might we be extending to one another if we were to look each other directly in the eye and say these words: “peace be with you” - ?   \\n\\n\\tTo extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of Christ, is no casual thing, I believe.  This is not just “being friendly.”  “Peace be with you” one person says; and “and also with you” the receiver responds.  There is an old-fashion formality to it that may feel strange. I don’t mean to suggest we should greet each other on Sundays with only these four words.  Of course, other words might naturally follow.  But, I am suggesting that the words themselves are a gift we give each other.  I am inviting us to say try on these words and to ask ourselves:  “what am I imagining, what am I hoping for, when I extend the peace of the Risen Lord, the peace of God, to another person?”  Jesus challenged his disciples to forgive others and their sins would be forgiven; he warned them that if they retained the sins of any, they would be retained.  Could there be some connection here between extending peace and acknowledging forgiveness?   How might we live into this challenge more fully?\\n\\n\\tThe early Christian communities quickly gained a reputation for some fairly radical lifestyle choices.  We remember that they are living in a Middle Eastern world of first century Roman occupation.  A stratified society of ruling elites, massive underclass, slavery.  Military might, carefully engineered roads, magnificent architecture, economic power were all highly valued.  But we just heard in the Book of Acts that the early followers of the Risen Jesus were known for their being of “one heart and soul,” for a remarkable sense of close community that broke down all kind of social and class barriers.  They were also known for their sharing with one another and with those in need.  “Everything they owned was held in common” and “there was not a needy person among them.”  A remarkable generosity infused their dealings with one another.  This was highly unusual in there time.  Dan Clendenin, a contemporary Biblical scholar, writes on his web-blog “Journey with Jesus” that these two characteristics of loving community and incredible generosity account for the huge number of converts in Jerusalem.  People wanted to join this “emergent Jesus-community” because it was so different from the rest of their culture.  \\n\\tIt occurs to me that this is the standard for Christian community to which every church is held:  Are we different from the rest of our predominant culture that values individual freedom, competition, power and material goods above all else?   What does it look like to be so counter-cultural as a congregation that we become known for our “loving community and incredible generosity?”\\n\\n\\t“Peace be with you,” we say to one another.  Perhaps that is where we start.  We don’t really know, on any given Sunday, what a person brings with them to worship.  We don’t really know the full extent of the worries or fears, the sadness or anxiety.  We can barely imagine the difficult memories or painful resentments, or the depth of their material need, or even the stultifying boredom, that lies on the hearts of our fellow worshippers.  Each of us, at one time or another, comes to worship “locked” in something, just like the disciples who were locked behind closed doors.    A newcomer may be in our midst, here for reasons we don’t really know or may not understand.   A longtime member could be sitting next to you filled with all kinds of unpeaceful feelings or thoughts, with emotional and spiritual needs that we can’t comprehend.    “Peace be with you,” we say to stranger and close friend alike.  A spirit of love and forgiveness is here.  “Community and generosity is here for you, as it is for me,” we signal one another. \\n\\n\\tWe are not here on Sunday mornings to be entertained or to have our own private spiritual experience.  There is plenty of religious entertainment on television and the Internet.  The woods, streams and lakes all around us are a good place to commune with God in uninterrupted private.  Church attendance is no longer a way to gain social status in most communities in this country.  And there are easier and more comfortable ways to visit with your friends than to sit through an hour of worship in a pew! \\n\\n\\tWe come to communal worship because we want a transformative experience of the living God, among other people.  We want in on this radical kind of community where social and class barriers might dissolve and we grow together in forgiveness, as “one heart and soul.”  We want to be part of a generous congregation which makes lunches for a local homeless shelter, paints and pounds nails together building low-cost housing, collects canned stew to re-stock empty food pantry shelves, sends disaster relief to all parts of the world.  We are here because we long to connect with the God whose peace draws us into community and generosity. \\n\\n\\tWhat a gracious and hopeful thing to say to one another in our worship time:  “peace be with you.”  Simple words, but they are Jesus’ words.  “Peace be with you” Jesus repeated a second time to the startled disciples.  “As the God has sent me, so I send you.”  And so we are offered God’s peace; and so we are sent.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:  \\n\\tThe “generosity and community” reference describing the early Christian community, as reported in the Book of Acts, comes from Dan McClendenin (Journey with Jesus website).\\n\\tThe writings of Rowan Williams, former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, have influenced my understanding of the disciples’ reactions to Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances (Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel).

       " 'So today’s text featuring two women is unusual, which is often a Biblical author’s sly way of signaling that something important is being revealed.  We encounter female characters who both happen to be pregnant: Mary the mother of Jesus and Elizabeth her cousin, and mother of John the Baptist.  At first glance, the narrative appears to be all about unusual conception circumstances; one is a young virgin and one has been barren up through old age.  These were clearly unusual pregnancies in their first century day.  But in our 21st century perspective, this is a problematic story detail for other reasons.  For us, having a baby before marriage may not be the great shock or shame that it was for my grand-parents or parents’ generation, and medical advancements are bringing us an increasing number of older mothers.   But this story may grate against our sensibilities because it sounds ridiculously unscientific.  It sounds irrational, sentimentalized, even, this business of God’s Holy Spirit being in the “in utero” business.   Our intellect may figure the whole tale is a ruse, and we might as well just settle back into Baby Jesus as a Nice Fairy Tale.  Let’s just get on with trying to follow his teachings and be good people.  Incarnation, God coming to us in human flesh, the stuff of Christmas once we get underneath the wrapping paper, the food and festivities:  all this sounds unlikely and embarrassingly irrelevant, like a story from Greek mythology where people are born by popping out of someone’s head.   \\nThis story of these two women can also be a stumbling block for us in other ways.  We no longer live in a culture where a woman’s worth is measured by her ability to reproduce, do we?  This whole thing about barren women finally getting blessed with a baby feels a tad old-fashion and even demeaning to women in general.  And this idea of God sending particular women a healthy baby can also be disturbing, if we or someone we love has been through amiscarriage, an abortion, stillbirth or the inability to conceive in the first place.  \\nBut here we are, the Fourth Sunday of Advent and the Gospel of Luke is describing an encounter between these two pregnant women.  Perhaps you saw this week’s church email, our TAB, where I included a portion of the 15th century German altar painting depicting Mary and Elizabeth joyfully greeting one another.  And each with tiny baby boy figures in a cut-away of each of their bellies, hailing one another in recognition:  “Yo, Jesus!” and  “John, how’s it going in there?”  the little figures seem to say.  As I studied it more closely, I noticed baby John is pictured on his knees, with little hands held together in prayer, while seated infant Jesus casually leans back with his arm raised in a curious blessing fashion.   Interesting, given that adult Jesus will eventually present himself to adult John the Baptist, at the River Jordan, to repent of his own sins and to be baptized into new life!\\nBut back to the moms.  Only two out of the four Gospel accounts tell us anything about Jesus’ birth, and only the Gospel of Luke goes into detail about Mary and Elizabeth.  It has been said (Dominc Crossan and Marcus Borg, in First Christmas) that the birth stories in both Matthew and Luke, have widely disputed historical origin, but they are very significant theologically.  They say a lot about God and what God is doing in Jesus.   Scholars have noted that these birth narratives can be best understood as “overtures.”  Matthew and Luke’s stories present a set of different details about Jesus’ birth that reveal in a microcosim the wider themes that the Gospel writer is going to lay out in his telling about Jesus.  What will Luke focus on when he tells us about the life and teachings of Jesus?  Luke will describe the Holy Spirit infusing the lives of people who preceed Jesus (like Mary and Elizabeth) and Jesus’ life itself.  Luke will emphasize many different women that Jesus encounters in his ministry. Luke will relate stories about Jesus interacting with other marginalized and powerless of his time: people living in poverty, sex workers, tax collectors, slaves.   If a musical “overture” gives us a sense of where an opera or a musical is going, the “overture” of Luke’s birth story gives a sense of what Jesus’ adult life will be like.  Holy Spirit works through this man, who reaches out continually to those who are marginzalized and powerless.\\nIn Luke’s story, we have been told that this young Mary is engaged to man of the lineage of King David, but Joseph stays off-stage in the narrative.  After encountering the angel with it’s astounding news of her conceiving, she curiously leaves town.  Brave, or naively foolish, she sets out with haste, on her own, to a town about 80 miles into the hill country.   Biblical commentators have observed that with her pregnancy, she faces social judgement and shame, possibly even ostracism or even stoning.  She heads for the companionship of a kinswoman who has know such shame all of her adult life, because she herself has been seen as “barren.”   I imagine the exhaustion and relief Mary might have felt, finally spotting her kinswoman Elizabeth’s home, and wondering how she will be received.  At the sound of Mary’s voice, Elizabeth feels a swift baby kick….her first?  Sending a signal of what?  In a flash, Elizabeth recognizes her own child; the boy within recognizes his cousin?  And Mary witnesses in Elizabeth’s joyful face a a welcome, companionship, a mercy, a safe sanctuary.  And here we see it, according to the Gospel writer: this is the dawn of the new age, the great reversal of the kingdom of God.  Where there should be judgement and shame, there is welcome and acceptance.   Elizabeth takes on the prophetic mantle and blesses Mary, calling her blessed, naming the baby within her as blessed, celebrating Mary because Mary has allowed God to work through her.  And Mary starts to sing:\\n“My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for God has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant.”  She goes on to sing of how God’s mercy is show from generation to generation, echoing the praises of all the prophets before her.  “God has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts, God has brought down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up the lowly.”  These are the signs of the breaking in of God’s reign on earth.  “God has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.”  Is it any surprise that Jesus will end up sounding a lot like his mom, writes Karoline Lewis on her workingpreacher blog on this passage.  Mary gave witness to the God she experienced and knew, and she surely taught this to Jesus as well. \\nI picture their encounter, these two women, and I wonder:  who needs to receive a sense of welcome and blessing in my life?  I’ll bet each of us knows someone who is out on the margins, in our families, in our worksplace, in our church, who feels social judgement, ostracism, maybe even an isolating sense of shame.   The Holy Spirit dwells within each of us.  Can we let the Holy Spirit give us a “baby kick” of recognition? Could Luke be modeling for his late first century congregation, to whom he writes this gospel about Jesus, how we should be for one another?  Might we be nudged into some welcoming and blessing action of our own this week?   You and I may be called to show certain others that God’s kingdom is one of reversal: unexpectedly, the lowly will be lifted up.  The shamed and ostracized will be shown mercy and given sanctuary.  May God’s Spirit nudge us into recognition and action.  That’s the Biblical challenge as I see it for this week, as we edge towards the birth of the one who moves and blesses among us still.  Amen. \\n\\n\\n(I didn’t specifically use this poem below, but it gave me a few ideas.

It grates against our predominate culture that tells us “full” is best.  A full bank account, full refrigerator, full-time job.  And these are nothing to skoff at because “empty” can bring enormous suffering.  Empty wallet, empty place at the table, empty stomach, empty house, empty heart.  But one of the problems with living in a world that celebrates “full” over “empty” is that we begin to think “empty” is the end of the story.  A failure or mistake means we are a complete looser, death of a beloved means we will never know love again, a missed opportunity obliterates all hope.  \\nYet, what Mary discovers is that this empty tomb turns these assumptions upside-down; her teacher and friend was dead and is now alive.  This is not some idea to be affirmed or denied; it is an immense energy that will propel her back into her ordinary life.  “Go and tell you brothers,” says the Risen Jesus.     \\n\\tPerhaps at Easter we are reminded that there is a parallel universe to all that seems so important in our visible world.  It’s the unseen universe of God’s persistent attention and love that says that tragedy, despair, even death are not the last word.  And God is continuinally bringing new possibilities and hope to us while we live and even after we die.  In some curious sense, on Easter, death is now dead.  In emptiness there can be the power of new life. The empty places in our lives may be cleared ground.  Perhaps they are the wide-open space that God needs for new growth within us, for re-focused priorities, for change.  \\n\\t\\n\\n\\nThis is a huge thing to claim and we can spend a lifetime learning to lean into this reality.

       " '\\tOur scripture passages are filled with bread references this morning. But more often then not, bread is a no-no in our weight conscious culture.  So it may be difficult for us to understand just how sacred bread was in the ancient world.  And really, how treasured and revered it still is for many people in less developed countries.  I have heard that a piece of bread found on the street in the Middle East is carefully retrieved, reverently touched to the lips and placed in a crevice of a wall or a branch for a bird to find.  Of course, large populations of the world don’t eat bread at all; they gain their major nourishment from rice.  But in the Biblical world, and still throughout the Mediterranean, Europe and much of the new world that became the United States, the possession of bread means sustenance. “Bread” is slang for money. Having bread means the ability to care for your family.  Bread is a visible sign of God’s sacred gift of life and extravagant generosity.  “Give us this day our daily bread,” we pray, as we hope for renewed energy tomorrow.  But for most of us, we are far away from the threat of daily and bread as a necessary staple. We have little sense of the true miracle of a piece of bread. \\n\\nWe hear the Exodus passage with this curious tale of manna falling from heaven in the wilderness this morning, we might wonder to ourselves:  What?  Middle eastern style pita bread dropping down from the clouds?  This story will be told over and over again in Jewish and later in Christian traditions:  this event will be understood as a sign of God’s mercy and grace: the flakey manna particles made into fried bread cakes that saved the starving Israelites several months out after fleeing their oppressors in Egypt.  Later, the Psalmist will describe this miracle in liturgical poetry, recounting how the people ate “the bread of angels” and received “food in abundance” along with the meat of small birds that dropped at their feet.   The Jewish crowds who pressed around Jesus in the first century will refer to this Exodus miracle where their “ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness,” given to them by their leader Moses.  And Jesus will acknowledge the ancient miracle. But he will remind them that it was not Moses, but God who gives them (moving into present tense) the true bread from heaven.  “For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world,” Jesus will say.  \\n\\nWhen I pause in this text for a moment, I can almost see the Gospel author John, standing up and waving at his readers, in this point in the discourse between Jesus and the crowds:  “READER, PAY ATTENTION!  I am not reciting history here any more!  I am telling you about who Jesus is!”  Well, obviously, we think to ourselves, Jesus is NOT a loaf of bread.  What is John doing here?  “For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world,” John records Jesus as saying.   But Jesus listeners are not really getting this:  “Sir, give us this bread always.”  Like the Samaritan woman at the well who says to Jesus, “sir, give me this water, so I won’t thirst again.”  \\n\\nClean water, fresh bread.  These people need these things, so they take Jesus literally, almost like he is some kind of magical food vendor.  Who could blame them, peasant people living on the margin?  Just collecting daily bread and water took all of their energies and was never certain from day to week.  Wow, a never-ending supply of bread for my family, “oh please, sir, might I have this bread always?!”   \\n\\nBut Jesus is already moving deeper.  And it’s at this point in the story that the Gospel writer John is flagging his readers to pay close attention.  And then “Jesus said to (the people), ‘I am the bread of life.’”  I am the bread of life.  We do well to remember that John was writing to his community 40-50 years after Jesus crucifixion;  Imperial Rome has destroyed the Jerusalem temple; it was a time of turmoil within Judaism and growing persecution among the tiny Christian sect.  John’s community will read the Jesus’ words “I am” and remember the great encounter between Moses and God in the burning bush:  where God call’s Moses to save his people from slavery in Egypt.  But what’s your name? asks Moses.  “I Am.”   “I am” is known as God’s name, God’s identity, in John’s Jewish Christian community.  SIT UP AND PAY ATTENTION, John seems to be saying….“Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.”  John’s will be the only Gospel to use this metaphoric language, using it to connect God and Jesus:  I am the bread of life, I am the Good Shepherd, I am the resurrection, I am the true vine, I am the way, the truth and the life.     \\n\\nPrecious, necessary, sacred bread.  Jesus is saying he is the Bread of Life.  John’s harassed and persecuted community will understand this in their bones:  Jesus is indeed the Bread, the sacred sustenance, the extravagant gift of nourishment.  They feed on him regularly!  They will immediately remember their regular celebrations of the Lord’s Supper, when they share bread and wine, they bring extra food and it is distributed to the poor.  Communion is not some memorial dinner for them, but participation in the spirit of the living Christ who is present with them at the table, over and over again.  They feast on him daily, in prayer and song. This is how they build up the Body of Christ that is them together as the church. This is the spiritual food that builds them up in their radical new life of giving and sharing and proclaiming and trusting.\\n\\nWhen our children were younger, my husband and I used have a joke about the frequency of meals.  “Oh my gosh,” we would complain to each other, “we have to plan, shop, and prepare dinner AGAIN?”  We both love to cook, but it was this repetition, this repeated need to nourish and be nourished that sometimes overwhelmed us.  Perhaps with that same exasperation, my mom used to complain that my siblings and I were like hungry little birds with our mouths wide open.  Everyday, our bodies need continual nourishing.  What is not so obvious is that everyday our individual spirits and the communal Body of Christ needs continual nourishing.  Jesus knew this.  Take and eat, this is my body broken for you.  Feed on me.  The need for this frequency sometimes overwhelms us.  “But I came to worship twice last month, in the middle of the summer,” we might protest.  Eat again says Jesus.  “But I prayed and read scripture some last week.”  Feast again, says Jesus.  Feed on my living presence in your midst.  Daily.  In silence, in scripture reading, in silence, in prayer. Repeatedly.  Let me nourish this inner being, this soul of yours, says Jesus.  \\n\\nNo resting on laurels or on yearlong supplies of bread.  The manna was only good for one day; the Israelites had to return to their dependence of God’s generosity each morning.  Over and over.  Collect the food, feed the family.  The same with bodies, the same with our souls.  Sometimes it makes me roll my eyes; it’s like my frustration with exercise:  but I worked out at the Y yesterday, I whine.  the dailyness of it all is what keeps us nourished.  I prayed yesterday, we might complain.  I helped the poor last week!  I sent money to feed the hungry last month!  Yes, says Jesus.  Now do it again.\\n\\nI am the bread of life, said Jesus.  Take and eat, this is my body broken for you.  Feed others with the me that is in you, instructs Jesus.  And then repeat this.  Again.  Give us this day our daily bread, we pray.  Give us this day our Risen Lord.  Nourish us, dear God, feed us Jesus.  Amen. \\n',\n",
       " 'Let us, then, be up and doing,\\nWith a heart for any fate;\\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\\nLearn to labor and to wait.\\n\\n\\nBEGINNING, AGAIN\\n\\n\\tEach time I begin a new interim ministry position with a congregation, I picture myself boarding a moving train.  Or rather, I see myself jogging along side and attempting to leap onto the moving train of an already active congregation!  Emmaus UCC has clearly not stood still “in the station” since your most recent settled minister departed in May.  Within a few days of being here, I have encountered over 1000 items of food you collected piled in this Sanctuary, destined for local food shelves.  My family and I have experienced the hospitality of your EmmausCares lay pastoral care group in the form of a huge prepared dinner the night we moved into town.   I’ve observed building repairs involving mysterious water flowage dispatched with minimal fanfare and the many small acts of generosity that make up your ongoing network of care for one another.  I’ve listened with a grateful heart as the Transition Committee prayed for each other at the end of a planning discussion earlier this week. Within one hour yesterday, I was invited to join in blessing new prayer shawls with the Spiritual Creating group and then filled up on delicious potluck and lively conversation with the young parents gathering.  And this isn’t the half of what went on here last week. This place is jumpin’!\\n\\tAs I reflect on this passage from the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, I see God’s words made real in your midst already:  “I am about to do a new thing,” says God, “now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?”   Our God seems to be big on new things, new beginnings.  Already I can sense this renewed energy springing up among you, and I have only just arrived.   \\n\\tI chose the portion of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem because it reflects this spirit of beginning again that I am sensing here at Emmaus.  And I also chose this piece because it may also issue us a few challenges.  “Let us be up and doing.”  Well, clearly, this is something you all do well.  So many of you are “up and doing,” building up the Body of Christ that is Emmaus as your work in ministry together.  You have had a change in minister before.  Beginning again with different pastoral leadership is not new to many of you.  The “up and doing” part seems clear:  hire the interim, start the search for the settled minister so we can move forward and grow this place!  It’s natural to see the task and insist: let’s get it done already.   \\n\\tLet’s hear the next line:  “Let us, then be up an doing, With a heart for any fate.”  Now that is interesting.  Do we have a “heart for any fate” that might happen next here?  This is challenging for most of us: holding an open heart while activating our clever and resourceful brains in achieving a task.  Maintaining an open heart in face of an uncertain future.  It has a certain vulnerable feel to it, “Open heart.”  The words may make us feel a tad uncomfortable and wary.   Yet, you and I don’t really know what it will be like over the months or even years of us working together in ministry here.  There will the bumps in the road, and probably all kinds of mistakes and misunderstandings between us as interim minister and congregation, and between you all as members.  I’ve been here long enough to learn that you have had some of these in both the recent and distant past.  You have lived through some rugged and painful history as a congregation.  What might it be like to talk about the challenges and the blessings of your history together….with open and vulnerable hearts?  Open hearts are needed in order to learn from the past, so the worst is not repeated. As churches, we learn from the past to also see where we have been at our best, so we can stand on the strengths and assets of a particular place and people as we move into the future.  Open hearts are needed as we learn to talk and listen to one another in new ways, as we disagree with respect and hang in there with each other.  “Still achieving, still pursuing, learn to labor” – yes, clearly, this place is certainly filled with hard workers and high achievers.  But here is perhaps the biggest challenge in Longfellow’s words:  “learn to labor and to wait.”  To wait?  If the “heart for any fate” part hasn’t given us pause already, the poem seems to screech to a halt on these words “to wait.”  “Still achieving, still pursuing, learn to labor and to wait.”  These two words do not fit into our busy and impatient world.  Waiting is not something we think of doing when faced with change and beginning again.  It sounds so passive, so diminutive, so ineffectual.\\n\\tI hear in these words an echo of the Buddhist notion of not being attached to outcome; simply doing right action without expectation of the result.  I also sense a hint of how beginnings might involve such active waiting as I pondered this story of the widow and her two coins.  This is a rather intriguing story as Mark tells it, and we might be left wondering if the widow really made a good choice in supporting the livelihood of these nefarious Temple scribes with her last penny.   \\t\\n\\tWe remember that Jesus of Nazareth seemed to have a preference for little, insignificant things. In his teaching stories he would talk about little lost sheep, small coins misplaced in a house, tiny mustard seeds, and today in Mark this story of the widow dropping a miniscule gift in the temple offering box.  Jesus spent a lot of time with the little, insignificant people of his time, the lowly street people, the reviled sex workers of his day, the resented tax collectors, the repulsive folks with leprosy, and all those scrappy bothersome poor people.   Jesus had a penchant for paying attention to things that might seem insignificant to the rest of the world.  He knew that seemingly passive, diminutive, ineffectual people and actions are part of the Kingdom at work in our midst.\\n\\tThe scribes of this story were not Jewish priests in the temple.  They were a rich class of educated landowners, found in the urban centers and specializing in interpreting Jewish law.  Some of them were known for their manipulation of the poor, including powerless widows.  Jesus was clearly using them as an example of “hypocrisy and overly pious behavior.” \\n\\tJesus has already tangled with the Temple leadership, flipping over the tables of the moneychangers, and thwarting their efforts to ensnare him in a theological war of words.   But here Jesus talks about the scribes disregard for and even misuse of the poor, especially the widows who under Jewish law were supposed to receive the care and support of their communities.  As Jesus sits down with his disciples in the shadows opposite the Temple offering boxes, he watches some wealthy people contribute large sums.  And then a poor widow approaches and drops in two coins, the equivalent of a penny.  Jesus notes that she has “contributed out of her poverty” and “given everything she had.”  \\n\\tWe talk a lot in church about giving out of our abundance, sharing with others as a response to the blessings of bounty that we have received in our lives.  This is not a bad thing.  Maybe this giving out of our abundance, like the rich people in the story, is like the first part of the Longfellow poem:  Be up and doing.  Still achieving, still pursing.  We do all that out of our abundance of energy, of time, of talents and resources.  Maybe Jesus calls our attention to the widow because she gave out of her poverty.  She gave out of emptiness of pocket and resources, out of what seems passive, diminutive and ineffectual.  \\n\\tInterim times in churches are difficult because we want to be achieving and pursuing, laboring towards the end of getting a settled minister, right away.  But I have found in my experience of working with a number of churches in transition times, that a good match between congregation and settled minister is rarely the result of achieving and pursuing.  It does not happen just because we quickly throw our capable brains, our logical assumptions and generous resources into the search process.   Making this good match is basically a slow spiritual discernment process.  Like any discernment process that seeks to learn God’s will for our lives, it involves both labor and waiting.   Listening to God speak and direct us takes a certain amount of passivity and quiet, reflection on scripture and the needs of the world around us.  It takes an unhurried openness of heart.   And ironically, we may have to give this effort not out of our abundance of skills and resources, but out of our poverty.  Out of our not knowing.  Out of an open, expectant heart that welcomes an uncertain outcome.  Maybe this is what Jesus was talking about when he said, “blessed are the poor in spirit.”  Discerning God’s will for me often involves leaning into the places where I feel broken and impoverished, where I can’t depend on my talents and good graces….where I am vulnerable, and maybe where I am most open to the “new thing” that God is doing in my life.\\n\\tThat will be our task together, in the months ahead, to be in discernment about where God is calling you all to next as a church.   As we move through this discernment process, you will become clearer about the kind of new leadership you will need to do the ministries God is calling you to do as a congregation.  So, join us in worship as often as you can; this will keep us focused on the spirit of the Living Christ in our midst, and give us inspiration and nourishment for the interim work ahead. I encourage you to be patient with the interim process and honest with me about how you experience my leadership.  Speak with me directly; don’t go sideways and “triangle” someone else you’re your dissatisfaction.  Know that I am here with you, with gratitude and hopefulness for all that we will discover in our interim ministry together.  “Let us, then be up and doing, with a heart for any fate; still achieving, still pursing, learn to labor and to wait.”   Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tThere was a point during the recent Democratic National Convention when a young speaker with a clerical collar slowly approached the podium.  Rev. William Barber, Christian Church, Disciples of Christ pastor from North Carolina, proceeded to speak passionately about the heart of our democracy.  He described how our inaction on social justice issues is doing to our democracy, from “gun violence, to deteriorating relationships between police and communities of color, to climate change” (Esquire on-line, July 27, 2017, Jack Holmes) and economic disparity is harming that heart.  In challenging the assembly “to be moral defibulators of our time” and to “shock this nation and fight for justice for all” he pointedly noted that we need to work save our nation’s “heart” together.  He challenged the assembly to stop focusing so much attention on what Jesus gave little attention to….and to turn our attention to where Jesus focused a lot.  \\n\\tRev. Barber may well have had today’s scripture theme in mind.  Money, possessions, acquiring stuff, treasure.  Almost half of Jesus parables deal with the connection between money and our spiritual well-being:  The dangers of wealth, misguided focus on possessions and the disparity between the rich and the poor was one of Jesus’ favorite topics.   Yet, many parts of the Christian church stays myopically focused on debating sexuality and gender roles, private sexual morality and sexual orientation.  But Jesus kept talking about money.  He certainly seemed to have an uncanny sense that the way we use money reveals a lot about who we really are, and where the deepest priorities of our hearts truly lie.  \\n\\tAs we consider today’s text, we pay attention to the context of the story.  A huge crowd had gathered that day; the Gospel writer Luke numbers them in the thousands, noting that they were pushing and trampling on each other in their eagerness to hear Jesus.  It is while Jesus is speaking an aside to this circle of close followers, that he warns that they should not be afraid of their bodies being killed.  And in the same breath, reassures them that even the sparrows are not forgotten in God’s sight, and therefore the disciples are not to be afraid: God values them even more than the sparrows.   This is a telling preface to today’s story:  you may die, yet your security lies elsewhere.  Your security and safety lies in God’s valuing of you.  Let your heart sink into this. Do not be afraid.\\n\\tWell, this is a conundrum.  God values me but might let me be killed.? What’s God’s valuing of me worth?  While the disciples are chewing on this paradox, all of a sudden someone in the large crowd calls out:  “Teacher!  Tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me! “ Jewish law prescribed that the oldest son would normally receive double the younger son’s share of any inheritance.   But Jesus refuses to mediate this family feud, and shifts his attention to what may underlie the man’s request:  Friend….take care!  “Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”   Our accumulated possessions and what they mean to us.  “Where your heart is, there your treasure is also” Jesus warned.\\n\\tI got word last week that my close friend and United Church of Christ colleauge, ocean lover and marine advocate, founder of the Blue Theology movement, is on the brink of loosing all of her possessions.  Her and her husband’s simple hand-built home lies in rural Palo Colorado, in the path of the raging fires in Big Sur, on the Central Coast of California.  Having evacuated in the middle of the night, they await news of whether or not their home, like some 40 others, will also be destroyed.  From the safety of a friend’s home in town, Deborah described by phone how they quickly gathered some art work, a few photos, their passports and tickets to the Carmel Bach Festival, as they fled their rugged canyon neighborhood.   “What would I grab,” I wondered to myself.  What is most important about my stuff?  What do I value the most?  Where does MY heart really lie?  Does all my stuff keep me from seeing and responding to what is most important in the life in front of me?  Our phone call brought me new eyes and new questions to this text. \\n\\tIn response to the out of the blue request to adjudicate a family dispute about inheritance of stuff, property, money, Jesus tells a short parable.  Known as the story of the “rich fool,” this teaching story begins by describing a successful person who seems quite prudent and not foolish at all.  His land produces an over-abundance of crops and he carefully finds a way to store it and reap the benefits.   Paradigm of a self-made man, enjoying the well-earned fruits of his labors.  These are American ideas!  But there’s a catch:  before he can enjoy much of this, the man dies.  “This very night your life is being demanded of you,” says God in the tale.  What?  An accounting?  What’s it mean that at some point our life will be demanded of us?  There is no talk of final destination, heaven or hell, here.  Yet, something about his encountering God in death is linked with all that the man has prepared, has gained, has focused on as his treasure.  But where did the guy go wrong?  It’s possible his accumulated wealth entailed the exploitation of workers, the reduction of of resources for others in the community.   What we do hear in the story is that he gives no consideration to sharing what he has with others and only stores it for himself,  He may well be planning to jack up his grain prices during the next famine.    \\n\\tWe read more closely and notice this guy says “I” and “my” a lot!  I’m going to do this, consult only myself, then I will do this with all my stuff.  Not much “we” here, is there?  Then I’m going to sit back and congradulate myself.  Self!  Soul!  You’ve done great; relax and enjoy yourself!   Paragon of virtuous independence!   I’m afraid we tend to love this kind of story.  The rugged individual; self-made man deserving of what he or she manages to accumulate.  And defined by it.  Hard worker….so why does God call him a fool?  Is it because this man imagines he lives in isolation?  Who else had a part in all of his success?  Where did he get his land from?  What color was his skin?  Did he start out in priviledge?  He makes no acknowledgement of participating in an abundance that comes from God through the gift of the earth, the land that his servants till.   He is self-absorbed; he takes no delight in nor gives thanks for God’s graciousness.  He displays no notice of, nor care, for neighbors in need.  No connection, no sense that he is part of the family of God.  \\t\\n\\tThis may be at the core of why wealth is problematic.  It’s not wrong;  it’s just dangerous.  It can make us forget about connectedness and inter-dependence.  As Rev. Barber suggested this last week, there is much that can paralize us from action, and a big part of this is self-interest, our concern for self-preservation.  Our assumption that our belongings, our treasure, can in some way save us.   And we put our heart there.\\n\\tAs I spoke with my friend Deborah, I could hear the concern and sadness in her voice.  But she did not sound afraid.  I sensed a steadiness in her, as she spoke of the many, many people, the connections that she has established over the years as a spiritual leader, as an environmental activist  and community volunteer.  These were now enfolding her.  She spoke of the web of prayer, from people around the world, that surrounded her.  Yes, her simple cabin home admist the redwoods and eucalyptus trees is a treasure to her, but it is clearly not where her heart is.  In the middle of the fearsome, overwhelming power of a seemingly unstoppable forest fire, I hear her faithfulness, her sense of safely in God’s presence.   I give thanks for her witness this week of where our true treasure might be.   I give thanks for Jesus who understood this so perceptively and guides us this day in re-locating our own hearts.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Jeremiah is imprisoned under palace guard, and a word from God comes to him.  It appears that in the chaos, a desperate relative of Jeremiah’s needs to unload some property…?  Perhaps the relative is hoping to get his family out of Jerusalem and head south to Egypt before the impending doom.  “What?” Jeremiah questions God.  Suddenly, this vision is confirmed when his cousin Hanamel arrives, pleading, “buy my field at Anathoth; you’re my relative and have first right of refusal here.”  \\nWe think we have been seen a depressed real estate market!  Everyone is trying to leave, the Assyrian’s are at the city gates; and this land in the Anathoth neighborhood of Jerusalem is basically worthless!  Has God chosen an unexpected and symbolic act to communicate with the people in crisis?\\nJeremiah carefully proceeds with the seemingly unwise purchase, signs the deed, obtains the witnesses, weights the money on the scale.  He even has his personal scribe, Barauch, witness everything, and has Barauch place the sealed deeds of purchase “in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.”   In the midst of the chaos, God is directing Jeremiah to look forward.  Jeremiah’s symbolic action reminds the people that God promises, in the middle of the uncertainty and pending dislocation, that “houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.”  Houses, fields, vineyards…when everything is disintegrating around them, God lifts up the future hope of all that makes life possible, stable and fruitful in their culture.  God promises that there will be resources and calm to once again dwell in the land of their ancestors.    \\nThis is the stuff of “hanging in there,” of continuing to lean into God’s promises when things look truly bleak.  What’s the next act look like for us?  We can probably each recall a disappointments and maybe even a disaster that made us want to just fold up shop.  Why keep investing in a relationship when there has been such disappointment?  How do we keep running this business as returns dwindle?  Why keep investing in a particular congregation where there has been betrayal and conflict?  Does “having hope in the future” just look impractical and unwise?     \\nI was reminded this week of another narrative, the story of the Lutheran Theologian and Pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was arrested and killed by the Nazis for allegedly plotting with others to assassinate Adolf Hitler.  A few months before he was imprisoned, he wrote these words about how we must keep investing in the future, even in desperate times:  \"...There remains for us only the very narrow way, often extremely difficult to find, of living every day as if it were our last, and yet living in faith and responsibility as though there were to be a great future. It is not easy to be brave and keep that spirit alive, but it is imperative.\" \\nBonhoeffer reflects on this story from Jeremiah, as he later corresponded with his fiancée Maria von Wedemeyer, from his prison cell.  He writes to her: \"When Jeremiah said, in his people\\'s hour of direst need, that \\'houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land\\', it was a token of confidence in the future. Our (own plans for) marriage must be a \\'yes\\' to God\\'s earth. It must strengthen our resolve to do and accomplish something on earth.\"  \\nThere are different perspectives on just what “confidence in the future” may be.  Some would say this is about rewards in heaven.  And it is a common misperception that today’s text from the Gospel of Luke, is a cautionary tale about our future in the afterlife.  If we are rich and greedy, and ignore the poor, we will go to some place of punishment, and if we are poor, we will go to some kind of heaven in the bosom of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham.   I don’t think this was Jesus point in telling this story.  His challenge in not unlike Bonhoeffer’s:  our confidence, our hope, in God’s good future is about strengthening our resolve to participate in the good in this life.  How might we bring hope to someone in need, someone who crosses our paths while we are living? Jesus asks his listeners.    \\n        Everyday the rich man had a chance to be that hope to the poor man reduced to begging at his gate.  But the man with the resources lived in a culture that conditioned him to ignore Lazarus sitting at his front door, because Lazarus would be considered ritually “unclean” with his open skin lesions and his constant contact with ritually “unclean” dogs. So often we talk sadly about “the poor” or the “disadvantaged.”  And sometimes we generalize about these people, making hopeless assumptions about their motivation or morals.  We generalize about a lot of people, actually:  “those teenagers,” “the elderly,” “those Muslims,” “that bad neighborhood,” “the druggies,” “those people who were against the pastor.”  Our generalizing carries a sense of futility: why interact with or help these groups?  We can lose track of the individuals, each with a separate personhood and unique need.  Empathy disappears.  We lose track of our call to carry the hope of God’s good future to others. \\nI think of the ways this congregation has brought its collective confidence in a good future to the table, year after year.  Putting on a community-wide Thanksgiving dinner, for one thing, and the willingness to do this huge event again this November, even in the midst of reduced person-power at our church.  We choose to reaffirm that this sign of extravagant hospitality, a meal served free to anyone, reflects our values as a congregation. We become like those earthenware vessels that held the deeds for land that seemed valueless at the time.  A church becomes a “holding place” as we listen to people’s stories and respond to their needs.  What others ways might we become become a vessel of hope for people who feel valueless and hopeless?.  We’re beginning to explore how we, a small church in an area of relatively few immigrants, might better understand and address the challenges of immigrants throughout Minnesota, as well as at our southern borders.  This is us participating in the next “act” of God healing the world.\\nIn Jesus’ parable, the rich man is punished at death not because he was rich and greedy.  It’s because he just didn’t see; he averted his eyes and didn’t pay attention to the person right at his door.  Who will we finally “see” this week, that we really didn’t notice before?  It could be on the news or something we read.  Where might we see and affirm value, where the rest of the world sees nothing?  We write the next act in the Biblical narrative with our very lives.  Thanks be to God that these people will cross our paths, so we may become vessels of hope.   Amen.\\n\\t  \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\t  \\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tA lot of people grow up with the Bible as a book of do’s and don’t’s; like\\na rule book.  “Do this, don’t do that.”  “You must always….you must never.” \\nThis is unfortunate.  With this limited perspective of scripture, we can loose\\nourselves in debates about individualistic morality.  We can miss the wider perspective of perennial wisdom offered in these ancient texts.  Not unlike other religious traditions around the world, I believe the Bible has the potential to open us to “a Divine Reality underneath and inherent in the world of things.”  As Richard Rohr, contemporary Franciscan and spiritual teacher describes this common thread in all perennial wisdom traditions, there is the understanding that \\n\\t\\tThere is in “the human soul (has) a natural capacity, similarity, and longing for this Divine Reality, and\\n\\t\\tThe final goal of existence is union with this Divine Reality.\\u2028”  (Rohr’s Center website)  \\nBut if the Jewish and Christian scriptures are just a rule book, one may be left wondering if God isn’t  just a big scorekeeper in the sky.  God peers skeptically down over his glasses at us, weighing our actions and passing judgment on our essential worthiness.   God like the vice principal in my middle school, an angry and impatient man who couldn’t wait to slather butch wax on guys whose hair he deemed too long, all the while publically shaming girls with loud harangues about the length of their skirt hems.  If, as a thinking adult, one is able to once finally jettison that view of God….the perverbial baby often goes out with the bathwater.  Whoever God is, we can’t quite figure out rationally how God might be interacting with the world.  God becomes a distant prime mover, a vague spirit-of-something, only marginally involved with the created order.   \\n\\tBut Jesus of Nazareth seemed to have something else in mind when it came to describing God’s nature, even God’s heart and intentions.   We can see it in the things Jesus said to people, in the way he talked with them about their inherent goodness and interacted among them in both a compassionate and challenging manner.  In the way he kept insisting that the Kingdom of God, God’s realm of justice and peace, was essentialy within them.  In today’s passage from the New Testament Gospel of Matthew, we hear Jesus speaking with the crowds during his Sermon on the Mount.  “You are the salt of the earth!” he announces to those gathered around him.  “You are the light of the world!”   “This is who you are.” \\n\\tHis audience, first century Jews, would have immediately heard the insider language here.  We’ve been exploring the image of light in these last few weeks of the Epiphany season; how the ancient Jewish prophets repeatedly reminded people of God’s call to be a light to the world, a beacon of justice and mercy that is so compelling to the other nations that it draws them into an awareness of God’s presence and power.  Here the call to be “salt” is added to Jesus’ challenge.  Salt has served as a ceremonial element in religions around the world, and the ancient Middle East was no exception.  This precious mineral substance had already been mined, produced, tracked for thousands of years by this point.  Besides seasoning and preserving food, salt was ritually used weddings, housewarmings, warding off evil spirits, and legaling sealing certain agreements.  According to Mark Kurlansky’s book Salt: A World History, by Jesus’ time, the human demand for salt had already formed special trade routes, was used as a ceremonial sign of Israel’s covenant with God, was sprinkled on burnt offerings made in the Temple in Jerusalem, and was a commodity controlled and taxed by the occupying Roman Empire.  Even today, Jewish families will dip their Sabbath bread in salt to affirm their on-going covenant with God.  Jesus wasn’t just telling his listeners to become like salt or to become like light and a light to the nations.  Here Jesus used the words: “you ARE.”  You are salt of the earth.  You are the light of the world.  It’s as if he is saying: this is who you are, O Israel, now BE that.  \\n\\tA word of caution, however.  This salt image can lead us into the “do this, do that” trap again.  “Oh, but we might loose our flavor,” I think to myself, worrying about how “I must try and stay salty.”  But I learned this week that it is impossible for the actual chemical of salt to ever get “unsalty.”  It can get mixed up with soil or other impurities or it can melt away and disappear.  But if salt exists, it IS salty.  And Jesus said:  You ARE salt.   And when there is salt, it is salty.  I can almost see Jesus slyly smiling as he says this, almost to imply that we can’t NOT be salt.  Just as we are God’s beloved, we are the salt of the earth.  Here to bring all kinds of enhancement and added taste to life around us.  Here to help preserve life, like salt has been used for ages, all over the world, to preserve vegetables and meats.   Jesus isn’t commanding people to try harder at this; it’s almost like a call to a different self-awareness, a change in consciousness.  Jesus is inviting them to see themselves differently, to take it in, ingest this reality.  Be yourself, he urges them!  Pour yourself out.   Salt, light…parts of the material world that are essential to life….come on, he urges, pour yourself out!\\n\\tBut what makes this “outpouring” happen besides just trying harder to be helpful and nice?  The passage from I Corinthians 2:1-13 can be off-putting, I admit, but it may contain some clues for us.  Admittedly, this is the apostle Paul at some of his more convoluted letter-writing.  He is addressing this church in Corinth where there has been much faithfulness, good work….. and considerable conflict.  He’s doing pastoral trouble-shooting in this letter, based on some feedback he has received from some of the members.  Several weeks ago we read of how he challenged the congregation to stop bickering and join in a unity of mind and purpose.  In today’s portion, he tells them how to get there.  Or how to realize they are there, already.  Paul writes how he decided to “know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.”  He speaks of this in other letters, to other young churches, “preaching only Christ crucified.”  These words can male progressive, even mainline, Christians a tad nervous… especially if it is followed up with allusions to sin being washed in the blood or some other form of blood-price crucifixion theory.  As if this crucifixion talk wasn’t off-putting enough, Paul goes on to contrast human wisdom and God’s wisdom in a way that can almost seem anti-intellectual.  Oh Paul, I find myself complaining, why did you have to make Jesus’ teachings so complicated and off-putting?    \\nI believe Paul is trying to tell us something about God that Jesus knew inherently.  Paul doesn’t say, “I came to preach Jesus Christ triumphant” or even “Jesus resurrected.”  He says:  “I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words of wisdom” (classical Greek rehetoric).  “I decided to know nothing amoung you expect Christ crucified.”  Is he suggesting that there might be a different way of being in the world….that perhaps God’s power comes to us most clearly in vulnerability, in weakness….not in strength, competitiveness or defensiveness?   Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek, we read in Jesus’ words last week.  “The Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God,” Paul continues in his letter.  “Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.”  Gifts bestowed on us….”you are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world.”  But how do we know this, we ask?  Our very consciousness has changed: and here it is several lines later in verse 16: “we have the mind of Christ.”   \\nCynthia Bourgeault, Episcopal priest, author and contemporary mystic has written this about the “mind of Christ” in her book, Wisdom Jesus:  Paul’s words “call us up short as to what we are actually supposed to be doing on this path (as followers of Jesus): (we are not to be) just admiring Jesus, but acquiring his consciousness….” Seeing with his eyes, learning to respond to the world with that same wholeness and healing love.  Through the practice of prayer and meditation, through soaking in scripture, we are literally taking on the mind of Jesus Christ.  The Spirit thinking with and through us.  Pouring ourselves out as Jesus did, who constantly self-emptied in love, all the way to being crucified.  We are called to that same kind of self-emptying in love, pouring out ourselves as salt and light to the world.   \\nWe might do well to notice the ways we are already salt and light for others, because I’ll bet all of us are.  One of my clergy collegues recently challenged his congregation to keep track for week of all the times they added some flavor or enhancement to someone else’s life.  Keep a salt log, he suggested.  Observe your salty spirit in action;  and perhaps catch others in their acts of “saltiness.”  Keep track of each time someone else adds some enhancement or helps preserve your life. Keep a “salt log” so you can remember who you are:  You are the salt of the earth, says Jesus.\\nAs we watch for ourselves being salt and light, we learn about how God sees us; we come to know our own belovedness as God’s children, as disciples of Jesus.  As this inner “mind of Christ” slowly transforms us, our lives bring into focus the new creation that God is revealing through the Spirit.  We are the salt of the earth; we are the light of the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tA big part of an interim period between settled pastors is re-imagining “what are we doing here?”  What’s the “why” behind being here at church in worship on a Sunday morning, when you could be communing with God in nature, mowing the lawn, reading the paper, sleeping in, getting a jump on your workweek, or having a family brunch together?   Today’s portion of the United Church of Christ Statement of Faith pulls us into the thick of this question, in this era when the institution of the church is rapidly changing.   You might notice that the two scripture passages that were just read do not even mention the word “church.”  This is not a word you hear coming out of Jesus’ mouth, as he stays focused on calling people to discipleship, a radical way of being in the world.  “Spread the message and cast out demons….get on with it,” he tells his inner circle of followers.  Spread the message about what?  Cast out what?   \\n\\n\\tThe piece from the early missionary Paul’s letter to the church in Corinth doesn’t talk about “church” in this instance either.  Instead, Paul rattles on about how they no longer regard other people from a “human point of view,” but now as being new creatures in Christ.  They are to be part of a “ministry of reconciliation.”   Messaging, casting out evil, reconciling.   But wait, what about the August food drive and the stewardship campaign and fall clean-up day and youth group mission projects and choir rehearsal and the September newsletter?   What is church to be about in the 21st century?\\n\\n\\tOne of you handed me a local newspaper clipping during after-worship coffee hour last Sunday, that has me wondering about the purpose of church.  I looked down and read the by-line: “Want sustained happiness?  Try religion” – a copy of a recent Washington Post article by Sarah Pulliam Bailey. When I first started hearing “happiness studies” and “positive psychology” research a decade or more ago, I felt a bit irritated.  As Christian, is it my life goal to be happy?  Jesus spoke about coming so that people could have “abundant life.”  I don’t think God particularly likes it when I am suffering, but is happiness God’s goal for me?  Was it Jesus’ goal to be happy himself or make other people happy?  While I have appreciated how much of this happiness research has identified particularly actions we can take in our lives to be more joy-filled, instead of just passively waiting for circumstances to make us happy, something always irked me a bit about the whole venture. \\n\\n\\tSince we are looking at the part of the UCC Statement of Faith that talks about the church this week, this particular newspaper clip about church involvement re-engaged me in this whole happiness debate.  How does this idea of “going to church to be more happy” resonate with what our Statement of Faith actually says about being “called into the church?”  The article described recent research by the London School of Economics and the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands.  Researchers considered four areas of social participation that can lead to “sustained happiness.”  Volunteering with a charity; taking educational classes; participating in a religious organization; participating in a political or community organization.  Conclusion?  “The secret to sustained happiness lies in participation in religion.”  It didn’t specify which religion, or what “participation” might look like.  Important to note also that this was a study of 9000 Europeans over the age of 50.  How might the results be different for the 20-40 somethings among us?  For teenagers?  Also interesting was the researchers’ finding that “benefits could be outweighed by other negative impacts of volunteering, such as stress.”   Don’t we know it!   Sadly enough, participating and volunteering in the life of a church can be stressful, it can be hurtful, it can challenge rather than support your sense of connection with God.  You have experienced this in this congregation, and we continue to be faced with unresolved hurts, resentments, frustrations, and lack of accountability….not just in recent events but going back decades.  This is not unusual in congregations, but we are finding it is problematic to this church moving forward into the future God plans for you.  \\n\\n\\tOne final piece from this European research.  The newspaper article concludes that “researchers noted that it is unclear whether the benefits of participating in a religious organization are connected to being in the religious community, or to the faith itself.”   These two aspects of being the church are closely intertwined: being part of a congregation and experiencing/believing/trusting the faith.  But the researchers are on to something, and that distinction between the two might help us as we consider this fourth portion of the UCC Statement of Faith today about the church.  \\n\\n\\tLet’s read this portion about the church together, as it is printed on the front page of your service bulletin. As I have for the last several Sunday, I urge you again to join in even if you are uncertain as to whether or not you actually agree with every piece of this.  Hear yourself voice it; listen to the voices around you; try it on:\\nYou call us into your church\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to accept the cost and joy of discipleship,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to be your servants in the service of others,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to proclaim the gospel to all the world\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0and resist the powers of evil,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to share in Christ's baptism and eat at his table,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to join him in his passion and victory.\\n\\n\\tLike the rest of the Statement, each section testifies to the deeds of God:  from calling the world into being, to Jesus Christ sharing our common lot and conquering sin and death, to bestowing the Holy Spirit upon us.  In this section, God is described as calling us.  Calling us into something, the church, in order to…..in order for us to do some things.  This is the section where we become deed-doers.  Where we become partners with this God, Eternal Spirit.  \\n\\n\\tAnthony Robinson, the UCC minister and author who works with congregations in times of transition, has written about a shift in our deed-doing in church.  In What Theology Got to Do with It, he describes how “the central challenge facing many congregations today is to shift their dominate paradigm from being cultures of membership to cultures of discipleship.”  Churches have come to reflect a wider culture that encourages us to be consumers of goods and services.  Church decisions are driven by individual preferences, and for some people, if they don’t like what’s going on, they withhold giving or simply disappear.  Robinson states that the point of church is not membership, but discipleship.  “The church exists to form and sustain individuals and a people who are followers of Jesus Christ…the church does more than meets customers needs…the church redefines our true needs…the church transforms people according to the life and pattern revealed by God in Jesus Christ and unites them with others who are committed to this way of life.” (p. 162-163).   Perhaps church is supposed to be a place where we makes mistakes, hurt one another, and are uniquely encouraged and supported in the forgiveness and reconciliation process.  Could church be a safe place where we could learn to do this?  Not silencing the hurts and frustrations and making nice to one another, but bravely and compassionately engaging in a ministry of reconciliation?  Could this lead to true happiness?\\n\\n\\tMy hunch is that the happiness, not just a fleeting feeling but a sense of contentment and fulfillment, is not just about membership in a like-minded, polite religious group.  Our statement speaks of discipleship entailing both the “cost and joy” as we do things that will change us.  Serving others, not just helping people because they need it, but because we need to do it; we are transformed in the serving.  Speaking truth to power, daring to name and resist the powers of evil in our day that invariably will seem “political” because it has to do with life in the polis, in community.  Our choices and actions in the world affect the whole of our being together as the wider community; it’s all political!  And this discipleship changes us to speak up and work for justice.  Coming together to share at the baptismal font and around Christ’s table.  Reconciling with one another so we can do that coming together with integrity and hope. Because it transforms us into more whole and joy-filled people.\\n\\n\\tI find this to be the most challenging section of the Statement of Faith.  It pushes me, holds be accountable.  It has the potential to stir deep happiness and satisfaction within us.  What does it stir in you?  Let’s begin talking together about why God calls us into the church.  Join me after worship in the sofa area of the Gathering Room, and let’s keep talking into the Fall.  What do you each believe about what it means to be “church?”  Amen.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\tThy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  Let’s consider what we are asking for when we pray this part of the Lord’s Prayer.  As the saying goes, different people really do approach life differently:  Some see life, events around them, as a “half-empty glass” and some see it  “half-full.” I wonder how life seems to you this morning?  As you take a broad view, beyond your own daily encounters, do things seem to be getting better or are things getting worse in human history?  This question hasn’t just perplexed our contemporary world. Ancient Greek and later Roman philosophers contributed to the half-empty/half-full debate:  world getting worse, getting better?   According to Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan (The Greatest Prayer: Rediscovering the Revolutionary Message of the Lord’s Prayer), beginning about the mid-second century before Jesus birth, Biblical writers came up with a unique version of “glass half empty or half full.”  They started claiming that the “glass” of human history was actually “cracked” and desperately in need of repair (p. 74).  Something about God’s plan for the world had gone seriously awry.  Their people were repeatedly under siege or conquered, and in times of peace and self-rule, justice and mercy no longer prevailed their own land.  \\n\\n\\tAround this time, the Book of Daniel spoke to this need for “world repair.”  The book is filled with dreams and visions describing the four preceding empires that had decimated the Jewish people.  Depicted as wild beasts, these empires were symbolically portrayed as horrendous creatures rising “up out of the sea” the ancient mythological origin of watery chaos.  The original audiences for this story would have laughed at the way some 21st century Christians take this imagery literally.  They knew this was powerful poetic language that personified these seemingly permanent, imperial regimes as bizarre, bloodthirsty and dangerous wild animals.  Babylonians who carted the population off into exile, destroying the Temple and Jerusalem.  Medes who conquered the Jews upon their return to Palestine, followed by the marauding Persians.  And finally Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Greek who were so innovatively brutal with their new-fangled weaponry and war tactics, that Daniel only calls this beast as hellishly “different” – iron teeth, claws of bronze, trampling, breaking into pieces, devouring the whole earth.  (And we give this Bible to children?).\\n\\tAccording to Crossan, the author of Daniel is one of the first to articulate this idea that God planned an everlasting kingdom that would be vastly different\\nfrom these beastly, inhuman and temporary kingdoms: “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.”  This was to be a fifth kingdom, not time-limited, but everlasting. God’s kingdom or reign was to be personified not by beasts but by a person, the “son of man.”  Or, as Crossan describes: “a transcendental Human one who has been entrusted with (the Kingdom) by God, the transcendent Ancient One.”   The kingdom will be given to this “son of man” for the benefit of all humans.  This is the start of the vision of tikkun olam, the Hebrew words for “healing the world” and the Jewish vision of a Messiah who would usher in this reign.  And eventually Jesus will use this title, “son of man,” “son of the human one,” to describe his own ministry and purpose.\\n\\n\\tWhen we move to Jesus’ time, Israel is under the thumb of a “beast” of proportions that Daniel never could have imagined: the Roman Empire.  It is both Daniel’s visions and this new Roman imperialist rule that are the context for Jesus’ self-understanding and the Lord’s Prayer.  Our current and treasured divisions between politics and religion are frankly too simplistic to understand their world.  Politics and religion were all intertwined.  Nor do these contemporary distinctions help us imagine how Jesus envisioned the cracks in the glass being mended, the world being healed.  For Jesus, God’s kingdom wasn’t a place (like up in heaven), it was more a verb.  God reigns in a different manner than corrupt human rulers.  \\n\\n\\tBut what would this look like?  Last week we explored the opening parts of the Lord’s Prayer, our Father/abba, intimate papa, who art in heaven/in the whole universe, hallowed be thy name.   Consider the idea of God being like the head of a large household, the parental leader over a large, multigenerational estate.   John Dominic Crossan suggests that Jesus understood God to be the head Householder, taking loving and just care of everyone, in a worldwide “household” where there was peace and everyone was to have enough. The frail and vulnerable, and the needy were to get special attention.  So Jesus taught his followers to pray like this: May your kingdom come and your will be done, here on earth as it is in heaven. \\n\\nWhat are we asking for when we say to God “thy kingdom come, thy will be done?”  This kingdom language may seem a bit strange for us in this country.  Our nation’s founders were very much opposed to any kind of monarchy or absolute rule of a king or queen.  We live in and celebrate our participatory democracy.   The Hebrew people in Old Testament times did not have a very good experience of kings and kingdoms either.  These were independent tribal clans, constantly on the move with their flocks and families. Years later, after the Jews fled Pharaoh’s oppressive reign in Egypt, they were not too keen on a king with absolute power.  They built a community based on their covenant with God:  known most intimately with the giving of the Law on Sinai.  They understood God to be their leader, and this would distinguish them from other surrounding nations and empires of their day. And within that covenant agreement with this ruling God, the people agreed to follow God’s laws, which taught an unusual sharing of power and resources among the people. \\n\\n\\tWhile Israel sometimes ignored these laws, the intent was for as little disparity as possible between the rich and the poor.  Given the current debate about income inequality in our nation, particularly as to how this divides along racial lines, we might want to pay particular attention to where Jesus is going with this.  The intent of Jewish law was that there be some kind of equity among everyone.  Digging through the remains of these ancient communities archaeologists have discovered that their houses, up until the time of the monarchy period, were pretty much the same modest size.  But after the monarchy period starts in 1020 BCE with King Saul, archaeologists have found an increasing array of palatial dwellings (McMansions of the day) and as well as hovels (p. 10, Crossan). Eventually later prophets start proclaiming that now Israel looks much like all the other foreign powers through history…power hungry, vast economic disparity among the people, not caring for the poor and marginalized in their midst.  I find there is something chillingly familiar and relevant about this critique. \\n\\n\\tJesus was picking up on the prophets’ call for a return to God’s reign, style of ruling, with equity for all. Jesus was not just talking about some interior moral kingdom in our hearts; and this is were we get distracted in our life together as Christians.  Paradoxically, he taught that “the KOG is within you,” an animating force already inside of us.  But he also described a world around us in which fairness and justice for everyone must rule.  And this world would come about not with violence, like the imperial beasts of Daniel’s time or Rome’s military might.  Its power would come through non-violence and mutual compassion.  Jesus gets into trouble and is eventually executed, because his preaching is a direct challenge to all kinds of domination systems of his day: systems like the violent, repressive rule of the Roman Empire.  And, systems of privilege and prestige within his own religious tradition. \\n\\n\\tWhy pray for God’s will to be done?  Some Christians will talk about “God’s will for your life” like it is a pre-set blueprint.  And it sounds harsh, judgmental, and probably not much fun.  We reduce “God’s will” to individual morality, or expand it far enough to say it is “God’s will” that a certain sports event, battle or war has been won for our side.  But it is God’s will that the world be healed.  In fact, according to Crossan’s research, the word “will” here actually means, “good will or good pleasure.” It is God’s good pleasure, God’s wish or deep yearning, for us to be living differently: in harmony, in fairness and peace.  That is God’s will. \\n\\n\\tThe Kingdom of God, God’s will done among God’s people on earth….it is happening and it is not fully happening yet.  So pray for it, says Jesus.  Pray for it with all your heart.   But look out!  Part of Jesus’ uniqueness was introducing this different paradigm through which to understand God:  God doesn’t swoop in and intervene.  God calls us to collaborate with God, partner with God’s good pleasure.  And this partnering is going to change us.  Jesus invites us to pray ourselves into this transformation of the world and ourselves.\\n\\n\\tHow does this work?  We pray it and then we watch for the opportunities to partner with God.  And they will pop up.  “Kingdom come/will be done” – use this as a breath prayer through the routine of your day….waiting for the elevator or while you’re on hold on the phone, while chopping carrots, pumping gas, sitting in a meeting at work.  Then watch for the invitation to collaborate with God’s leveling, healing forces as God heals the world.  What will it be?  Will we speak up when a word of truth is needed?   Will we read the news differently, vote differently?  Will we stop complaining about something and find a solution?  Will we spend our money in different ways?  Will we finally forgive someone this week that has really hurt us?  We dare not pray this part of the prayer unless we are willing to be changed, transformed into kingdom-bearers, partners in God’s reign.  Amen.',\n",
       " '“Peace to this house” and “the Kingdom of God has come near to you.”  These seem like rather mild statements to say, but apparently not.  Something about “Peace to this house” and the “Kingdom of God has come near to you” can be offensive, even radically incendiary, to people.  Why is that?  What would trigger people to say “no way” to such seemingly innocuous statements?\\n\\tIn the New Testament, the phrase “Kingdom of God,” is sometimes translated “kingdom of heaven:”  Jesus used these words a lot and the concept itself was nothing new.  Language about the “kingdom” or “reign” of God went way back in the Jewish tradition and drew on the metaphor of a monarchy, with God as the supreme, just and compassionate (and male) King.  It referred a realm of peace and justice under God’s rule of mercy, an earthly utopia.  A time and place “where human beings lived together in harmony and fair distribution of economic assets.” Everyone would have enough (Bourgeault, Wisdom Jesus, p. 30).  Throughout their history, the Jewish “prophets and visionaries labored to bring into being their respective versions of this kind of Kingdom of Heaven.”  “On earth as it is in heaven,” Jesus would later teach.  They all believed this was God’s intent for humans since the beginning of time.  “But somehow these earthly utopias never seemed to stay put for very long.”  Human desires for security and survival, esteem and control, would usually prevail; conflict would rage.  Peace and justice would wax and wane, depending upon who was in power.\\nBut notice that in Luke’s narrative, Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God.  This Kindgom is not being described as a locality, or, as many would later assume, a place we might arrive after we die.  At several points, Jesus talks about “seeing” the Kingdom of God, or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, a reign of interdependence, compassion and justice among us.  What is different about Jesus, is that he speaks as this reality is already here, all around and even within us.  “When his followers wanted to proclaim him the Messiah, the divinely anointed king of Israel who would inaugurate this reign of God’s justice upon the earth, Jesus shrank from all that and said, strongly and unequivocally, ‘ My kingdom is not of this world.’” (Bourgeault p. 30).  \\nThe Gospel of John tells a story of a conversation Jesus had with one of the Jewish legal scholars and teachers, Nichodemus.  Jesus insisted that “no one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew.” It’s as if Jesus was saying, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must begin again, re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  You have to see differently.  All this sounds rather ambiguous.  But great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us!  Paul will later write to the church in Ephesus that they should seek to have  “the eyes of their hearts enlighted…”  Like putting on a different set of lens.  Seeing the world, each other, as God sees us.  Equal, precious, beloved.  I want a pair of these lens!  \\nContemplative writers through the years have claimed that perhaps the Kingdom of God is an interior place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Perhaps Jesus was describing a “whole new way of looking at the world, a transformed awareness that literally turns this world into a different place.” (p. 30).  If that sounds weird, let’s see if we can imagine it:  A transformed awareness that melts the differences “between Muslims and Christians, between Republicans and Democrats or even between between God and humans”. Cynthia Bourgeault, a contemporary Episcopal author and mystic, suggests it is as though Jesus is inviting us to step into another dimension that is there, welcoming us already.” (The contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault  Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind.  p. 30.)   \\nIn my experience, I have to practice this way of seeing because it doesn’t come naturally.  My brain wants to make distinctions between things.  I have to practice not seeing separation.  I have to practice looking through a lens of Oneness.  Such as, gazing at a specific tree and not seeing a separate entity but a conjoined member of a vast network of trees, connected below the surface, beyond my vision, intertwined in a sprawling network of roots that communicate minerals and hydration and even messages to one another.  Or, contemplating the person passing me on the street and imagining the generations of humans that came before him, the mother that birthed him.  Imagining the myriad of experiences that may have brought a cranky or problematic person to this moment.  Staring up at the night sky and picturing all the distant rays of light that have traveled eons just to hit my eyes in that moment, pondering how the past and present interweave in what I am seeing.  Or dealing with someone who is driving me to distraction and seeing that person as a beloved child of God, worthy of both my compassion and being held accountable for their actions.  If I don’t work on contemplating interconnection, Oneness, I spend much of my day only making distinctions: is this person for or against the church.  Are North Koreans or immigrants crowding our borders evil or good, will such-and-such a person be a pain-in-the-neck today or be nice, will someone like me or not.  Binary thinking it’s called, the system installed in our brains that enables us to is make distinctions between things, to make rational judgements that direct our actions. It’s a helpful way to think…..sometimes.  Little kids learn this early: is it a dog or a cat? An ear or a nose?  We need our brains to think this way for a number of questions:  Time to change the oil in my car or not?  Is the banana ripe or not ripe? We perceive things through seeing the differences between them.  Which can quickly move on to judgements about good/bad, included/excluded, right/wrong.  Our identity gets caught up in the process:  I am this, but not that.  As though I were a static “thing” separate from all I are experiencing.  And as a separate self, we worry about protecting and defending ourselves, we worry about scarcity and feeling powerless.  I think part of why Jesus’ words, “the Kingdom of God has come near to you,” was so unsettling to people is that he was signaling that their identity and their perceptions were often…..well, a mirage.  An illusion.  We see only separateness, we define everything out of our own experience.  We miss the oneness that all great wisdom teachers of various spiritual traditions are pointing to.   Love your neighbor as yourself,” Jesus would teach. Could it be that we are the neighbor ourselves?  Bear one another’s burdens, Paul writes to the church at Galatia.  Why?  Because the human burdens are all one….they are meant to be shared.\\n\\t\\xa0What is Jesus asking his listeners to see, to give their heart to, to trust in? \\xa0  For starters, a shift in consciousness, a deeper living that comes from seeing through the lens of God’s reign. Out of this fuller connection with all that is in this moment, a empathy and understanding for other humans grows.  Our awareness of our place within creation evolves.  And we will naturally desire to care for all of it.  We will seek to bear one another’s and our planet’s burdens with humility and joy.  So may it be.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tChristmas presents!  When I was a little girl, I made long lists of toys that I hoped Santa would bring.  As I got older, I loved making presents for my parents, like clunky clay ashtrays that we made in school for all of our parents who all smoked back then!  My sister and I would make coupon books for breakfast in bed or folding laundry or mowing the lawn.  I never thought much about why we all gave and received presents at Christmas.  Baby Jesus got some presents from the wisemen, the magi who followed a star to come visit him, so why shouldn’t we!  \\n\\tBut I later learned that gift-giving at this time of year was an ancient tradition in the Mediterraen world where Jesus was born.   There was something about the darkest time of year that inspired people to give each other presents.  The longest night….followed by days of growing light and length.  \\n\\tAround the time of Jesus’ birth, the Romans were already celebrating Saturnalia.  Feast time of 7 days when people would give each other little gifts like wax candles or fruit and nuts or a little lantern, a tiny doll or animal made of dough.  Wishing each other more light and good fortune in the year to come.   \\n\\n\\tIt wasn’t until the 4th century that the early church chose a day during this festival and winter solstice traditions to remember the birth of Jesus.  December 25.  Reminding Christians of the wisemen bringing gifts to Jesus.  Reminding us of God giving us the gift of Jesus.  \\n\\tSo, giving gifts is an old custom.  But the art of giving and receiving is actually quite difficult, when you think about it.  Sometimes it’s hard to give someone something:  when we choose a gift, we are saying “this is what I like you are like…and you might like this!”  It’s risky!  \\n\\tAnd it can be hard to receive.  When we become grown-ups sometimes a challenge to say out loud what we really want.  Do I really want more slippers, or would I like you to call me more often, come visit me, forgive me, understand me better? \\n\\n\\tStories help us understand difficult things like gift-giving.  I share with you a tale by the American short-story writer, O. Henry:  \\n\\n\\tOnce upon a time, about a hundred years ago, there was a young couple who did not have much money.  The wife Della had been saving up her penny’s, carefully skimping on groceries, but careful not to let her husband Jim notice.  The day before Christmas she counted out $1.87.  That’s all she had.  She had so much wanted to buy a gold watch chain for her husband.  He carried this watch in his pocket, as he didn’t have a chain to connect it to, like other men.  It had been his father’s and his grandfather’s and he would often pull in out to look at it fondly.  \\n\\tShe stared at her reflection in the mirror.  On top of her head was a pile of richly colored dark brown hair, styled as was the custom of the day.  All of a sudden she took out her hairpins and let her hair fall around her shoulders and down her back to her knees!  Jim loved her beautiful long hair.  Tears came to her eyes, she quickly arranged her hair back up on her head, grabbed her coat and ran out the door.  Down the street to Madame Sofronie’s hair salon where she sold her long hair for $20.  \\n\\tHair now in a short, curly bob, she headed off to the local jewlers and bought the watch chain for Jim’s watch.  And hurried home to make Christmas eve dinner.\\n\\n\\tAt 7:00, Jim returned home from work.  Della heard him on the stairs and hoped that he would still think she was pretty with her now-short hair.  He opens the door, ready to greet her and stops dead.  Stands there stunned.  \\n\\tOh Jim, Della cries, don’t be sad! \\n\\tYou cut off your hair? he asked in a daze? \\n\\t I did it for your Christmas present.  It will grow back!  He sits down and told her to come close.  Pulls package from his pocket.  Merry Christmas Della.  She tears open the simple wrapping and Inside were a pair of expensive tortoise shell hair combs, the ones she had admired in the store window, to hold up her beautiful long hair.   Streiking with joy she picks up the shiny combs, sparkling with little jewels. \\tThen she remembers: her hair was sold!   Tears fill her eyes!  She sniffs, straightens up and says but my hair will grow back!  Now, let me get you my gift!\\n\\nShe jumps up and gets the flashing platinum watch chain – holding it out to him in her hand.  Isn’t it a dandy?  You’ll have it forever!  Here, give me you watch, and we’ll fastened in on!\\n\\nBut Jim just sits back on the couch and smiles.  I think we need to just put back our Christmas presents and keep them for awhile.  You see, I sold my watch today so I could buy you these hair combs.  Shall we see to supper, then?\\n\\nI suppose sometimes gifts of great love can seem foolish.   We may not see ourselves as wise people.  Yet, created in the image of God, the Original Great Giver, we are foolishly bold in our giving.  We give of ourselves, we give of our treasure, we give of our heart and our hopes.  And that is very wise indeed.  Merry Christmas and Amen!\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAnd now, it is Christmas Eve, and we assume the time of preparation is over.  Whew, well, okay.  I’ll do better next year, we promise ourselves.  But, as I imagine the nativity scene, with shepherds bursting in right after Jesus’ birth, I wonder if, really, any one was very prepared.  I picture the shepherds breathlessly repeating to the dazed Mary and Joseph what the angels had told them.  “Good news…great joy!”  I imagine this scruffy, unbathed group of shepherds crowding around the manger scene. “yes, yes, lot’s of angels, all singing! “amazing, incredible, A Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord!”  “Glory to God in the highest…peace on earth to all!”  \\n\\tLuke reports that “all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.”  We are not sure who “all” these people were, perhaps some relatives of Joseph’s, midwifes who had been quickly summoned, people from the nearby inn.  But in the middle of this hub-bub, Luke describes Mary as quietly listening and “treasuring these words” and “pondering (this mystery) in her heart.”  \\n\\tWhat it means to “ponder something in your heart?”  Dame Julian of Norwich, the 14th century abbess, theologian and poet may guide us here.  In one of her prayers, she writes:\\n\\tLord, let not our souls be busy inns\\n\\t\\tThat have no room for thee or thine,\\n\\tBut quiet homes of prayer and praise,\\n\\t\\tWhere thou mayest find fit company,\\n\\tWhere the needful cares of life\\n\\t\\tAre wisely ordered and put away,\\n\\tAnd wide, sweet spaces kept for thee;\\n\\t\\tWhere holy thoughts pass up and down\\n\\tAnd fervent longings watch and wait thy coming.\\n\\tJulian is describing the work of pondering mystery in our hearts.  And it seems to happen only when we do some clearing-out, some quieting.  Pondering: I don’t think we are really used to this kind of mulling-things-over.  It’s different from worrying about something in particular; or anxiously calculating or even generalized nervous imaginings (all those kinds of thinking we do, say, at 3 am when we can’t sleep). \\n\\t“Pondering” has both deeper and lighter quality.   The Greek verb actually means to “converse with” or to “meditate upon” or literally “to throw side by side.”  It’s a searching kind of wondering about a mystery, exploring for the right meaning of some events or ideas, often with the implication of divine help.   Sort of like looking at something with soft, half-closed eyes, blurry vision getting a better view of the total picture.  Pausing before speaking in a conversation.  Fully letting someone finish what they are saying; listening carefully and not planning our response, our retort.  Letting there be enough “wide, sweet space” in our days, to notice the “holy thoughts” passing up and down, to watch for “fervent longings” within ourselves that might guide us towards God’s intentions for us.  It occurs to me that it is this type of “pondering,” this wondering where God is in all these events of life, may actually be our best preparation for the future.\\n\\tI remember how my family tried to prepare for the future, a few years ago now, with my dad’s declining health and the burden his care placed on our mother.  We marveled at Dad’s ability to still enjoy his life-long creative loves of both music and painting, “side by side” with his advancing Alzheimer’s and loss of mobility.  As one of my sisters  and I would talk in those difficult months leading up to his death, we realized both how expectant we were of his dying.  It was clearly coming.  And at the same time we had no idea what it would be like for us when his “light” went out.   I mused that we simply could not prepare for his passing, that it would lead us into another place, another terrain, that we did not yet know.   As she and I talked that last Christmas we shared with him, I told her that all we could do was to be like Mary.  This was a time not to figure things out, but to ponder the great mystery of all this in our hearts and see what God called us to next.\\n\\tI suppose we could say that there are many events and people coming towards each of us, that will affect and change us.  There are probably changes coming towards this congregation at Falcon Heights, ones that we cannot even anticipate at this moment.  “Side by side” with the beloved traditions of this church, there will be unexpected challenges, invitations, revelations even, that will invite this congregation to respond in new ways.   There are events coming towards us as a nation, some of which we can prepare for and some of which we cannot.  That bugs us, doesn’t it?  We brace in fear, and imagine that high walls, and stiffer laws, more armaments and personal firearms, isolating or sending away people who are different from us, we think these things will prepare us.   I imagine we are sadly mistaken.  \\n\\tAs Mary gazed at the miracle of her new infant, this young mother had no idea what was coming towards her.  How could she anticipate what her son’s life would be about?  She couldn’t imagine the wisdom he would speak, the people he would cure, crowds who would follow him, the religious and governmental leaders who would feel threatened by his way with people and his radical teachings.  How could she know he would be arrested and executed on a cross?  How could she know about his resurrection and the wildfire of power and hope that would eventually overcome his dispirited followers, of which she was one?  \\n\\tWe often find ourselves internally bracing against what might happen next;  we struggle for control and hope to plan things just right.  We pray to God for specific outcomes to our problems.  It makes us feel uncomfortable to not be able to predict the future; we believe our ceaseless thinking will eventually fix something.  Mary gives us another way to prepare for what is ahead with her thoughtful pondering.   Perhaps it is a softening of the heart, a receptivity to God’s way with us, that we recognize in the mother of Jesus.   \\n\\tTo be a follower of the Risen Jesus entails much that is unknown.  It leads individual Christians and whole churches on paths they may never have imagined.   For this night, there is much to ponder.  And so we pray, “Lord let not our souls be busy inns that have no room for thee or thine, but quiet homes of prayer and praise.”  As we move out into this holy night, let us keep those “wide, sweet spaces” within, for God’s unfolding revelation in our lives.   “Wide, sweet spaces kept for thee; where holy thoughts pass up and down and fervent longings watch and wait thy coming.”  A blessed Christmas to you all.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOne of the reasons it’s important to be connected with other churches in our wider United Church of Christ denomination, is that it can help us gain some perspective in challenging times.  We can get focused on our own disagreements and feelings, our own site-specific trials and polarization.  For a wider view, I’ve been thinking lately of an unexpected disaster that happened three years ago this month, at church in the San Francisco Bay area.  First Congregational United Church of Christ in Berkeley was a congregation I knew well from my years of ministry in northern California.  For well over a century, this big urban church had been a center of theological liberalism and social justice leadership in the San Francisco Bay area.  Sitting on the edge of the UC Berkeley campus, the congregation was on the forefront of fighting for women’s suffrage, the rights of interned Japanese Americans, civil rights for people of color, nuclear disarmament, and more recently partnering with Black Lives Matters to address continuing racial injustice.  But during one awful October week, several of the church’s buildings were destroyed by a roof construction fire and the main Sanctuary was unusable due to considerable smoke and water damage.  Frustration and grief overwhelmed everyone:  how did this happen?  Who was at fault? Now what?  In the midst of this sudden devastation, their Senior Minister, Molly Phinney Baskette, wrote a pastoral letter to her congregation: “are we paying close attention to the story we are telling about this event?” she asked.  “Do we tell a story about fear and despair, or a story about hope?  Following this terrible fire, will this be a time of hunkering down for us as a church, of restricting programming and staff under the weight of costly repairs?”  She noted that “A few of the TV news channels, which love to light up the lizard brain to spike ratings, told the story of fear and despair: heartbreaking devastation, toddlers from our nonexistent day care fleeing the building, danger of building collapse. They weren’t really interested in our composure.”  “Our public statements about resiliency and strength, about people being more important than things, about vision for the future, didn’t make their newscasts,” Rev. Phinney Baskett continued.  She described how one of their church musicians had “encountered white supremacists demonstrating Friday night near our church, preaching that the fire was an act of God in retribution for our Black Lives Matter banner. They were selling a vengeful God, a border-wall God, the God whose love is scarce and finite….But you,” she writes to her people, “you have been telling the hope story of our fire. You are honoring your grief and your memories, but not letting them get in the way of believing forward that God will do great things among us.” (from MFB Facebook page).\\n\\tI come to our texts this morning, wondering our hope story, about how God will continue to do great things among us.  I wonder about the story being told around town about our congregation: what do you hear?  What do you find yourself saying?  Are these stories of fear, grievance and despair?  “The church will never be the same again….I’m so angry I just can’t be part of it anymore…..I’m so hurt and sad I just can’t engage with those people.”  Or are we telling stories of hope for the future?  Not white-washing the past or ignoring it, but holding out a sense of what might be possible moving forward.  We are called to “believe forward that God will do great things among us” says Rev. Phinney Baskette.  Looking at our text from Hebrew scriptures this morning, I wonder how on earth the prophet Jeremiah was able to “believe forward.”  The late 6th century BCE was a time of invasion and devastation for the Jewish nation.  How was the prophet able to speak of God continuing to do great things among the Jewish people?  Jeremiah sends word to those who had been dragged from Jerusalem and exiled to Babylon: “5Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce…have sons and daughters…seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the\\xa0Lord\\xa0on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.”  In a time of fear and deep frustration, where does hope come from?\\n\\tThis passage from Luke describes a group that also had a legitimate grievance story. How do you “believe forward that God will do great things among you” if you have a dreaded and very visible skin disease?  In those days, people afflicted with leprosy were shunned by their surrounding society; they were seen as sinful, unclean, and outside of God’s grace.  If you happened to somehow get cured of an illness like leprosy, you were required to see a Temple priest for a special cleansing ritual.  Only then would you be seen as spiritually fit to rejoin the community as a healed, clean and whole person. \\nThe gathered crowd would be not only shocked to see hopeful things happening to a group lepers.  They would be surprised to hear polite, grateful words coming from the Samaritan leper.  The Samaritan, the foreigner who is not liked or appreciated by the Jews (and the feeling was mutual for the Samaritans), is the only person in the story who says “thank-you” for his healing. He steps forward and falls at Jesus feet, praising God.  Jesus wonders out loud, so the crowd won’t miss it: “weren’t there 10 of you?  Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”  The Samaritan is the one whose faith doesn’t sit within him like an inert block of belief.  His faith is a verb; he is acting faithfully as he expresses his gratitude.  Something about this has made him well.  \\n\\tWhat is it about gratitude that might bring healing and hope?  A recent study by two social science professors, (Robert A. Emmons and Michael E. McCullough, conducted a study on “Gratitude and Thankfulness Dimensions.”) explored whether or not a grateful outlook had a measurable effect on psychological and physical well-being. Did it really reduce fear, resentment and anxiety in people?  The researchers looked at the difference between “counting your blessings” and “counting your burdens.”   Is it any wonder that they discovered that when people regularly make a weekly listing of life’s blessings things seemed better?  These people had “a more positive and optimistic appraisal of one’s life, more time spent exercising and fewer reported physical symptoms.” (p. 386).  “Grateful people are more likely to acknowledge a belief in the interconnectedness of all life and a commitment to and responsibility to others” (McCullough et. al., 2002). \\n\\tThere also was a curious “spiraling effect” where the “experience of gratitude, and the actions they did when they felt grateful, built and strengthen social bonds and friendships.” (p. 388)  And then they would end up feeling more grateful….and more connected….and more grateful.   \\n\\tAs I pondered the Jeremiah passage in light of these learnings about gratitude, I realized that the prophet was telling the Jewish people pretty much the same thing.  Their country was overrun by the Assyrians, they had been dragged off to live in exile in Babylon.  They had lost their beautiful city Jerusalem and their religious center the Temple.  They had cause to be fearful, angry and doubtful about connecting with God at all in this foreign land.  Jeremiah proclaims that God wants them settle in, to marry, work and contribute to the welfare of their new rulers, the Babylonians.  And in doing so, in connecting with their surroundings and gratefully acknowledging what was there in the midst of the difficulties, they too would prosper.  “You are connected to your captors; pray for them. Be here…be here in what is right in front of you…pay attention to it, connect with it…I am here with you,” says God.  \\n\\tGratitude is not a cure for everything, like clinical depression or cancer, poverty or deep grief.    But something about acknowledging the things we are grateful for, changes us. The congregation of First Church Berkeley experienced this reality: Gratefulness that no one was injured, gratefulness for the firefighters, for strangers sending money for the rebuilding fund, for a willingness to dig in but not hunker down in fear and frustration.  In the midst of a mess, they were compelled to rethink their church programming and space useage; it pushed them to become a congregation somewhat different from what they had been, with a renewed sense of what God called them to next.  The gratitude study reveals that even before we actually experience the emotion of gratefulness, in giving thanks we will start to think more clearly. We get more flexible and creative in our thinking, which in turn helps us deal with stress and adversity better (p.388).  Flexible and creative thinking, considering things from someone else’s perspective, will allow us to sort through the past and learn from it.  This helps us “believe forward” into God’s new future for this church.\\n\\tThe feared and marginalized Samaritan man who turned back and fell at Jesus’ feet, acknowledged his connectedness to Jesus, his receiving of something of value.  He thanked and praised God, and all of this changed him.   Blessings surround us, in the midst of all that is wrong here and in this world.  It is ours to pay attention and give thanks; allowing fear and resentment to be replaced with hope.   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThis text from Deuteronomy, what we call the Old or the First Testament, seems pretty straightforward: it’s better to chose life over death.  When we hear it starkly like that, there seems to be little more to say:  Of course…chose life over death!  That’s obvious, I can be down with that….wow, a 15 second sermon! Time for Coffee Hour!   But if “chose life over death” is so obvious, why is this choice so very hard?  And I think it is difficult, to keep choosing life over death.  Which is probably why Moses spoke these words as his “last-will-and-testament” before he died.  Moses had led the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt, and helped them form into a community of justice and mercy under God’s guidance as they wandered for 40 years in the Exodus wilderness.  Now, finally looking out over the promised land of Canaan, Moses gives the fledgling Jewish community these this final message:  Here is the deal, folks.  I won’t be going with you on this next part of your journey.  “I set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity.”    Walk in God’s ways, follow God’s commandments and don’t chase after idols.  You choose, life or death, blessings of land and plenty and loving God, or curses of no land and perishing.   But is life ever this black and white?  This is starting to sound pretty autocratic and harsh.   We might be inclined to simply dismiss this reading; it’s the Old Testament, right, that’s all about God’s law and judgment and the New Testament is all about God’s love!    \\n\\n\\tOn to the New Testament reading from the Gospel of Matthew, for something a little more palatable? Cheery?  More loving?  And here is Jesus, appearing to double-down on teachings “of ancient times” and making everything way harsher.  These are not casual behavior suggestions. These words of Jesus are clearly directive: they exhort; they tell us in no uncertain term what to do and what not to do.  More hackle-raising scripture texts, we may mutter to ourselves.  I think of how Thomas Jefferson was known to take scissors to his Bible, excising the problematic passages until it looked like swiss cheese.  We could have everyone stand up and go to one of four corners in the Sanctuary, depending on what offends us most in this Matthew passage:  Everyone bugged by Jesus’ view on resentment and anger being worse than murder, go to the far corner on that side?  Don’t like Jesus saying that lust and leering are worse than adultery?  Repulsed by the injunctions to cut off offending parts of our bodies?  Go to the far corner on the other side.  Offended to hear that remarrying is connected to adultery?  Hang out up here wth me, because I’m really annoyed about that one.  And this final whopper, don’t swear by anything!  Gather up here on the other side of the chancel if you think swearing by God, the Bible or your mother’s grave is better than lying.   Which one of these four commandments bug you the most?  And you thought the ancient Torah teachings of the Law were tough? says Jesus.  Check out what I’m going to ask you to do if you want to follow me, if you want to actually live harmoniously in community.  Choosing life over death has now become more complicated.\\n\\tThe problem with being told to do or not do something is that we often bristle, feel resistant, perhaps even a bit defensive.  Anyone having ever lived with a toddler knows that this starts at about age 2.  At that age, we are beginning to develop a sense of our self as separate from our parents, and this involves some inevitable challenging of authority.  “No!” the 2 year old delights is saying, with ferocious enthusiasm!  As we become older and start to separate from our parents, we grow as a separate individual who is still connected to a family unit.  And we often define ourselves by who our family is not.  In 8th grade I declared I was an atheist, in part because my parents were not.  As a senior in high school I became strongly evangelical in my Christian faith, in part because my parents were most assuredly not evangelical Christians.  Both of these religious stands had to do in part with my striving to do (what psychologists have come to call) the necessary “separation and individuation” to become an autonomous adult.      \\nAs adolescents and young adults, many of us talk of wanting to be “free” but we are not yet sure just what this might mean.   “Free” for what?  As an adult, I have come to realize that simply being oppositional to authority, without figuring out for myself what I value and believe, was a dead end. I might be against this or that, but what was I ultimately for?   \\n\\tToday’s scripture passage from Matthew gives us guidance on this that really “ups the ante” when it comes to living in community.  To figuring out what we are free for…. Paradoxically, these ways of living may lead to what can make us the most free: choosing life over death on a daily basis, in our every-day choices. \\nBut we have to be careful not to pull Jesus’ words out of their historical and cultural context.  Take care not to get diverted by today’s translation that has Jesus saying you’ll “be liable to the hell of fire.”  The actual word is not hell, but Gehanna.  In Jewish tradition, this word referenced an actual valley where long ago people used to sacrifice children to the Canaanite god Moloch.  Like saying to naughty children, “you hit your brother again and we will send you to Gehanna”…or fill in the blank for whatever scarey institution like a prison or mental hospital was down the road.  \\t \\nJesus had an uncanny way of understanding the perceptions, attitudes and emotions that often come before an act that is contrary to God’s Law.  The behaviors of murder, adultery, divorce or swearing falsely all are preceded by a subtle but significant shift in how we are thinking and feeling.  And that shift is what Jesus was concerned about, because these shifts can move us towards deadening spiral in our lives.  We loose vitality and we begin to hurt ourselves and other people.   We start to choose death, not life.\\n\\tDr. Amy Oden, professor of Church History at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, has written that Jesus’ challenging people to a ”righteousness in this new Kingdom of God that was more than following rules.”  (WorkingPreacher.org commentary, Epiphany 6A).   In Jesus’ time, simply following the rules meant that in both the patriarchal Jewish and Roman society any married woman could be divorced and discarded quite easily.  It took us until the 20th century to pass laws in this country that protect women from automatically loosing their property, children and livelihood when a marriages ends.  First century women lost everything; they were left destitude. This isn’t right, said Jesus.  Participation in the Kingdom of God entails a different kind of righteousness.  Its about a mutual love and support that brings mercy, justice and compassion to human intention and behavior.  \\n\\tIn considering Jesus’ command about murder, Professor Oden admits that when we are in disagreement with someone else in our church community, few of us actually consider killing that person.  But how many times have we been angry over some perceived slight or some unresolved misunderstanding in the church? In an effort to be polite or keep the peace, we choose a small death: we either keep it inside or we go “sideways” and tell someone else about how bothered we are, venting, hoping that word will be “passed along”  It amazes me that while Jesus never founded a church like we know it today, he was spot-on about one of the most common problems in congregations:  unresolved conflict which simmers and seeps and moves side-ways, and sucks the life and trust out of a congregation. Thriving churches such as ours learn that everyone will be heard, but everyone doesn’t always get their way.  Vital churches such as ours are learning how to handle inevitable disagreements with honesty and love.  Thanks be to God.\\n\\tOne thing I find so compelling about Jesus is his ability to see inside people.  In following the Spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, I am helped to see inside myself.  I’m becoming more and more aware that I am faced with choices between life-giving attitudes and actions, and between death-giving attitudes and actions.  Make it a spiritual practice to notice this week, where you see those subtle choices, between life and death, before you.  \\t \\n\\tGod’s indwelling Spirit helps me honestly face the stuff on the inside, my internal orientation that initiates my actions.  “This is where the choosing life or death really lies,” implies Jesus.   It’s way before the murderous action; it is in the resentment and grudges we harbor.  It is way before the adulterous affair; it is in the way we pay more attention to work, sports or the Internet instead of our life partner (Amy Oden, IBID).   The choice is way before the actual divorce; it is in the slow breakdown of communication and mutual respect.  It’s way before the swearing falsely, it is in our equivocating.  It is when we refuse to let our “yes” be “yes” and our “no” be “no.”  \\nI am challenged by these teachings to my bones.   For me, they are freedom-filled and life-giving.  They help me choose life.  Amen. ',\n",
       " '\\tHave you ever noticed that being busy, getting a lot of things done, can actually give you a rush?  Oh of course, a full plate of activities, be it household chores, meetings with full agendas, full-on kid care, outdoor physical labor….all this can certainly exhaust us.  But who hasn’t noticed the adrenaline rush, it’s almost like feeling “high,” from a couple of hours or full day of busyness!  Not to mention the sense of accomplishment and self-importance that being productive gives us!  This scripture text from Mark, where the disciples come back from days of busy work out in the ministry field, preaching, healing, doing good works in Jesus name:  I’ll bet they were feeling an adrenaline rush! “Wow, Jesus, you wouldn’t believe how people responded to our message!  Yeah, the healings and casting out of evil spirits we did?  Far out, man!  Whew, it was awesome!”  Can’t you just see Jesus watching them closely as he listens, nodding his head, a knowing, and compassionate smile on his lips.  What does the gospel writer Mark tell us next?  “And Jesus praised them for all that they had done in his name” - ?  No.  I can almost hear Jesus sigh heavily as the accounting of the disciples’ busy noble deeds winds down.  “Come away,” he says to them, “come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.”  Not just “slow down,” but “stop.”  Get to a deserted place, by yourselves.  Rest.\\n\\t\\n\\tSummertime in latitudes such as ours has for a long-time been associated with periods of leisure and renewal.  Temperatures would start to climb, kids out of school, families would go on vacation.  Even in an agriculturally based farming community, where crops needed planting, tending and harvesting through this season, there used to be a clearer rhythm of work and relaxation.  Sundays were not for shopping and more work; they were a day of rest, worship, family time. Not to idealize life before air conditioning, but everyone probably slowed down and rested a bit more frequently, because you could faint from too much sustained work in the heat.  Tall glass of sweet tea in the shade of a tree, simple pleasure of slowly biting into a ripe tomato.  Lingering dusk, late after dinnertime.  The sound of birds, cicadas, crickets….glowing fireflies the warm darkness.  I wonder sometimes with our 24/7 lives if we have lost a sense of what the summer season may be trying to teach us.  \\n\\nThrough much of the year, we yearn for the ease of warmth on our skins and sunlight that stretches into evenings.  Long favored by children everywhere, summer often signals a break, a change, few responsibilities, and hopefully, more playtime.  But for most grown-ups, this luxurious season often disappears under a blur of ongoing work and volunteer projects, numerous outdoor chores in preparation for yet another winter, and brief, hectic vacations.  Summertime, and the livin is easy, catfish are jumpin and the cotton is high goes the Gershwin song.  Yet it becomes easy, as responsible adults, to simply ignorer our longing to slow down and loll and dawdle and rest in summer.  We tend to dismiss as slothful any desire to simply sit and bask and ripen, like a warm peach in the mid-July sun.  Purposeless moments of unplanned nothing can make some of us nervous, and the laze, the ease of simply “being” in summer may elude us.  \\n\\nYou and I live in a predominant culture that values productivity. “Who” we are gets connected to what we produce.  According to a recent study on family life in middle class America, we are “so consumed with working, collecting, amassing possessions and generally getting ahead that we speed very little time together enjoying what we are working for.” (David Lose, “Rest” posted on workingpreacher.org, July 15, 2012).  We live in a competitive consumerism that defines us by how much we do and make.  Proudly, when asked how we are doing, we reply, “oh, I’m so busy!”  I’m not talking about people who juggle three jobs just to make ends meet; they simply report they are “tired.”  Those in this study who said they are “way busy all the time,” reported spending little to no time outside, and any leisure time focused on TV and computer.  There seemed to be no time for real rest.  \\n\\nWho are we when we are not producing, when we are not DOING?  I wonder if some of the disciples, flush with recent success out in the field of great human need, started objecting to the idea of taking a break.  “Jesus, we have to keep going; so many people need us!”  Who are we when we are not consumed with our busy productivity?  Some of us get our first taste of the question when we struggle with physical decline from an accident or illness or chronic condition.  Or when we try and take some quiet moments for prayer and meditation.  “I’m wasting time,” we groan to ourselves.  When we try and follow Jesus’ example and “go off to a lonely place” to connect more deeply with God’s spirit in our heart, it can make us anxious.  Because we have to face the awkward fact that it just doesn’t look like we are doing anything; we’re not being PRODUCTIVE!\\n\\nMaybe summer slowness is an invitation to think of God’s grace, God’s attitude towards us, in a new way.  When it comes to how much God values each of us, just as we are, God may be less interested in all our good works than we think.  Besides the obvious need for a warm growing season, what might God be telling us about life itself in this particular season of summer?  What can our soul learn in the classroom of summer?  \\n \\n“The Lord is my shepherd, he leads me beside still waters.  He makes me like down in green pastures.”  God is big on times of rest.  God did it on the seventh day of creation, and God commands us to take regular Sabbath rest.  It’s so important, God “makes” us do it.  In that spirit, one of my clergy colleagues suggested that we each figure out something that we might NOT do this week.  What might you not do? Some task or happening or something from which you will abstain this week.  Write it down, said my colleague.  Then we might think about one restful thing we will allow ourselves that doesn’t involve more TV or computer time.  Stare at the night sky?  Get down on the floor and lazily join a grandchild in building with Legos?  Float in some warmish water and watch the clouds?   \\n\\nWe each need some Summer school for the soul, time and rest in which we find a deeper awareness of God’s generosity and grace.  Where we are reminded that all our doing does not make us more precious in God’s sight.  “Come away and rest awhile,” says Jesus.  Taste again the comfort and the safety, the over-flowing goodness of this glorious creation, and the gifts of our loving Creator.  Thanks be to God for this invitation.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tI imagine we have a variety of perspectives in this congregation about God.  What is God is up to in the course of natural disasters, personal tragedies and in this world of ours in general?   I personally do not believe that God saves certain people from suffering and choses not to save others.  For me, this is not God’s job description: I would claim that God is in the middle of human suffering and joy.  But if that is true, how are we to understand what difference this can make in our lives?\\nLast week we heard again the wild story of Pentecost, where Jesus’ disciples were suddenly filled with the power of the Holy Spirit sent by God.  They had been grieving and struggling with the difficult question of “what on earth was God up to in letting Jesus be killed?”  But after Pentecost, these men and women start to courageously speak out about being filled with the Holy Spirit and a profound sense of new life. Risking everything, they step forward, testifying about their personal, life-changing experiences of God, Jesus and the indwelling of God’s renewing power.   Did the God of the first century act differently than the God of the 21st?  What is God’s job description, anyway?\\n\\t Oddly enough, questions like these make the notion of the Trinity helpful for me.  God shows up in three ways, three persons: Father/Mother Creator, Brother/Savior Jesus and Sustainer Holy Spirit.  This dusty ancient doctrine challenges my assumptions about how God works in the world and reminds me that God is not some magic Santa in the sky waiting to reward or punish me.  Traditionally, the Sunday following Pentecost is designated as Trinity Sunday.  It took the official Christian church about 300 years to formulate this symbolic language about Father-Son-Holy Ghost.   All this creedal debate was apparently stimulated by considerable controversy about Jesus himself.  Who was he?  Divine in some way, a divine creature in human disguise, or all human?  By the time Christianity became linked with ruling powers, the official church seemed less concerned with experiencing the transformative power of the Risen Jesus and focused more on what you actually believed about Jesus.  Creeds, along with this ancient Trinitarian wording, “Father, Son and Holy Ghost” became the shorthand poetic language used to talk about God-in-the-world and the God-Jesus-Spirit Three-in-one connection.  \\n\\tBut creeds tend to divide and even exclude people. Are they useful at all today?  One of our United Church of Christ treasures is church historian and author, Barbara Brown Zigmund.  She has helped me understand that this Trinity metaphor of God as creator, redeemer and sustainer describes God as “one God existing in community.”  The Trinity speaks of how “God embodies the very nature of reality as relational and communal” (Barbara Brown Zigmund, Christian Century, 4/15/87).  Is this ancient notion of the Trinity another way of saying: everything is connected? She starts to sound like a quantum physicist!  But I hear that same relational and communal aspect of God in today’s reading from Book of Proverbs:  Wisdom, a feminine noun in the original Hebrew, was there with God at the beginning of time.  Wisdom, as the divine feminine spirit of God?  Partner with God?  There may be more “we-ness” to God than we think.  “Let us create humans in our image,” God speaks in Genesis, “male and female let us create them.” BBZ’s point is that “we are all connected…and God is a part of that precious connectedness.”   We get this, don’t we, when we speak of connections between people as being so important to us in this congregation?\\nAs he was saying goodbye, Jesus reassured his followers that “the Spirit of truth” would come to them and guide them in all truth. Even in the midst of transitions and changes that are unsettling and make us anxious. Once again, we find Jesus grappling with simple words that describe a great mystery:  this aspect of the divine that has been present at the beginning of creation is with you always!  This Spirit, this Comforter and Advocate, surrounding and within and uniting all of us.  But how to imagine this?  I need some visuals! \\n\\tSometimes I see in my mind’s eye billions of thin filaments like fiber-optic cable, running from God to each of us and between us, weaving a web of sparking connection among all things.  Sometimes I imagine a vast cloud, an ether, filled with particles of insight, flowing between God and humans.  A relational network: humming, vibrating, connecting us.  Crackling energy of a relational community of God, within God the Creator, Jesus the son and the Holy Spirit.  And all this energy flowing out over and among us.\\nSort of like a relational overflow!  We get chances to practice seeing this everyday. The next time you gaze into someone else’s eyes, or look up into a tree, plunge your hands into damp earth or stare at the stars: picture the vibrating connections of this loving universal force, God-self crackling back and forth.    Proverbs describes God and Wisdom as constantly “rejoicing in God’s inhabited world and delighting in the human race.”  Even as we make a mess of our world, our families, our church our personal lives, God delights in the human race.  \\n\\tAbout 600 years ago, a Russian Orthodox monk named Andrei Rublev tried to visualize this idea of the Holy Trinity.  It was during a time of great political unrest, violence and danger in their native land.  Rublev was aware that amidst the turmoil and fear of their times, words were failing him and his fellow monks.  The monks under his charge just could not bear to hear more words, so he created a special kind of devotional painting known as an icon for his fellow monks.  An icon is created for the viewer to look through, like a window.  A window through which we can encounter new aspects of the divine.  As if to say:  If we are visually able, when words fail us and feelings overwhelm us, we can still see.  We can still gaze.   (Richard Rohr’s book about the Trinity, The Divine Dance)  There is a reproduction of Rublev’s icon on the front page of our Order of Service.   Gaze with me for a moment.\\n\\tLet your eyes wander over these three beings in this icon.  Notice how their long, lean bodies are a bit gender-bending: are they male figures? Their faces might be those of identical sisters.   Each one has wings, robes of differing colors, and is holding a thin staff, as if to suggest they are each on a journey.  Yet they are seated around a table-like structure, with some kind of bowl or chalice between them.   Who are they?  People? Angels?  Rublev knew the story of the early Jewish patriarch and matriarch, Abraham and Sarah.  In the Book of Genesis, we learn that God had led the couple and their extended family out of their homeland, with a promise God’s presence, of new land and offspring.  But in their old age the couple remained childless.   One day, Abraham notices three strangers – angels? – approaching their tents near the oak of Mamre.  He invites them to table, where the couple feeds them, as one does with the unexpected sojourner in one’s midst.  The mysterious strangers have a message for the couple:  you are going to have a child.  What Rublev noticed in the Biblical story is that at this point Abraham starts to address the three messengers as a single entity – as Lord.  God in three persons?   Rublev paints this scene of the three angelic messengers, gathered around the table sharing a meal, as a symbol of three-in-one: the Holy Trinity of God as Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.   The Persons of the Holy Trinity metaphorically hanging around gazing on each other, grooving in each other’s presence.  \\n\\tNotice how the three figures incline their heads to one another.  With quiet humbleness, their eyes are on one another.  Tender affection flowing between the different aspects of God?  Relational energy of both love and curiosity moving between them?  For Rublev, the figure on the left represents God the Creator, divine parent, dressed in an almost irredescent flowing robe.  In the center is Jesus, with dense colors of blue and red, his two outstretched fingers signifying both his human and divine nature.  And to the right, the Holy Spirit, outfitted in earthy, life-giving green.  I am drawn in as I gaze on this icon….for a reason.  Art historians note that “the three figures are not part of a disappearing plane, with a vanishing point in the distance, but rather seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  (p. 133, Rohr).\\n\\tAh, that is it!  There is a fourth figure in this circle of attentive gazing, and that is the viewer.  It is you.  It is me.  The three figures “seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  We are at the table with these three, declared Rublev, we are part of this circle of attentiveness, of quietly animated interaction.  We are part of this exchange of mutual knowing and loving.\\n\\tSpend some time gazing at this image this week; take your place at this table.  Find other marvels to hold your gaze: lake, sky, forest, animals, people. May our contemplation remind of us of our place within this vibrant, crackling energy of God the Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.  I believe this gazing practice can give us the inspiration, the energy to keep taking risks.  It can allow us to continue to be church when it is unclear who will be here or what will happen next.  Risking to come together as the faith community so we can experience this spilling over, synapse-snapping overflow of God more intimately.  So we can be propelled out by the Spirit of Truth, empowered to serve in the world.  Amen.',\n",

       " '\\nTHIS DIVISIVE GOOD NEWS\\n\\n\\tThis series of sayings seems like an impossible text.  Jesus, our Prince of Peace, announcing that he comes NOT to bring peace…but to bring division.  In congregation’s such as ours, where we follow the Revised Common Lectionary schedule of weekly Bible verses, your pastor is sincerely wishing she was on vacation this Sunday.  This proclamation, that households will be divided, father against son, daughter against mother, comes to us in the middle of a hot summer.  Given discord and divisiveness on our international, national and local scene, this does not sound like good news.  For congregations that have been through painful conflict, this does not sound like the Good News of the Gospel that is supposed to bring peace on earth.  And isn’t the Good News, the Gospel, of Jesus Christ supposed to be about human togetherness and accord?  Yet Jesus starts out talking about bringing “fire” to earth, which can make us either nervous or turned-off by implications of firey judgement and a punishing God.  And after laying this dreary conflict prediction upon his closest followers, why in the world does Jesus turn to the assembled crowd and rather rudely call them “hypocrites?”  Jesus chides them for not knowing “how to interpret the present time” whatever that is supposed to mean.  Might the disciples be rolling their eyes, at this point: “Gheeze, Jesus, could you chill out!”  \\t\\n\\tIn congregations bruised by recent division and conflict, there is always the hope that finding a new clergy leader will solve the problem.  Chose the right pastor, clarity of vision and common purpose will appear and you won’t have more disagreements, division and conflict!  This assumption is not unlike the dreams of those of us who marry for a second or a third time.  If I just choose the right marriage partner, this time around, we won’t argue and fight; there won’t be division and conflict.  Back in May, I read a rather unsettling article about marriage in the Week in Review Section of the Sunday New York Times: “Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person” by the author Alain de Botten.   Interestingly, one of the co-chairs of our current Pastoral Search Committee also read it and sent me the link, saying: I wonder if this might have something to do with choosing a new pastor? Which was exactly what I had been thinking as I read the article.  In choosing both a marriage partner, and in choosing a pastor, are we inevitably going to end up choosing the wrong person?   Could this be bad news or possibly some weird twist on good news?  The author appears to believe that this is neutral news because it is simply what is real in most cases.   De Botten writes: We marry the wrong person “partly, because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others.”  I thought of how, over the years, the relationship between a pastor and a congregation deepens.  Each side in this convental relationship changes through time, comes to new self-awareness, experiences different reactions to the churches evolving situation.  And these changes often produce conflict.\\n\\tI thought of the Pastoral Search process as I read this piece: “We seem normal only to those who don’t know us very well,” writes de Botten. “In a wiser, more self-aware society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: “And how are you crazy?”   This made me laugh, as I tried to imagine a pastoral search interview in which I might be asked, “and please tell us in what ways you are crazy.”\\n\\t“Nobody’s perfect,” continues the author. “The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day.”  This is why some people leave churches: conflict arises with what the pastor is doing; it is easier to blame the pastor or lay leaders than it is to explore our own accountability in the problem.  Often folks just “call it a day” and leave.  De Botten describes how for centuries, people would marry for a variety of logical reasons, mostly having to do with family, religion and cultural matching.  Not that these marriages were always happy, non-exploitive or safe, but they were logical.  Now, we marry for feeling: “two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right.” He describes that  “the prestige of instinct (in our culture) is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason” as a guide for choosing marriage partners.  This rang some bells for me.  I have actually heard from search committees who chose a pastor, after lengthy interviewing, based on how they themselves felt when that person walked in the door of the initial meeting.  “I just knew he was the one!” or “it was love at first sight – we knew she was our perfect pastor.”  \\t\\n\\tIn searching for a pastor, we may assume we, like couples looking for a mate, are seeking personal and communal happiness in the relationship.  It is quite unsettling when we begin to realize a perfect being does not exist who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning.  We are forced to learn how to fight fair and resolve our differences.  The author concludes: “We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us — and we will (without any malice) do the same to them.”  Or put closer to home, for us in this church at this time, every pastor will “frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint you,” if they are here long enough – and you, hopefully “without malice, will do the same” to your pastor.  What will matter, what will grow you as the Body of Christ in this place, is how you deal with this and work together for something besides your own personal happiness and consumer satisfaction.  In fact, if some kind of divisiveness and conflict isn’t happening between you, you may have a different kind of problem.  \\n            I once heard the church consultant Speed Leas talk about the levels of conflict that can occur in a congregation.  He described five levels, from a collaborative problem solving that focuses not on personalities but the issue at hand, all the way up to conflict where people are trying to hurt others, win by being right, get rid of people, or finally even destroy someone else.   He talked about disagreement and division as actually being natural and good for a church, as it helps us each get clear about what is most important around here.  Rev. Leas also says you can be at Zero Level, where no one discusses anything divisive and walks on egg shells, that leads to a kind of depression, a loss of congregational energy and hopefulness.  The congregation is also often not addressing emerging social justice issues that the Gospel calls them to confront, because this would cause conflict among them!  Interesting – the absence of conflict does not necessarily lead to happiness, probably not in marriage, not in our public political realm and not in congregations either.  It’s how we deal with the conflict.  \\n\\tYou and I live in a divided and broken world, where following Jesus does not necessarily bring a sense of peaceful happiness to every situation.  But as I look closer at today’s text, Jesus seems to imply that division itself is seldom the problem.  It’s just the reality.  Differences in everything from how to wash the dishes to how to run our economy.  But how do we talk about these differences with each other?  How well do we listen, pausing to really understand what the other person is saying?  Listening, and not just waiting for our turn to prove a point?\\n\\tI do believe that God has a “divine peace plan” (Feasting on the Word quote) for the world, but it may look different from what we at first imagine.   So often, maintaining a happy harmony can also maintain power imbalance and injustices among us.  The recent shootings of black men is regretful, we might lament, but could we just move on, back to a happy harmony?  Could Black Lives Matter stop protesting now?  Can they please not block roads and spoil the State Fair?  “Do you think I came to bring peace on earth?” asks Jesus.  Inequality between blacks and whites has a long history in our nation.  Fixing this will be disruptive to our lives as we know it.  But apparently the implementing of God’s divine peace plan is disruptive, it challenges the status quo.  The Good News of Jesus Christ is divisive.  God’s reign of mercy, compassion and justice on earth does not come easily.   The real work of the Gospel will challenge assumptions of priviledge.  God’s divine peace plan will always seek to shatter the inequities of the current status quo. \\n\\tYes, this is a hard text.  Following Jesus leads us into some divisive places, where we make difficult choices between happy harmony and the actual healing of our broken communities.  Jesus reminds us that conflict will happen.  And that the division is a good sign we are actually following his teachings and his spirit among us.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t   \\n ',\n",
       " 'This Kingdom language goes way back to what we call the Old Testament times, in a period when Jews had moved beyond looking directly to God and the Torah law for leadership.  Originally, “God alone was their leader; they were to be different from other nations and empires in Mesopotamia.” (Walter Wink). And within that covenant agreement, they agreed to follow God’s laws which taught an unusual sharing of power and resources among the people. But eventually there were kings put in place, with armies to raise and tribute to collect.  Many of them, along with the powerful elite, ruled out of what we might call their own ego needs.  They refused to rule under the direction of God’s Torah, their holy Law:  As Isaiah decribes, the royal court and wealthy merchants did not do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans and widows.  Isaiah claimed it weakened them as a nation, making them vulnerable, over and over, to invasions by foreign powers.  We might say, as a nation, their “glass” definitely looked half-empty at this point  Beginning about the mid-second century before Jesus birth, Biblical writers came up with a unique version of is our life together “half empty or half full?”  The Jewish community started claiming that the glass of human history was actually “cracked” and desperately in need of repair.  \\nAccording to Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan, around the 2nd century BCE, Biblical writers started to describe how, in a time to come, “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom (on earth) that will never be destroyed.”  Our current and treasured divisions between politics and religion are frankly too simplistic to understand how they envisioned the cracks in the glass being mended, world being healed.  God’s kingdom wouldn’t quite be a place, it was more a verb – God’s reigning in a different manner than corrupt human rulers.  It would involve everything: government, the economy, religious institutions, all of society.  Tikkun olam, the Jews called it in Hebrew.  To heal the world.  And Jesus picks up on this as he begins to teach.  “God wants you to have this Kingdom, this reigning of peace and justice and mercy.”\\nIn today’s passage from Luke, Jesus talking about our fears, where our security lies and what it means that this Kingdom of God is at hand.  I think both the Luke and Isaiah passages circle around the challenge of creating a just and peaceful world, be it the larger national scene or closer-to-home scene of this church, and our own inner well-being.  I suggest we consider these two scripture passages through the lens of a current conversation we’re having here at our church about what it means tobe a Just Peace church.  This is a designation created by the United Church of Christ over 30 years ago as a witness to “the interrelation of friendship, justice, and common security from violence.” Two Sundays ago, a group of about 16 of you joined me and Jeff Kern after worship for discussion about our church’s history as a Just Peace Church.  We remembered how your former pastor, Ben Crosby, had been so inspired by his participation in the national gathering of the United Church of Christ in the summer of 1987, where the denomination proclaimed itself as a Just Peace Church, that he came back here and introduced the concept of “Just Peace” to this congregation.  Emerging during the Cold War years of the arms race with the Soviet Union, the concept of a “Just Peace” was developed as an alternative to the idea of “Just War.”  Just War theory has a long tradition in Christian history and was originally seen as a corrective to the extremes of crusades or of total pacifism.  Considering whether a war was just or not was a means by which people of faith would rationally consider their country’s involvement in the violence of war, given the Biblical imperative to not kill each other.  Briefly, a Just War would be one that met certain requirements, including, the military force is justified to defend innocent people and moral values, and the force is enacted ethically.   Just Peace was a recognition that you could have an enforced peace, such as that in the Soviet Union at the time, but it may not necessarily be just, honoring the equity and rights of all people.\\nThe Just Peace pronouncement developed at the General Synod gathering that your pastor Ben Crosby attended, was really a vision of what the Kingdom of God looks like.   Is the vote of this congregation in 1987 to become a Just Peace church still meaningful to your life together as a congregation?  What kind of new or re-vitalized social justice and outreach initiatives might we engage to live out that important legacy here?  During the 1980’s this call went out to UCC churches across the land, encouraging us to consider the wider, systemic violence in the challenging justice issues of the day: racism, environmental degradation, food insecurity, lack of access to proper healthcare/education/housing/jobs, to name a few.  UCC churches across the country debated their role in society.  This congregation decided to explore how these injustices could be acknowledged and confronted non-violently.  Do we simply try and help directly feed, house and comfort people, or do we also try and figure out and change the systems that cause certain people to be hungry, unsheltered and mistreated?   Isaiah would say, some 1800 years earlier, this is doing good, working to see that God’s peace, God’s shalom, extended to all humankind.  This local church decided to grapple with this wide umbrella of Just Peace through the years, seeking to do both charity and justice work that would help change unjust systems.  Letter writing on behalf of the hunger organization Bread for the World, yearly support of a shrimp boil dinner raising funds for the justice work with impoverished communities on the Gulf Coast through Back Bay Mission.   And the trips and exchanges with a community in the region of Chiapas, Mexico.  These were never simply a mission trip “to go help people so we feel good about being helpers.” Personal relationships were built between people in this church and one Catholic parish, its priest, his staff and parishioners in the small town of Amantanango, outside of San Cristobal.  In addition, connections were made with UCC world mission staff working with Guatamalean refugees flowing into Mexico at the time.  These impoverished Mexican communities were the leaders in these relationships, informing this church what they needed.  And this church responded and people came back home here to tell the stories of what they experienced and how they were personally changed by these encounters.   This is a powerful legacy, in my mind, of how one lives out being a Just Peace church.  I wonder where a renewed commitment to this legacy might lead us next?\\t\\n\\tSo what did Jesus mean by “the Kingdom of God?  A reign of Just Peace, where there is equity and well-being for all.  Jesus was not just talking about some interior moral kingdom in our hearts. Yes, he taught that “the KOG is within you,” an animating force already inside of us.  And Jesus also described an outer world in which equality and fairness and compassion rule.   Which says a lot about how we are to act with one another as Just Peace church.  Hostility and blaming has no place among us as a Just Peace congregation.  Disagreements, yes.  Conflict over things that matter? Bring it on!  But our interactions will be done with respect, empathy and openness.  Finally, this just peaceness among us can’t wait.  Consider the urgency in Jesus’ parable of the master coming home and needing to find that the servants are ready and waiting.  Attentiveness, diligence is needed as we learn to become kingdom partners with God.  God yearns for us to collaborate with God, to partner with God’s good pleasure. Let’s keep talking about what this might look like among us. Amen.\\n\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\tWhat would you say if a beloved teacher and leader kept talking about his immanent arrest and execution?  If you or I were to receive this shocking news from someone we deeply trusted, we might react in one of two way:  we might either rise up in dispute, “no way, your’re wrong, we can’t let that happen!” or we space out, we might dissaociate, almost pretending like the comment never happened.  “James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to Jesus and said to him: “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”  What?  This cannot end well.  We might remember the story of King Herod, who was entranced by Salome’s exotic dancing that he promised her whatever she asked of him.  And that certainly didn’t end well, what with John the Baptist’s severed head on a platter!  The disciples have completely ignored what Jesus has just said about his suffering and death.  \\nSo what is up with these two disciples, James and John?  Their request sounds strange to us, but they seem to be yearning and even scheming for some kind of priviledged position.  Jesus, here so very patient and compassionate in the face of this odd request to do whatever they ask, simply replies, “well what do you want me to do for you?”  I can see one of these guys smiling smugly and saying, “Jesus, when you are in your glory, after you die and are resurrected, we want to be near you, in fact James here wants to sit on your right hand and I want to sit on your left hand!”  The other disciples eyes go wide in surprise, and understandable annoyance.  But haven’t we each had our James-and-John-moments?  Times when we plan and plot for more priviledged postions in our community, at work, in our families?  This even happens in churches when someone announces: “I want you to do for me whatever I ask of you….or I just might withhold my offerings or go and find another church.”  But mostly we do this striving and positioning quietly…or put another way, “we want a lot of things that we never admit out loud.” (IBID, David Howell, p. 190) No kids in worship, no traditional hymns, nothing but traditional hymns, no money sent to the Minnesota Conference of the UCC, a huge proportion sent to the social justice ministries of the UCC.\\n\\tSo when James and John, some of first people to start following Jesus, ask their question, we do well to remember how we each have yearned for preferential treatment at times.  This urge can be very subtle and we have to watch for it like a hawk.  A few years ago, I participated in a church workshop held in the congregation where my family had attended while I was in high school.  This is now a big, flagship suburban Washington DC church in our Central Atlantic Conference of the United Church of Christ and they have a new woman pastor.  As we were touring the sanctuary at the lunch break, I found myself saying to the pastor:  oh, gracious, I haven’t been in this building since I came back in the late ‘80’s to co-officiate with the then current pastor at my sister’s wedding!  Was I saying this to make an interesting point of connection with my continuity with this church, or to establish my position as a co-professional with this other pastor?  In what way did my comment shift the focus from the beautiful sanctuary, the pastor’s current ministry there, and shift it to wonderful me?  Hmmmm…..see what I mean?  We all need to watch out for the ways in which self-promotion and priviledge seeking seeps into our lives, and we need to confess it and let God heal our self-absorption.  \\n\\tJesus knows it is nearly impossible for his contemporaries to hear the real news about the Kingdom of God.  Why?  Because we are so darn self-absorbed and often self-promoting!  We think this is what will make us safe and secure. But God does not appear to be overly concerned with our constant need to feel safe and secure; God has other plans for us.   Jesus arrives and continues to unfold the Biblical vision of healing and transformation of the world, starting with each of us.  Starting with basically an upheaval of how we think things should work.  Like, I need a position of importance and priviledge to feel safe and secure in this world!  Jesus talks about how the Gentile (non-Jewish) leaders rule the community by “lording over them” and being tyrants. “But it is not so among you;” continues Jesus, “whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave to all.”\\n\\tSo here it is, for the third time as the Gospel of Mark describes it.  Jesus talks about his own suffering, his servanthood on behalf of all of us, the disciples don’t get it, and Jesus describes how following him means being a giver, a server, not a receiver, not a served.  Jesus turns the disciples expectations upside-down.  The first shall be last, the last shall be first.  Whoever wishes to be first must be a server, a slave to all.  The Kingdom of God, God’s realm on this earth, is about serving, caring for, healing, transforming this hurting world.  Get on board, Jesus is telling his disciples.  \\n\\tThe workshop I attended that day focused on strengthening the ministries of the local church in two ways.  By getting clear and up-to-date in our describing of what we offer a spiritually hungry community.  By helping our congregations become more generous in their giving as a way of growing spiritually themselves. Re-thinking our hospitality to the stranger; accepting the responsibility of reaching out to the newcomer with curiousity and welcome, instead of simply sharing coffee hour with those we know.  One of the images that sticks in my mind from that workshop was that of two contrasting pictures on the video-screen in front of us.   Two adults were pictured sitting in a pew in church.  One adult with a bib tied around his neck, like the big ones you get for cracking crab in a restaurant.  The other adult a serving apron.  What do you wear in church, asked the conference leaders, are you wearing a bib and waiting to be served?  Or are you a person wearing an apron and are ready to serve?  When you come to worship each Sunday, are you a “guest” or are you a “host?”\\n\\tAs the Discovery Team and I discussed the scripture passages we would use for this visioning process, one of them made an interesting observation about the bib and apron analogy.   Sometimes in our adult life, we need to be wearing the bib:  we become sick or infirm; we get older and need help eating.  We need to be in a receiving mode so others can care for us.  And some of us resist this mightly, and we want our neediness kept private.  Please don’t put me on the prayer list!….and it makes it very hard for others to serve us.  Perhaps we are simply called to a deeper self-awareness as we explore hospitality to ourselves, to those we know, and to the strangers in our midst; can I listen to my deepest needs….today, do I need to serve and wear the apron?  Or is this a day I need to admit my vulnerability and allow myself to be taken care of….so others around me might serve?  \\n\\tJesus claimed that his followers were called to embody a different way of being in this world; to be a servant to all.  A role that contrasted with the striving for priviledge and position that prevails in the culture around us.  It’s upside-down from what our contemporary world says will make us happy and secure. Jesus knew that being a server and not the served is what can heal us.  But some of us may need a different kind of healing: our propensity for trying to be strong, needless and resisting any kind of dependence.  Where is it we each need to be transformed, today, so we can extend the radical hospitality that God wants us to provide?  When does God ask us to wear a bib?  To don an apron?  Perhaps we are both guests at God’s table, and are also hosts to all who are hungry for God’s love and forgiveness.  Where might we each be challenged to engage Jesus’ upside-down world this week, to “walk, talk and even suffer like Jesus“ in unexpected ways?  Both bibs and aprons, that appears to be the challenge.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.    \\n\\n\\t \\n \\n\\n\\n\\t \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tDinner’s like this one described in the passage from Luke were no private affair.  Although the details focus on the host, a certain Pharisee named Simon, Jesus and an unknown woman, there are most likely a number of others in the house:  more guests also reclined in the new Roman fashion around the table, those serving the food, Jesus disciples, and always the on-lookers.  We might imagine ourselves on the edge of the room, joining the curious people at the door and just outside….all eager to witness what this unusual teacher healer was going to do next.   We would know Simon, a respected a teacher of Jewish written Law in our city.  Maybe we had consulted him about the precepts which governed our spiritual and communal lives together.  He knew both the Torah given to Moses centuries before, which governed all of their lives, as well as the oral knowledge passed down from Moses to later generations, which had now been codified in the Talmud.  We would not be aware that the Pharisees would be portrayed so negatively in centuries to come, as the tension between synagogues and Jesus followers would grow after his death.  We would probably feel more comfortable around these working class Pharisees, compared to the aristocratic and priestly elites, the Sadducees.  As on-lookers, we are interested that Simon knows and respects Jesus, has invited him to his home and calls him “teacher.”  \\n\\n\\tBut this tale is not known as Simon’s story, which is curious in itself.  This story shows up in all four Gospels, which is unusual, and is known as the “story of the sinful woman.”  Luke never tells us who she is.  The woman is not named in the story and never speaks. What is really quite incredible is that different threads of this extraordinary encounter between Jesus and this unnamed woman actually have reached us some 2000 years later.   As we re-enter this ancient room, and carefully watch the scene unfold, I suggest that we may catch a glimpse of what God is doing in our midst today. \\n\\t   \\nIn each of the four New Testament Gospels, we have a story of a woman unexpectedly pouring costly perfume upon Jesus as he sits at dinner in someone’s home.  But in Matthew, Mark and John, the focus is on Jesus’ disciples who are appalled at this wastefulness and are making quite a reasonable ruckus about how the money could have gone to help the poor.  Jesus makes a rather enigmatic reference to the poor always being with them, but that they will not always have him.   In each of these texts, the reader is pointed ahead to the event that both reader and author anticipate: Jesus crucifixion and burial.\\nBut Luke is doing something different with the narrative as he tells it; his agenda is always on Jesus’ outreach to the marginalized as a sign of God’s Kingdom breaking through in the present, right in front of our eyes.   As Luke tells the story, our dinner guests would be reclining, waiting both for a lavish spread and for interesting philosophical discourse among other learned men.  They are there to drink, eat and debate, and would have be startled by the woman’s sudden appearance.  But she is not a table server nor an entertaining dancing girl.  Luke says she was a sinner, which has led to considerable lascivious debate about the possible sexualized nature of her sins, but the text is ultimately silent on this matter.  Feminist scholars have noted that traditional male commentators have not debated the sins of Peter, one of Jesus’ early disciples, even when he confesses to be a sinner himself.  Why all the attention on this woman’s presumed exotic occupational life?  She could have been a sinner, which meant ritually unclean, for any number of reasons in that culture.  Maybe she had a physical deformity.  Maybe she stole from her neighbor or poisoned her husband.   We don’t know!  \\nWhat would it have been like to be in the room that night and watch her do this?  Standing behind Jesus reclined body, she weeps copiously, her tears fall on his feet, she wipes them with her hair, pours oil on his feet and kisses them.  The intimacy of this interaction would have made me want to cover my eyes or even leave the room.   I wonder if her silent outburst at Jesus feet is so discomforting, that we have needed to dismiss her as far away as possible. Her emotions are so dramatically revealed and her actions are so unabashedly physical and sensual.  Not sexual, but sensual.  She needs to be someone very separate from us in our own righteousness.  Hence, a prostitute. But women let their hair down for a number of reasons…yes, enticement, is surely one of them.  But also is shame and grief.  \\nDid she already know Jesus?  Again, the narrative does not say.  There is such boldness and intimacy in their encounter it is difficult to imagine they are total strangers.  But my sense is that as she silently approaches Jesus, everything inside of her collides.  Judgment and confession and absolution and forgiveness all wordlessly tumble together.  The silent approach, tears stinging her eyes and flowing down her checks uncontrollably, opening the jar and pouring, the wiping of the feet.  If in our efforts to make sense of Apostle Paul’s description of justification by faith in Jesus Christ, we need only to look here at this woman.  Whatever her sins, she had a bodily knowing that Jesus sees her, yes judges her, understands her, forgives her, accepts her, welcomes her.   In deep, life-changing way, this woman has been transformed.  \\n\\tBut Simon the Pharisee is also in the room, and his blood is starting to boil.  His judging is of a different sort, done from his person sense of his own righteousness and distance from those who are sinners, outcasts, marginalized in his world.  This woman’s actions are an unseemly disruption in his carefully planned evening with the intriguing young rabbi. Simon seethes indignantly to himself, silently questioning Jesus’ identity and status as a prophetic figure.  “Gracious, the man is actually letting this unclean woman touch him!  Clearly he is no prophet!”  Jesus, ever the intuitive, reads Simons consternation and calmly outlines a parable regarding the cancellation of small and large debts.   And then turning his gaze towards the woman, he asks Simon, “do you see this woman?”  Do. You. Even. See. Her?    \\n\\n\\tThe Apostle Paul will later write in a letter in a letter to the early Christians in Galatia:  “It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.”  We have the spirit of the living Jesus Christ abiding within us, explains Paul.  I find this both challenging and intriguing; that if I pay attention, I can hear with Jesus’ ears and understanding.  If I open my awareness, pay attention and focus, I can see with Jesus’ eyes and compassion.  The word compassion actually means for our “guts to churn.”  It is in us, this ability see with his eyes, to feel with his guts even.  This is extraordinary.  And good gracious, this is burdensome!   Sometimes we see the hurts and needs of a friend or family member and we don’t know what to do.  We hear about frantic refugees from the middle east and north Africa climbing into flimsy liferafts, and we groan inwardly for the lost and the survivors.  Escalating violence in hotspots throughout the world; we start wondering and thinking together about what piece of this is about us and what do we do next?  It feels burdensome and overwhelming to keep paying attention.\\n\\t Part of what we do is to bring these burdens of sight, of seeing with the eyes of the Risen Jesus Christ, to worship, to our church.  We come to this place where we work together on envisioning new possibilities.  And perhaps even more poignantly, we begin might begin to see each other within community with Jesus eyes.  The person we disagreed with over a Board decision; the person we will never see eye-to-eye with about the treatment of a previous pastor.  What do Jesus’ eyes see when his living spirit looks at these people we really would, frankly, rather not see again?\\n\\t“Do you see this woman?” Jesus asked Simon the Pharisee.  Do I see the transformation, the inherent goodness, the belovedness preciousness of the people around me?  This seeing is both a joy and a deep responsibilitity.  No wonder we need to study and pray and think together as a community of faith.   For this ability to see with Jesus’ eyes, I give thanks to God. Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHere we are on History Sunday, perhaps wondering how God’s spirit might be praying inside of each of us.  The early apostle Paul wrote these words of encouragement to his friends in the new and conflicted church in Rome, mid first century.  As we hear the portion of his letter, we might find ourselves questioning: given all that has happened in our congregation over the last few years, and stretching back to other church conflicts here, do “all things really work together for good?”   How is it that God might somehow be using all the misunderstandings, disagreements, unresolved conflicts, betrayals, hurts and bewilderment that have been experienced by some in this congregation…and is working them together for good?\\n\\tI am not saying that I think God caused all these things to happen.  I don’t imagine that God sits at a giant control panel in the sky, like a at big computer and planning awful things to happen in our lives.  “Here, let me send as earthquake, or make someone sick, or I’ll start messy church conflict over here,” But we live in an imperfect world, where mistakes are made, disasters happen and people hurt each other.   What is the way IN for us to consider that God is working this situation for the good?\\n\\tI think we have a beginning opportunity today, as we share the joys and challenges, the blessings and disappointments, of being part of this church together over the years.  We may even find that in spite of different experiences and different points of view, we probably have all experienced some loss.  Loss of a trusted and beloved pastor OR loss of a chance to have a pastor you respected.   Loss of a way the church was in years past, loss of fellow members and friends who have left, loss of an anticipated future as a vibrant, growing congregation.  Loss of people in our pews who have died.  Perhaps we can each begin to acknowledge that ALL have lost something, and, that we do share that experience in common.  Knowing someone else is grieving has a way of softening my own heart, if I can sit quiet and just listen.  I’m reminded of the losses in my own life, and if I am brave enough and willing, I get another chance to embrace my own experiences and feelings in a new way.  We get to do this In the companionship of fellow traveler, on this journey where change and disappointment and loss are part of the life God offers us.  \\nIn a few moments, as you gather in small groups and begin listening carefully to one another, be aware of the losses that are being shared.  Be in solidarity with one another, not because you agree about the facts as described, who=did-or-said-what, but because we all share the common bond of loss.  In that sharing, we may begin to notion God’s Spirit praying within us with sighs too deep for words.  We may begin to see how God is working at renewing, refashioning and rebuilding us as a church.  We get to be partners with God in this healing process or God working all things for good among us.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n ',\n",
       " '\\tThis passage is the apostle Paul at some of his more convoluted letter-writing!  “Christ crucified, secret and hidden wisdom, spiritual, non-spiritual, mind of Christ,” where is he going here?  Paul was a Greek-speaking Jew, schooled in the Torah and a stanch Pharisee interpreter of Jewish law.  He never met Jesus during Jesus’ earthly ministry, but got it in his craw that the post-Resurrection Christians were a bunch of dangerous crack-pots.  Paul contended that followers of the Way had misinterpreted what a Messiah was, were a threat to Jewish identity and religious practice, and needed to be stopped.  Paul kept busy harassing and arresting followers of the Risen Jesus Christ, kicking these Jewish Christians out of the synagogues, in and around Jerusalem.  One day when traveling between towns, he heard an other-worldly voice demanding, “Paul, why are you persecuting me?”  He immediately went blind and fell off his horse.  He was brought home and tended compassionately and welcomed into community by a bunch of these same early Christians he had been persecuting.  Paul was profoundly moved by this experience of forgiveness, acceptance, the mutual respect and equality between diverse members of the Christian community.  His thinking and feelings transforming, Paul too began a follower of the Way.  And he began to share the Good News of the emergence of the new age, the coming of the kingdom of God in mercy and justice and peace, through the Spirit of the Risen Jesus, with people all over the Roman empire: from his hometown Tarsis, throughout Asia Minor, Greece and finally into Rome.  \\n\\tBeing both a strong Jew, schooled in the law and the prophets, as well as a Greek-speaking speaking Roman citizen he also was educated in Greek philosophy of the day.  He had quite the knack for interpreting the teachings and reality of the Risen Jesus Christ, to both Jews and also to the gentile Greek and Roman communities.\\n\\tHe was a prolific letter-writers, and corresponded with numberous churches he had established between the 30’s-50’s CE.  His letters were passed around from church to church; quite a few of his letters survived and make up a good portion of the New Testament.   What we have here is a portion of his First Letter to the Corinthians. He is addressing this church in Corinth where there had been much faithfulness, good work….. and considerable conflict in their congregation.  Divided into factions following different charismatic leaders.  He challenged the congregation to stop bickering and join in a unity of mind and purpose.  In today’s portion, he tells them how to get there.  Or, how to realize they are there, already.  That’s the part that makes this reading sound a little loopy.  It’s one of those “be who you are” messages that aren’t always explained well through rational linear discourse.  \\n\\tWhen Jesus would describe a paradoxical concepts, like the first shall be last and the last shall be first, he would often tell a parable, a story, to illustrate this perplexing teaching.  But not Paul! He kind of rambles around, swooping back and forth through cultural references and theological concepts that sound foreign and confusing to us. And, to complicate things ever more, we are only hearing one side of this conversation.  \\n\\tBut there is some meat for us here, and the early Church recognized this and pulled the letters into the canon of writings we now call the Bible. How do you and I live as a follower of Jesus, in these days of such division and rapid changes?  There spiritual nourishment and challenge in Paul’s writings, but we have to dig deep.  \\t\\n\\tFirst of all, it helps to get a sense of the historical context.  This letter is dated some 20 years after Jesus was killed in mid-30’s CE.  Archeologists and historians know that Corinth in mid-first-century was a busy commercial city, in southern Greece, situated on an isthmus strip of land bordered by natural harbors leading into two different seas on both sides (Bornkahm p. 68-69).  Big trading and sea-faring center with lots of sailors moving through and looking to go ashore and whoop-it-up. Lots of grand public buildings: temples, libraries public baths, theaters, stadiums.  Strong tradition of education, Greek philosophy and formal public oratory.  \\n\\tThis section starts with Paul describing how he decided to “know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.”  He speaks of this in other letters, to other young churches, “preaching only Christ crucified.”  Think for a minute about how you understand the crucifixion of Christ.  Let you eyes rest on this part of the stained glass window up here.  These words, Christ crucified, can make progressive, even mainline, Christians a tad uncomfortable.   Especially if it is followed up with references to sins being washed in Jesus’ blood or some other form of blood-price sacrifice language related to his death on a cross.  Helpful to remember crucifixtion was a common form of Roman execution, and that Jesus was killed by the Roman empire, and not the Jewish leaders nor people.  But what is Paul getting at?  \\n\\tApparently some the Corinthians had gotten a bit caught up with dramatic displays of the Spirit, flashy miracles and speaking in tongues or fancy powers of oration.  Paul seems to be saying, look you all, I approached you in a simpler, humbler manner.  He is linking the cross with terminology about seeing, a change of mind, of transformation (working preacher, 2/2017). “Christ crucified” is not “what Paul sees but how he sees.”  It’s like a lens between Paul’s eye and the world.  It’s shorthand for “God’s intervention in this age….where status, distinctions between male and female, slave and free, Jew and gentile, rich and poor, no longer hold.”  \\n \\tNot a bad idea to reflect occasionally on the lens-through-which-we-see the word:  what’s your lens these days?  Glass half-empty, half-full?  The world is a gracious, abundant place?  The world is a dangerous place?  All Muslims are out to get us?  All immigrants are suspect?  \\n\\tIn Paul’s time, the Jewish lens included the assumption that God’s Messiah would re-instate the political and social power of the Jewish people by defeating the Romans.  This hadn’t happened; many could not accept that Jesus ushered in the reign of God’s justice and mercy.  But another lens was this idea from their prophets, that the Messiah would come as a suffering servant, and would initiate God’s new age through “self-emptying and self-giving love.”  Through servanthood.  This becomes what Paul calls a “stumbling block” for many Jews.  The Greeks just found it to be weird.  Why would you want to follow the teachings of someone who let’s himself get tortured and killed.  That’s a foolhardy lens to hold up and use for interpreting the world!  \\n\\tPaul writes to the Cornithian church”  I didn’t come and blow you away with complex oratory, rational enumeration of all the reasons you should pay attention to Jesus and his teachings.  No, I only came and talked about this one who fully surrendered his life to God’s direction, so fully let go of his own ego needs and agenda in service to God’s people, so emptied himself out, that he ended up facing the ultimate consequence: torture and death.\\nFor Paul, there is a differernt way of seeing the world and of being in the world, that is in contrast with our predominant culture.  Paradoxically, God’s power comes to us most clearly in vulnerability, in weakness….not in strength, competitiveness or defensiveness.   Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek, those who hunger for righteousness, we read in Jesus’ words last week. “Now we have received not the spirit of the world,” continues Paul, “but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.”  Gifts bestowed on us….”you are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world.”  But how do we know this, we ask?  Your very consciousness changing, says Paul, your lens is changing, and this is what is going to help you unify again as a congregation: together, you have the mind of Christ. \\nPaul’s words “call us up short as to what we are actually supposed to be doing on this path (as followers of Jesus): (we are not to be) just admiring Jesus, but acquiring his consciousness….” (Cynthia Bourgeault, Wisdom Jesus)  Apparently, following Jesus is not just about helping others like he did. We are supposed to acquire his consciousness, his way of perceiving the world.  Seeing with his eyes, learning to respond to the world from the same healing love.  We have to work at this part: daily prayer and meditation, deep pausing, soaking in scripture, we begin to literal take on the mind of Jesus Christ.  It re-wires the operating system of our brain; it changes out the lens through which we see the world. The Spirit thinking with and through us. \\nAs this inner “mind of Christ” slowly transforms us, our lives bring into focus the new creation that God is revealing through the Spirit. It allows us to “imagine a new creation” - God’s reign of justice, compassion and peace, and to “participate in it even before it has come into focus for the rest of the world.”  We react less reflexively out of fear and anxiety, where we see the world divided between us and them.  It’s a different lens through which we can start to view the world and it’s creative possibilities. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t \\n',\n",
       " ' EXPLORING OUR EXPECTATIONS OF OUR NEW PASTOR\\n\\n\\tIn a few minutes, your Pastoral Search Committee will welcome you into the Gathering Room for some guided conversations.  They want to hear about your hopes and expectations of your new Pastor.  \\n\\n\\tPerhaps you have heard the story of the “perfect” pastor?   This person has the energy and vitality of a 25 year old, combined with about 35 years of ministry experience.   A real people-person, the perfect pastor is always available in the church office, but spends most of the time out visiting people, and connecting the church to the wider community.   \\n\\n\\tDepending on age generation you identify with, the perfect pastor may still be male.  Heterosexual male.  The perfect pastor is certainly not out on the dating scene, but is in a calm, low-maintenance marriage that seldom requires being home for dinner and in the evening.  The pastor has a couple of well-behaved, self-sufficient kids and a stay-at-home wife who volunteers for all sorts of things at church.   But somehow she also works full-time, and her health care benefits package covers the whole family!  Sort of a1950’s style pastor for a 2016 church. \\n\\n\\tEven if this leader is a woman, the perfect pastor is somehow “all things to all people,” leads appealing programming for the Millennials and young families, and spends most of her time with church elders, tender end-of-life issues, skilled nursing and hospital visits.  “The perfect pastor knows what I am thinking, without me saying it,” we might say to ourselves.  “He preaches sermons that give me answers to tough questions but doesn’t push his own view.  She speaks out for social justice but without ruffling any feathers….and never sounds political.”  Okay, I’ll stop now!\\n\\n\\tDebates about perfect pastoral leadership have been going on for a long time, going back to the beginning of the early church. Certain men and women emerged with gifts for leading and guiding the people following Jesus’ Way.  In this passage from the Letter to the Ephesians, we hear the early church leader, Paul, describe some of the gifts of ministry that he saw among these leaders.  Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.  These last two gifts, of being pastors and teachers, are the two roles United Church of Christ clergy promise to bring into our ministry when we are ordained.  Paul says an interesting thing about these gifts of ministry:  they are not for entertainment purposes, obviously, nor are they for the personal comfort of those ministered to.  God gives gifts of ministry in order to “equip the saints for the work of ministry.”  Who are the saints?  For Paul, that was everyone who sought to follow the Way of Jesus.   That would be all of us.  Not just the perfect people, but all of us imperfect people.  Saints who are sinners.  My gift and my job as your pastor, a saint and a sinner like you, is to equip you for the work of ministry.   \\n\\n\\tWhat is the ministry? Notice that it is not my gift or my role to do the work of ministry.  Or more bluntly: It’s not my job to be a Christian for you.  The job of your clergy leader is to equip, train-up, encourage, empower you to do the work of the Risen Christ’s ministry here, in your daily lives, in this time.    To help you deepen your sense of connection with the God of the Universe, to help you grow in trust of God, and to follow the teachings and Living Spirit of Jesus Christ.  To enable you to better be about sharing God’s love and healing in the world. \\n\\n\\t    Here’s the question for today’s discussion:  What kind of equipping do you need?  How do you want your new pastor to do this?  Particularly in our worship life together, in liturgy and sermons, in our study groups and discussions, what do you need from a pastor and teacher among you?  What works best for you, to equip you for the work of ministry in the world?  May God bless and guide our conversations together.\\n \\n',\n",
       " '\\tOnly the Gospel writer Luke includes this strange parable about prayer.  The context for the story is a conversation Jesus is having with his close followers, and probably overhead by other curious bystanders, including local religious leaders.  Jesus has just given everyone an earful with some rather omminous sounding apocalypitic predictions about the end times.  His listeners are understandably unnerved, and so he tells them this cautionary story about a needy widow and a unjust judge.  It’s a parable about their need “to pray always and not to lose heart,” says Luke as he introduces the story.  \\n\\tIt’s a peculiar story that seems to imply if we pester God enough, we will get what we want.  Well, what do you think?  We may need enter “side-ways” in order to understand Jesus’ meaning here.  I suggest we start by hearing another story from an unknown author; this one about two frogs:  \\nTwo frogs fell into a deep cream bowl;\\nThe one was wise, and a cheery soul.\\nThe other one took a gloomy view\\nAnd slipped beneath the surface, hopeless and blue.\\nSaid the other frog with a merry grin,\\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"\\nAnd as he swam, though ever it seemed,\\nHis struggling began to churn the cream\\nUntil on top of pure butter he stopped,\\nAnd out of the bowl he quickly hopped.\\nThe moral, you ask? Oh, it\\'s easily found!\\nIf you can\\'t get out, keep swimming around.  (Author Unknown) \\u2028\\xa0\\nWhen we fall into a mess, don’t we just wish it was sweet cream!   The point of this silly cautionary tale, however, is that the frog’s continual swimming caused something new to happen, and saved his neck.  Through his ongoing persistent actions, something changed in the cream bowl, in the environment around him.  He didn’t just loose heart, give up, and blub blub let himself drown.   Any child knows the general flow of this kind of story:  The hard-working ant contrasted with the lazy grasshopper in Aesop’s fables; the “little engine that could”  - “I think I can, I think I can” - who finally makes it up the huge hill.   And here, in Luke’s gospel today, the story of the feisty widow who keeps at it, persistently demanding that this unjust judge hear her case.  \\n“How much more will your just and loving God answer your prayers?” Jesus demands of his listeners.  It’s a contrast story, with almost absurd charactures:  vulnerable, powerless widow with no legal rights in her society, claiming that she will sock this judge in the eye (literal reading of “wear me out”) if he doesn’t hear her case.  A grumpy and arbitrary judge, who by Jewish law is required specifically to defend the rights of orphans and widows, here ignoring the woman’s request for justice in what is probably a financial or property claim.   \\nIf we aren’t careful, we might equate God with the judge in the story.  One Biblical commentator has noted that, in doing this, God becomes someone who really “doesn’t care and needs to be irritated before relenting” (William Loader, Uniting Church of Australia website, Pentecost 21).   We might wonder if we are to pray and pray and pray, to keep bugging God about our needs, like a child might pester a reluctant parent. Like Bart and Lisa Simpson repeatedly asking, “please Dad, please Dad, please Dad.”  Is it our job to somehow rattle God out of a stinginess, an aloofness, or that we have to do a lot to get God’s attention?  I don’t know about you, but I’m not interested in a God who has to be persuaded and cajoled into helping humanity.  This image just doesn’t fit with the Biblical narrative of an attentive Creator God who sees the sparrow fall out of the tree and counts the hairs on our heads.  \\nPersistence in the practice of prayer is something more than pestering God for goodies.  Returning to my story about the two frogs who fell in the cream; it is the frog who keeps swimming, who keeps moving and engaging with the stuff around him, who finds his world changing. .  Daily conversation with God slowly changes both us and the spaces around us.  There is something about our back and forth exchanges with God, as we express our thanks, our frustrations, our sadness, our anger, our wonderings, that begins to transform the world around us and begins to even change us.   \\nOur challenge in the 21st century is to build a supportive, encouraging, Biblically based faith community which is persistent in both prayer and scripture reading. Reading, meditating upon, soaking in God’s word becomes part of a dialogue between us, our Biblical ancestors and the Holy Spirit moving in our midst.  This is the foundation that makes our outreach and mission work possible and effective.  Persistent prayer and scripture soaking help us decide which of the overwhelming social action needs we should address together.\\nI no longer assume that everyone knows how to do this, how to pray or read scriptures, or that they were taught this in their homes.  During this interim period, we have been exploring new ways to be together in prayer, be it in church business meetings or fellowship groups.  We are experimenting with different opportunities to soak in the scriptures together.  How might we better support our families in teaching their children these practices, in their jobs as the primary faith incubators of our church children?  How might we put a system in place that helps parents keep the promises they make, and that we make as a congregation, when we baptize our babies?  What other ways can we provide more spaces where people can encounter God in prayer and scripture, and come to know each other more intimately in the doing?   Because this is how we become transformed and equipped for God’s work in the world.  \\nSometimes I guess we would rather that life, even church, was more like a cozy and predictable circle.  A part of us longs to stay in the middle of such a circle and gather our loved ones and comforts around us.  But I heard someone note the other day, “you know, Jesus did not say, come gather around me….Jesus said, come follow me!”  The ongoing action, the “swimming” in the practices of prayer and scripture reading transform us and equip us for that following. The frog in the cream knew this; he was wise and had a cheery soul, in part because he kept swimming. \\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"  \\nWe might even die in the course of this faith journey, but the frog reminds us not to give in – not to despair, or loose heart.  We pray, steep ourselves in God’s word and offer acts of love and justice until our strength is spent, and contentment is ours.  And in the midst of our persistence, through our acts of healing and kindness, the world around us is changed.  Butter starts to form where there once was cream, and all kinds of new possibilities emerge!  Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tJesus speaks these words from the Gospel of John at the end of the Last Supper.  His betrayer Judas has already left the room.  Jesus has shared a meal with his followers.  He has lifted some bread and a cup of wine, and has said some curious words about these being his body and blood.  He told them that they should keep sharing in this meal, taking in his symbolic presence after he is gone.  The disciples are eyeing each other, perhaps whispering among themselves:  what is Jesus talking about?  This is weird.  Is he leaving?  And now, right before heading out to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray, Jesus starts speaking about grapevines.  He describes branches, fruit of the vine.  He speaks of One who tends the vine.\\n\\n\\tI find this to be a beautifully tender image, and also unsettling.  I can picture a vast vineyard, lush with green leaves flashing under the sunshine and big bunches of glowing, red grapes.  An image of abundance, the promise of harvest and the liveliness of full-bodied wine to come.  Jesus speaks of himself as the vine, the center of all this growth and fruitfulness, with roots deep in the earth and trunk twisting up towards the sun.  We are the branches, and as we abide, stay connected to the vine, we are able to bear fruit.  To produce all kinds of goodness and fullness in our lives.  Where’s God in all this?  Well, this is the unsettling part for me.  Jesus says that God is the vine grower.  The one who tends the vine.  The person who prunes the vine.  I see, in my mind’s eye, that vineyard in late fall, after the grapes are gone and the leaves have fallen.  The gnarly vines are bare.  I see people with pruning scissors moving along the vines, cutting away branches, piling them up, burning them.  Smoke fills the autumn air and the branches are reduced to ash.  God is someone who prunes us?  Yes, Jesus.  Apparently, we need it.\\n\\n\\tThis image is so opposed to our predominant culture that says we can “go it alone.”  That insists that growing up is about learning to be independent.  That tells us our self-worth is attached to our accomplishments.  That insists that we will “bear fruit” by some how just squeezing it out of ourselves.  That says we are self-actualized by striking out on our own, as an autonomous individual.  But Jesus says that we become most fruitful, according to God’s purposes, when we “abide” in him, when we continue to “dwell” in his presence, his guidance and direction.   There is something in here about dependence and that makes most of us pretty nervous.  \\n\\n\\tI think it takes a lifetime to fully understand this journey of abiding in Jesus.   Of allowing God to slowly prune away the parts of us that no longer serve, that no longer help us become the person God hopes we might be.   We worry that this pruning is about judgment.  I don’t think it is.  Growing up into adulthood isn’t just about independence and going it alone.   This is what is so compelling about the vine metaphor to me.  I bear fruit in my life as I stay connected to the vine.  Inter-dependent with the vine, I absorb the sunshine through my leaves, and the whole vine is nourished as my leaves transform that sunlight into food and send it through the rest of the vine.  I am nourished, in turn, by the moisture and minerals that come up from the ground through the roots and the trunk.  I bear fruit in my life as I remain inter-dependent with the vine.  Somehow it is about sinking into a mutuality, a reciprocal connecting.  Between each of us and other people.  Between each of us and God’s living presence within us.  \\n\\n\\tAbide in me as I abide in you, said Jesus.  May it be so.  Amen.\\n\\t ',\n",
       " '\\nTHE KINGDOM OF GOD’S GOOD PLEASURE\\nSermon Series on the Lord’s Prayer – Part 2\\n\\n\\nAs the saying goes, different people really do approach life differently:  Some see life, events around them, as a “half-empty glass” and some see it  “half-full.” I wonder how life seems to you this morning?  As you take a broad view, beyond your own daily encounters, do things seem to be getting better or are things getting worse in human history?  This question hasn’t just perplexed our contemporary world.  Beginning about the mid-second century before Jesus birth, Biblical writers came up with a unique version of “glass half empty or half full.”  They started claiming that the glass of human history was actually “cracked” and desperately in need of repair.  Their people were repeatedly under siege or conquered.  At that time, visions recorded in Book of Daniel described how the four preceding empires were like beasts rising “up out of the sea” from the watery chaos of the Med Sea.  Four powerful, violent and seemingly permanent imperial kingdoms had conquered Israel since its glory days under King David:  Babylonians carted the population off into exile, destroying the Temple and Jerusalem; when the Jews finally returned, they were conquered by the Medes, then Persians, then Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Greek.  \\n\\tAccording to Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan, Daniel is one of the first to articulate how the “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.”  It will be a different reign than that of the beasts that have preceeded it, who “devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces (Daniel 7).  God’s kingdom or reign will be personified not by beasts but by a person, the “son of man,” or as Crossin describes: “a transcendental Human one who has been entrusted with (the Kingdom) by God, the transcendent Ancient One.   The kingdom will be given to this “son of man” for the benefit of all humans.  This is the start of the vision of tikkun olam, the Hebrew words for “healing the world.  And eventually Jesus will use this title, “son of man,” “son of the human one,” to describe his own purpose.\\n\\tWhen we move to Jesus time, and Israel is under the thumb of a “beast” of proportions that Daniel never could have imagined: the Roman Empire.  Daniel’s visions and this new Roman imperialist rule are the context for Jesus’ self-understanding, his teachings and his ministry.  Our current and treasured divisions between politics and religion are frankly too simplistic to understand how Jesus invisioned the cracks in the glass being mended, world being healed.  For Jesus, God’s kingdom wasn’t a place (like up in heaven), it was more a verb – God’s reigning in a different manner than corrupt human rulers.  Last week we explored the opening parts of the Lord’s prayer, and I offered the image of God being like a Householder, the parental leader over a large, multigenerational estate.   I suggested that Jesus understood God to be the head Householder, taking loving and just care of everyone, where there was peace and everyone was to have enough, The frail and vulnerable, and the needy were to get special attention. \\n\\tThis vision had always been around in Jewish tradition, but often became the minority voice. The eight century BCE prophet prophet Micah told the corrupt king of his time: In days to come the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established…and peoples shall stream to it, and the many nations shall come…They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.  Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more..  By the time Jesus arrives on the scene, Rome’s imperial power is enabling none of this vision.  The Jewish people are aching for God’s kingdom to come and God’s will to be done.   Where is God’s just and redemptive reign in all this they ask?  There are plenty of people in the world right now asking this question: from violent hot spots of Syria and Egypt  to U.S. children living in poverty who face the possible demise of the public foodstamps program that feeds them through a hot summer of no subsidized school breakfasts and lunches.  This precious glass of human history is still cracked and leaking from what I can tell.\\nSo Jesus taught his followers to pray like this: May your kingdom come and your will be done, here on earth as it is in heaven. \\nThis kingdom language may seem a bit strange for us in this country.  Our nation’s founders were very much opposed to any kind of monarchy or absolute rule of a king or queen.  We live in and celebrate our participatory democracy.\\n\\tThe Hebrew people in Old Testament times did not have a very good experience of kings and kingdoms either.  These were independent tribal clans, constantly on the move with their flocks and families. Years later, after the Jews fled Pharaoh’s oppressive reign in Egypt, they were not too keen on a king with absolute power.  They built a community based on their covenant with God:  know most intimately with the giving of the Law on Sinai.  “God alone was their leader; they were to be different from other nations and empires in Mesopotamia.” (Walter Wink). And within that covenant agreement, they agreed to follow God’s laws which taught an unusual sharing of power and resources among the people. \\n\\tWhile Israel sometimes ignored these laws, the intent was for as little disparity as possible between the rich and the poor. Archaeologists have even found that their houses, up until the time of the monarchy period, were pretty much the same modest size.  But after the monarchy period starts in 1020 with King Saul, archaeologists have found an increasing array of palatial dwellings and as well as hovels (p. 10, Crossin). Eventually later prophets start proclaiming that now Israel looks much like all the other foreign powers through history…power hungry, vast economic disparity among the people, not caring for the poor and marginalized in their midst.  I find there is something chillingly familiar and relevant about this critique. \\n\\tSo what did Jesus mean by “the Kingdom of God?”  He seems to have been picking up on the prophets’ call for a return to God’s reign, style of ruling. Jesus was not just talking about some interior moral kingdom in our hearts; and this is were we get distracted in our life together as Christians.  Yes, he taught that “the KOG is within you,” yet he also described a world in which equality and fairness and compassion rule.  And this world would come about not with violence, like the imperial beasts of Daniel’s time or Rome’s military might.  It’s power would come through non-violence.  Ironically, Jesus gets into trouble because his preaching is a direct challenge to all kinds of domination systems of his day, be they the violent, repressive rule of the Roman Empire or the systems of privilege and prestige within his own religious tradition.\\n\\tAs we consider the final phrase of today’s portion, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, pause a moment on that word “will.”  God’s will.  How does it resonate within you?  Some Christians will talk about “God’s will for your life” like it is a pre-set blueprint.  And it sounds harsh, judgemental even and probably not much fun.  We reduce “God’s will” to individual morality, or expand it far enough to say it is “God’s will” that a certain battle or war be won for our side.  But it is God’s will that the world be healed.  In fact, according to Crossin’s research, the word “will” here actually means, “good will or good pleasure.” It is God’s good pleasure, God’s wish or deep yearning, for us to be living differently: in harmony, equality and peace.  That is God’s will. \\n\\tThe Kingdom of God, God’s will done among God’s people on earth….it is happening and it is not fully happening yet.  So pray for it, says Jesus.  Pray for it with all your heart.   But look out!  Contemporary author Kathleen Norris has observed that “Prayer is not asking for what you think you want, but asking to be changed in ways you can’t imagine.” (Anne Lamont quoting Kathleen Norris)   Prayer takes on a decidedly radical, even risky, flavor when I think about this.  “Prayer is asking to be changed in ways I can’t imagine.”   Part of Jesus’ uniqueness was introducing this different paradigm through which to understand God:  God doesn’t swoop in and intervene.  God calls us to collaborate with God, partner with God’s good pleasure.\\n\\tSo, in this second part of the Lord’s Prayer, we are asking that God to change us into Kingdom partners, co-workers with God.  Do this and unexpected things are going to start happening in our lives.   We are going to start seeing ourselves and other people differently, perceptions will start to shift and new thoughts and images will come to us.  Our vision of what it means to be a Christian, to be a church, to be a witness for Jesus in this community may start to change. \\n\\tSo, let’s watch this week for ways we are called to be a Kingdom partners. Pray like this:  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  Amen.  \\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\tOur reading from John’s gospel brings us a celebratory, joyous story of about a wedding feast.  And who doesn’t like a great, big wedding reception?  Well, we all know it can be a tense time for whoever is paying for the bash; formal wear tends to feel constricting, neckties and highheels and such.  And relationships with the in-laws may feel prickly.   A few family members may still be fuming that the wedding ceremony was held on the beach or all places. Or that it incorporated elements from some other spiritual tradition.   Or that there were two brides instead of a bride and a groom for goodness sake!  Not to mention that at many receptions, somebody invariably drinks to much.  But usually, we all hang in there for an afternoon or evening of feasting and dancing, delighting in the couples love-glow and having a roaring good time.  And thank goodness, that most of our wedding receptions don’t go on for a week like they did in Jesus’ time.   Seems so over-the-top!\\n\\tFor some reason, the gospel writer John frames Jesus first public action with the context of an over-the-top wedding feast story.  It’s a rough beginning for us, as 21 century people, as it is easy to get stuck on the miracle question as we weave our way through the text.  Did it really happen like that?  Six huge 20-30 gallon jars of water turned into wine?  Even a cup of water shape-shifting into wine throws off our scientific sensibilities. Matter just doesn’t spontaneously change like that, according to our current laws of physics.  Unless of course we are replicating beverages on the Starship Enterprise, as suggested in the TV series Star Trek somewhere in the future.  But for now, we may struggle with whether or not this is literal or symbolic language.  Whatever it is, this story is John’s introduction to the public ministry and works of Jesus.  It is the inaugural story that John tells us about Jesus.  In the midst of a wedding celebration Jesus works a sign of such over-the-top extravagance that his disciples believe in him.  \\nBut what does the sign, this miracle, point to and what does it mean?  Just what do the disciples end up believing about him?   That Jesus, whoa, now THERE is one amazing wine-maker!? What does the Gospel writer hope will happen in us as we hear the story?  What’s the invitation here and how might we respond?\\n\\tWhen we are faced with a thorny Biblical story, it helps to consider the context in which we are encountering the narrative.  First, we hear it with some perspective on the author’s context: a late first century church where the struggle between new Jewish and Greek followers of Jesus, and the wider Jewish community that did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, was intensifying.  And we may bring our past awareness of the story with us, if we have heard it before. Now, such stories may irritate or hook us, make it hard to get at what the Gospel writer is really doing.  We also hear today’s story with the wider context of a current Inaugural celebration happening this weekend and the swearing in of our re-elected President for a second term tomorrow.   If we are citizens, however we voted, there is general assumption and civic agreement that we get on board with our re-elected leader.  That we get down to work together on bringing renewal, reduced violence, even peace, justice and mutually shared prosperity, to our country and the wider world.  That we do this respectfully and with open-mindedness.  And we attempt to move forward even as we commemorate the birthday of Martin Luther King Junior and acknowledging that we still have tremendous challenges ahead in addressing the racism and poverty he so deplored.  A tall order in our sharply divided nation. But even with our cynicism and despair over current public rancor, that is our hope and intention.   Might we be hearing today’s Biblical texts with ears attuned to new beginnings, a new era where these values, the values of God’s reign of peace and justice, are freshly embraced and fulfilled?  \\n \\tJohn’s story of a marriage feast and abundant wine draws on ancient Biblical symbols of the joyous arrival of God’s reign among the people.  For all that has happened in the last weeks, from school shootings to vitriolic debate about reducing gun violence to the news of a hostage massacre in Alegria, the Biblical word remains among us:  God is hughly generous and God’s reign of extragence is breaking in upon us.   As the prophet Isaiah describes it, where once the Jewish nation was called “Forsaken” and “Desolate,” they will now be called God’s “Delight” and their land will be called “Married.”  Are these Biblical writers dense?  Their historical era was no picnic. Weren’t they aware of the violence and poverty and suffering all around them?  \\n\\tJesus, his mother and some of his early followers are at this wedding.  And this is day three of feasting and drinking.  Jesus was known for enjoying a good party.  This story may bring us equal amounts of the human Jesus, as well as his divine powers and glory.  Actually, John starts by telling us Jesus’ mother was there, which is a curious detail.  But she will be one of the few faithful disciples John describes as being at the foot of the cross when Jesus is executed.  Here she is named only as his mother, but her attention to detail jump-starts the story of his public ministry.  Even before the wine-steward has spoken to the party host, the bridegroom, Mary is on to it.  Pulling Jesus aside, she whispers, “they have no wine.”  His reply sounds harsh, but in the original tongue of Aramaic it not rudeness but neutral disengagement.  “Woman, of what concern is that to you and me?  My hour has not yet come.”  Bells would go off in John’s early readers with this word:  “hour.”  Like marriage feasts and good wine, “the hour” was a common Jewish metaphor of escatological fulfillment.  The future end time when God’s justice would rule the world in peace and well-being for all.   “Not yet,” Jesus is saying.  Is he reluctant, or just being timely, according to God’s plan?  We don’t know.  But what happens next is that the faithful disciple, his mother, initiates a subtle protest and a blatant nudge.  She turns to the servers, saying: “do whatever he tells you.”   I love this part.  Maybe part of what we are to do as followers is to trust that God wants our joy and delight, symbolized by the wine.  Are we all called to sometimes protest and to nudge God?  \\n\\tSix big stone containers, 20-30 gallons each, used for Jewish rites of washing and purification.  All empty.  Is John symbolically telling us there is  emptiness in the religious practice of the day?  That something new needs to be added?  Notice how the details start to go over the top.  “Fill the jars with water,” Jesus directs the servants.  This is a massive amount of liquid. “And draw them out and take them to the chief steward.”  Which they do, and the oblivious guests are quite pleased because the wine is delicious.  The chief steward gets stuck where we do, trying to come up for a reason that explains the miracle of this tremendous vintage (he has got to know the wine ran-out):  “oh, I get it, you are SUCH a generous bridegroom, you have saved the best for last!  How wonderful!”  Actually, it is Jesus who is the new bridgegroom, coming to marry and fulfill humanity.  Only Jesus disciples, his mother and these other unnamed followers get it.  This sign, says John, is to reveal God’s glory and the breaking in of God’s reign.  And Jesus is the one who reveals this.  This is the one.  And the disciples believe it. \\nThe Biblical narrative challenges us with a vision of God’s forward motion in the history, God’s call to action to each of us.  And our call to keep talking with God, protesting to God amidst the brokenness of our world.  Like Mary bugging Jesus, to keep nudging God.  In these weeks of both disturbing news and renewed beginnnings for our country, I resonate with the Psalmist declaration that God’s steadfast love brings the people into an abundant feast where they “drink from the river of (God’s) delights.”  As Isaiah reminds us, and all shall be joined together again, our land “married.”  Jesus gallon creates over 150 gallons of wine: an extravagant almost senseless abundance.  Not unlike the pouring into Washington this week of people to witness this Inauguration and celebrate with together optimistic hopefulness.   But any vision worthy of God’s purposes is filled with the spilling over of both compassion and joy. How we might share God’s delight, God’s hope in us, with others?  For this challenge and this ministry, thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " \"This passage from Luke contains one of Jesus’ stranger stories.  It comes after the more understandable parables of the lost sheep, lost coin and the prodigal son story of a lost father-son relationship.  Is this a lost job story?  A tale of scrambling to save your lost prestige in the community?  A parable of loosing your honesty and getting praised for your shrewdness?  I’m part of a local pastors group that meets for scripture study each week.  We had a heck of a time trying to figure out what on earth Jesus was getting at.  So, let’s see what we can make of it!  Context: Jesus has been responding to the Pharisees, the Jewish legal scholars, who are harassing Jesus because he hangs out with tax collectors, sinners who break Jewish law and other marginalized people.  Instead of directly challenging people, Jesus often tells a parable.  These little stories are meant to unsettle people’s assumptions.  Give them a glimpse of the Kingdom, the Reign of God, from the perspective of God’s peculiar logic (David Lose phrase).  For starters, we might want to listen for the peculiar, the unexpected, the reversal of what we might expect.  \\n \\t “There was a rich man,” Jesus begins and everyone in the vicinity perks up.  (Apparently, fascination with the lives of the rich and famous is as old as the hills.)    And a rumor goes around that his estate manager has cheated him.  He confronts the manger and fires him…… But before the manger is released from his duties, he runs around trying to make good with his bosses debtors.  Interest rates were high and the manger appears to cut what people owe the manger, down to their original debt, cutting out interest due the master.  To secure his own future now that he no longer has a job?  He is eventually praised by the master for making friends by means of dishonest wealth.  This parable has confounded esteemed Biblical scholars down through the ages.  As I wrestled with the text, I was snagged on this last part about the impossibility of serving both God and wealth.  Is this a parable about who and what are we willing to serve in the normal transactions of our lives?  I found myself humming a snippet of a tune, repeating a refrain I couldn’t quite place:  “you gotta serve somebody” round and round in my head. Thank goodness for Internet search engines; there it was:\\nYou may be an ambassador to England or France,\\n\\nYou may like to gamble, you might like to dance,\\n\\nYou may be the heavyweight champion of the world,\\n\\nYou may be a socialite with a long string of pearls\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\\n                     \\nYou're gonna have to serve somebody,\\n      \\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody.\\n\\nBob Dylan in the late 1970’s, echoing, probably unintentionally, this ancient Biblical story about ultimate allegiance which guides daily decisions.   Uncannily, Dylan hits the issue spot-on:  Whoever you are, you end up sometimes unwittingly serving evil or good.  You don’t believe you have to chose? Dylan taunts.  Think again. \\n\\tWhat do our daily choices say about whom or what we serve?  What would my life really look like, or your life, if we could say “I serve God.” ?  Or put in specifically Christian terms: “I follow the Way of Jesus, that is how I serve God.” ?  Not just our dollars but what does our attention, our time, our daydreams, our appetites, our energies, our hopes actually serve?   It’s so everyday, this choice-making; it is easy to loose track of how “who we serve” is played out in our daily lives, choice by choice.  \\n\\t  Within the Hebrew language scriptures of Jesus’ time, there were various messages about money, wealth and poverty.  Faithfulness meant being generous.  The whole society was to take care of those living in poverty among them, the orphans, the widows, the needy in their midst.  It was considered a “mitzvah” or a blessing to do so.  Here’s why the prophet Amos is so critical of those who cheated the poor, who altered the weighing scales in the market so folks were ripped-off when their grain is measured out.     Not just individuals were to be generous and just; this was the job of the whole society to be fair and just.  Uncomfortable reminders for us, in a time when economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country is one of the causes of the vitriolic polarization across our nation.  Amos’ words cut into us, as we think about the huge disparities in access to proper health care, good schools, clean drinking water, fair-wage jobs, adequate housing.  \\t \\nBut Jesus’ story seems to careen off into an unexpected affirmation of shrewdness and dishonesty.  The manager proceeds to collect from several of his boss’s debtors, probably by reducing the interest money he as manager could receive and thereby remaining friends with his neighbors.  He is praised by the rich boss because of his ability to wisely read the situation he finds himself in and do something about it, and make his master look generous at the same time.\\nI can just picture the disciples looking at each other in confusion.  The previous stories about the lost were Jesus’ response to the charge that he consorted with sinners.  This story appears to be about sin that involves money, and the ongoing challenge of serving two masters, having both God and money in your life.  But what is Jesus doing here?  \\n\\tIn keeping with his own Jewishness, Jesus did not appear to think money was evil.  But it did teach that the use of money was as morally complicated. Jesus had an uncanny way of revealing that, as one Biblical commentator has noted, “how we relate to money is a barometer of how we relate to God.”  (Don Clendenin, 17C Blog)  The way I relate to money, the way I think about, worry about money and the way I handle my finances is a kind of measure of the mood, the atmospheric pressure we could say, between me and God.   Ouch.\\n\\tHere’s an another translation of Jesus’ comment at the end of the story:  “make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth so that when it is gone, the children of this age, may welcome you into their eternal tents” (is the actual translation).  Tents, not home; life on the move in God’s Kingdom, where one’s treasured position and possessions can change in a flash.  Maybe Jesus is pushing us to see that our very security lies elsewhere.  Could it be that the dishonest manager is praised because, in a crisis, he reaches out below himself, to those in debt to his boss?  In what way might connections between us and those on other rungs of the financial ladder be shrewd or wise?  Is Jesus reminding us that the rich and the poor are more connected then they know?  That our financial status can be fleeting, and we need to be careful not to cling to it?  Jesus speaks of life in a tent rather than a building like a home; unpredictable, ready to pick up and move as the Spirit leads.  Lots of questions to consider this week.  \\n\\tEach of our financial situations is different, but I invite us to keep re-visiting this text and see where it leads us this week.  As we handle our cash, write a check, take out a debit or credit card, let’s wonder about what makes us feel secure.  In what ways do we serve this notion of security; just who or what do we actually serve? Jesus is pretty blunt at the end of this passage.  We cannot serve God and wealth.   Most of us have not taken monastic vows of poverty; most of us are neither destitute nor extraordinarily wealthy.  We’re muddling through all this along some kind of middle way.  Jesus invites us to wonder and question about money, the possibilities and the challenges it brings to each of us.  And so might we pray and ponder in the days ahead.  Because “we're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed we're gonna have to serve somebody,  Amen. \\n\",\n",
       " '\\tThe industrious puppet King Herod has been hard at work transforming this place for over 30 years by the time these celebrants arrive.  A Jewish king dispised by his own people, Herod fawns for his Roman superiors.  Prestige and power are everything: he builds Palaces, citadels, amphitheatre, viaducts, public mounuments…and the hugely expanded Temple.  All to gain prominence and esteem in the eyes of occupying Roman Empire.   But grand and beautiful as it is, this is a city on edge.  Jerusalem residents and visitors alike are straining under the increasing tax burden and the offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Rome and its minions.  After several centuries of prosperity and autonomy following the Babylonian exile, times have changed.  Since Alexander the Great’s conquest in the 4th century BC, their spiritual home is now occupied by idolaters.  No one knew when a statue of a Greek or Roman god might be installed in the Temple, or when there would be new restrictions on the people’s ability to adhere to the Torah, their law and their joy. This is what it is like to live in an alienated homeland. With Roman occupation, the Jewish people become convinced that the government and major institutions sought to insidiously thwart their religious practices and destroy their way of life.   They longed for a restoration of automony, religious freedom, and justice.\\nThis is the Jerusalem Jesus and his disciples are approaching on what we now call Palm Sunday.  A Jerusalem where Jewish leaders are worried about stability and safety for their people and where Roman authorities are beefing up security.   Biblical scholars Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crosson have studied this period in Jerusalem’s history, and wrote a book entitled The Last Week:  What the Gospels Really Teach about Jesus’ Final Days in Jerusalem.  They suggest that there very well might have been two processions entering Jersualem on that fateful day.  This one we just heard about from the Gospel of Matthew:  One coming from the east, mostly peasant farmer types who have followed Jesus into town.  Jesus sitting astride a donkey and riding through one of the city gates.  The people crying out “Hosanna,” Aramaic for “save us, we pray.”  “Save us from what  we might wonder: ourselves, from sin, from the Romans?  One thing is clear:  everyday people are having a rough go and want things to change.  They are searching for meaning to their present suffering and hope for a changed future.  \\n\\tThe crowds wave palms, throw down cloaks and branches at Jesus feet, identifying him a Messiaic figure who will bring a new era of peace, justice….and vanquished Romans.   They want their Jerusalem and their Temple back and the Romans gone.\\n\\tBorg and Crosson suggest the possibility of another, simultaneous procession entering from the west, at the opposite end of the city:  the Roman governor of the region, Pontius Pilate and his entourage.  We might picture him summonded from his seaside villa in administrative capital at Caesarea Maritima by his Roman superiors.  I can’t imagine Pilate being very excited to make this inland journey (really, Pilate, you ought to get down there for the Festival of Passover! Bring a visible display of law and order to that city; place is crawling with rif-raf, brazen preachers and healers and possibily armed rebels lurking about; make a big statement Pilate - imperial calvary and tough-looking soliders and all that!).  \\n\\tWhat a contrast:  Through one gate, imperial power and might, swords and snapping flags, prancing steeds and armored soldiers.  Shock and Awe.  Impressive.  Through another gate, excited but weary commoners on foot, a preacher/healer man on a donkey.  Not so impressive.  \\nWe begin to get a sense of how Jesus’ audiences resonated with his preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  They would have understood him primarily through the lense and the longings of this very prevalent theology of restoration. It had evolved into a hope for universal renewal; restored Israel and morally transformed, non-idol worshipping Gentiles.  Prophetic visioning began to happen all over the place, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare, believed they were living in the last days, preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists,  all performing signs and wonders that were a signal both of their intimacy with God and as pointing to the End Times, all were common in this period.  Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  And his vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation.\\nSuddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he raises the dead, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   But Jesus doesn’t ride a horse, he rides a donkey.  In ancient Israel the Kings would ride a horse off to war, and a donkey to signify they came in peace.  This is the man who is to go head to head with the Roman powers?   \\nYears ago everyone seemed to be reading the book written by a Jewish rabbi “When Bad Things Happen to Good People.”  The author’s son had suffered terribly and died from a childhood disease.  When faced with such suffering, Rabbi Kushner questioned God’s reality.  He wrote that our claims about God can end up contradicting each other if we aren’t careful. He challenged the notion that God is both all loving and all powerful.  In Rabbi Kushner’s mind, God can’t be both.  How could all-powerful, all-lovingness, let people suffer?  Kushner leaned towards affirming God’s love and facing the fact that God appears to limit God’s power among us.   \\nSo what is God’s power really about?  Jesus rides in on a lowly donkey.  Pontius Pilate rides in on a huge mighty steed.  I would say that these are both power statements.  And there is something oddly subversive about this Jesus entry, if you ask me.  Or perhaps I should say, Jesus is purposely revealing the subversive nature of his own Kingship.  The real power, God’s power, is not about force, bigness, shock and awe….God’s power, God’s domain, is about Self-giving.  Empowering peace.  Compassion and Mercy.    \\nA few decades later, the early Christian teacher and apostle Paul will write a letter to his church at Philippi.  Reading through this short letter, one quickly gets a sense that this church had some serious internal power issues: Who gets to decide what, whose opinion matters the most, who wields the most influence in the congregation’s decisions.  Church conflict is apparently as old as the church!  In his letter to them, Paul encourages his people to “let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.”  We may hear this as:  now I want you all to agree on church doctrine and there will be no variation or theological diversity!”  I don’t think this is what Paul is describing.  We read on in the letter: Paul speaks of how Jesus “emptied himself.”  Paul says that Jesus,  “taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.” Does this reveal something to us about God’s power?  Perhaps God’s most powerful aspect is God’s self-giving to us, out of God’s Self?  A God who empties-out God-self for all that is not-God.  As in, creation, humanity, us. Have this kind of mind, of one self-emptying and humility among you.\\nOur lives do sometimes feel like an “alienated land” and we long for a sense of power, control, visible restoration.  We may miss the depths of the paradoxical kind of power which Jesus taught and enacted in his life.  Humbling, pouring ourselves out, almost seems counter-intuitive.  Yet God calls us to hope for and work for a changed future in this kind of servant mode.  I wonder how might we talk about these challenges in an even deeper way together at Emmaus.  What might this kind of self-emptying power look like among us, as we be church together?\\nThe ambiguity and turbulence of Holy Week brings complicated themes of life and death.  It confronts us again with the question of God’s powerful and restorative presence in the midst of human suffering. Always the realist, Jesus knew it is not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  There he is, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us; let us follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'BLESSED COMMUNITY\\n\\n\\tIt has been a cold snowy January!  It’s been snowing even more up in Minnesota, where my husband Chris and I have our home way up on the north shore of Lake Superior.  And it’s been really cold and the wind has been blowing hard which makes it colder.  Now Minnesotans know how to deal with snow, but the governor canceled school again last week because the snow was SO HIGH and the wind made the tempertures SO LOW.  Lots of church services and programs go cancelled too. So I was interested to read this blog from a Lutheran minister I know, David Lose, who was stuck at home; couldn’t get to church to hold meetings or study groups, or to the hospital or homes to visit people from his church. But his phone was still working and he spent much of the suddenly empty day calling various members of his congregation.  After helloes and a bit of casual conversation, he asked a number of different people the same question:  “What’s God been up to in your life lately?”  Now at first, most of his people simply went silent.  How would you answer that question this morning: “What’s God been up to in your life lately?”   The minister sat for a moment with what he called this “Holy Silence” on the other end of the line, and then said: “Well, what’s been keeping you awake at night?”  And one by one, the stories poured out.   This seemed to be an easier question!\\n\\tIt’s difficult, isn’t it, to talk about what God is up to in our lives.   Some people say, God is doing something in your life if you are blessed with being healthy or plenty of money or feeling happy or saved from some disaster.  But what about the times that are hard for us, when someone sick, not enough money, feel sad or someone in an accident.  Is God not blessing us?   Some people say God is punishing you if bad things happen.  I don’t think that is true.  When things happen in our lives, good or bad, is it humans that make them happen or is it God or is it both?  Hard questions!  \\n\\tLet’s look at Jesus’ teaching again:  he says some strange things:  Blessed are the poor, those who mourn, the meek (not powerful), the hungry.  What?  All these things that we think are NOT blessings, curses even.  But look what he says: these are all places where God’s action happens.   Where there is room to let God in;  When I realize everything isn’t perfect in my life, I realize that I don’t just do life on my own. Something happens in us and we start opening up to receiving.  Receiving from God, from others.  Receiving?  If we are followers of Jesus aren’t we supposed to always be giving?\\n\\tPassage from Micah – do justice, love kindness, walk humbly with God.  Those are about doing, giving, generosity.  \\n\\tTeachings of Jesus – yes, do/give/be generous.  AND learn to receive.  This is hard for us sometimes.  We want to be in control.  We want to be the givers.  But the blessed community has both givers and receivers.  We all need to take turns being one, then the other.  Not good for one group to always give, one group to always receive.  \\n\\tIn worship we get to practice being receivers.  Receivers of God’s word, God’s love and forgiveness.  Receivers of Communion, the symbol of Jesus’ ongoing presence among us and the community this offers.  In this church there is a tradtion of taking communion, tearing off the bread and then dipping it in the jucie.  Today, I invite you to practice being receivers by letting a server break the bread off for you.  Practice receiving it.  And then watch this week.  How are we the blessed community going out into the world.  Can we be both givers and receivers?  Amen.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\tOnce upon a time there were two young fish swimming along together in the ocean.  They passed an older fish who called out to them, “how’s the water, boys?”  The two young fish kept swimming and looked at each other.  “Huh?” said one of them.  And the other one replied, “what the heck is WATER?”\\nWater is all around us everyday, its all inside of us…it’s easy to become unaware of water.  To take it for granted.  That’s one reason we celebrate water from so many different places today, gathered together in this big baptismal bowl. \\n\\n\\tBut back when we were little tiny babies inside our mother’s, our first sensations were of the floating in the water of her womb.  We heard the watery whoosh of her heartbeat.  The gurgle of her tummy after she ate her dinner.  As we grow, our body continues to be mostly water.  Even our brains are 80% water and rests in a watery-cushion that protects it from getting jostled around too much inside our skull.   Our planet Earth is covered with a lot of water, so much so we should probably call it Planet Water instead of Planet Earth!  Astronauts have looked back at Earth from space and told us it looks like a blue marble hanging in the sky.  And scientists tell us that a long time ago, our ancestors actually lived and breathed in the water….Only recently, 375 million years ago, did they evolve and grow arms and legs and were able to crawl up on dry land.  \\n\\n\\tWhen Jesus walked around on Earth, about 2000 years ago, he showed up in a place that didn’t have a lot of water.  It is different than Minnesota; in the Middle East they don’t have 10,000 lakes like we do, and rivers and streams that flow big and wide through every season.  The land where Jesus lived is dry and deserty.  During his time, water was mostly found in springs that came up out of the ground, wells that people would dig….the water was mostly underground.  People would save it in cisterns and big stone jars.  But the tastiest, freshest water was water that was moving, flowing, which they all called “living water.”  Did you notice in the Bible passage that Jesus talks about “living water?”  “Out of the believers hearts will flow streams of living water.”  That sounds kind of strange.  What can this mean?\\n\\n\\tJesus said this about himself in the middle of a big festival at the Temple in Jerusalem.  It was a celebration of the fall harvest of fruits and vegetables, and people came from all around to go to the Temple and thank God.  They would remember how God provided for them, both food and water, when they fled slavery in Egypt and wandered for years in the desert before finally arriving at their new home in Israel.  Musicians, people singing, processions with flaming torches.  Very exciting.  The Temple priests, their ministers, would go to a special pool of water in the city and fill big gold pitchers with fresh water.  They would bring these back into the Temple and pour them into huge silver bowls, saying prayers thanking God for the water that brought the harvest, and asking that God’s spirit would pour down on them.  In the middle of all this worship hoopla and commotion, Jesus cries out:  “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in me drink!”  Huh?  What did he say?  Isn’t that the preacher guy from Nazareth?”  Jesus continued,  “and out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water!”  The work translated “heart” actually refers to a persons belly, their gut.  “Out of my followers gut, the seat of emotions in our Jewish culture,” Jesus is saying, “will flow rivers of living water!”  What on earth could this mean?\\n\\n\\tI’ve been reading a neat book recently written by a marine biologist named Wallace Nicols, and it is all about water.  He is famous for helping revive sea turtle populations down in Western Mexico.  But more recently he has been talking to brain scientists about how being around water affects how our brain works and how we feel.  He calls his book Blue Mind.   The author says that often we run around with our brain all fired-up with stress.  All these chemicals called hormones get released in us and we are ready to fight or run away.  Just like our ancestors long ago when faced with a mountain lion!  The author calls this our Red Mind.  When our brain acts that way it can help us get out of immediate danger.  But let’s face it, most of the time we’re not stressed about a mountain line.  We’re stressed about traffic or a church argument or our jobs or difficult homework or our pesky little brother.  The problem with being in Red Brain Mode is that it can get pretty exhausting and we often don’t make good decisions about what to do next.  \\n\\n\\t The author says we need a lot of time in Blue Brain mode, and water is just the thing to help us.  Jesus spoke of himself as “living water” – what is the connection here?  It seems that part of how our brains have developed over the years to solve big problems and be really creative has been because of our contact with water.   And that water may be the most important thing in nature that helps us stay connected to the natural world.   Water has long been a symbol in many world religions for a source of blessing, for the presence of the divine.  Jesus seemed to understand this intuitively, and he uses this festival ritual of pouring water on the altar as an opportunity to talk about God’s presence pouring into us…..and pouring out to others. \\n\\n\\tWater can sometimes be scary crashing wave knocks you over, pool water goes up your nose.  The waters of a flood or storm can be dangerous.  But brain scientists are reminding us that we need a number of things from water besides drinking it:  Why is the ocean so beautiful to look at on a sunny day?  We need to see the color blue of water because they have found looking at blue soothes us and inspires confidence.  Why do I sleep better if I hear a river rushing over rocks or the sounds of waves crashing on the shore?  We need to hear water as it moves rhythmically, because this moves us our brain into a relaxed state.  Watching fish swim in an aquarium or fish bowl,  watching sunlight dance on top of the water or along the bottom of a pool….Brain scientists say all of these experiences rest us, calm us, bring us an increase in our happiness and sense of well-being.   I don’t know about you, but I make much better decisions when I feel rested and calm.  If I’m paying attention, I also feel more open to God, not as tight and well defended as I struggle on my own to fix my life and those around me!\\n\\n\\tJesus said that “out of the believers heart will flow streams of living water.”   He said out of your heart, your gut, the center of your being, will flow positive emotions and sustained attention.   Maybe he meant if we lean into our partnership with him and his teachings, amazing things will flow into us and out of us.  Love, respect, peacefulness.  All the things our world needs more of.\\n\\n\\tBeing near water, touching water, being in water is something most of do everyday.  How might we be more intentional about these connections?  Indians from the Yakima Nation in Washington State live along the Columbia River, and have long known the power of water in their lives.  When they wake up they take a sip of water.  When they go to sleep at night that is that last thing they do: take another sip of water and say of prayer of thanks for this gift.   \\n\\n\\tI have started to do this simple practice, morning and night.  I take a sip of water and thank God for water.  I imagine God pouring the spirit of the living Jesus Christ into my own heart center, and I imagine that living water flowing out in love and compassion to others.  A small sip here.  A small sip there.  Maybe you would like to try that as a daily practice with spiritual intent.    What other simple water rituals might become part of something you do each day and affirm the presence of this “living water” of God’s spirit in your life?  Are there paintings or photographs on your walls at home of water, the ocean, lakes or rivers?   Bless yourself with water as you wash in the morning or before bed.  Turn on the tap and feel the rush over your hands.  Imagine God’s loving spirit pouring living waters into your heart, you pouring living waters of hope and love out to others.  \\n\\n\\tOut of our hearts, out of our very centers, shall flow rivers of living water!  May it be so.  Amen.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe over-the-topness of this account may actually be helpful in our figuring out how to make sense of the purported resurrection of Jesus.  For starters, we aren’t going to get “proof” that any of this happened, not in the way our predominant culture demands proof by amassing evidence.  This gospel, like the others, is silent about what actually happened inside the tomb during the night. Our brains come at this demanding an explanation, verification.  And it just isn’t there.  As we move deeper into this scene, what we get in this passage is testimony. What we have is the witness of those who experienced the Risen Jesus, and go on to tell us how this has transformed their lives.  That’s what’s going to unfold.  Two women who arrive grieving and dejected, grow increasingly frantic as they realize their beloved teacher’s body has disappeared….they are overwhelmed with fear….. and then strangely, begin to gather their courage, They dash off to spread the news that Jesus is risen, before they have really seen anything…..becoming curiously joyful.  And they runn smack damb into Jesus.  What’s going on here?  We aren’t going to get proof that God conquered death and resurrected Jesus, in the way 21st century folks like us want our facts verified.  We are going to get the testimony of these women, and eventually of the his other followers.  We are going to hear testimony to their changed lives.  And I think this sort of bugs us, because who wants to come to church all gussied up on Easter morning and be told they might need to change?  \\n\\tNotice what the angel is this account does NOT tell the two women:  “Hey, he’s back and all your problems are solved!”  No.  The angel starts to speak after the guards have gone mute; the men have freaked-out, shaken to their bones and have apparently fallen over in a swoon.  “Well! So much for the mighty power of imperial Rome,” muses the angel.  Turning to the women, the angel declares: “Do not YOU be afraid….like these numbskulls who have just fainted. “Roman guards symbolize the Powers.\\xa0 Jesus, leader of the powerless, killed by the powerful, comes to life, and the powerful collapse.”  Hmph!\\nPosted by\\xa0\\xa0on April 18, 2011 \\n“ I know why you are here,” continues the angel to the women.  “You’re looking for Jesus who was crucified.  He is not here.  He has been raised….as he SAID.  Come here, look inside where he lay.  Empty.  Now quickly go and tell the other disciples that he is raised from the dead.” Lest we think this resurrection news was just for the male disciples, remember that these guys have betrayed Jesus and all but disappeared from the scene. Mary Magdalene is featured in all four of the gospel accounts of this morning, which signals her conintuned vigilance through the crucifixion until this predawn scene.  It also reminds Matthew’s readers of the importance of Mary Magdalene to the early followers of the Way of Jesus.  Later church history will sully her reputation through the years, surmising that she must have been a prostitute before meeting Jesus.  Recent fiction writers titillate us with notions that she and Jesus were married.  But contemporary Biblical scholars now assert that whatever her personal transformation upon coming to know Jesus, she was one of his most important and most faithful disciples.  As the role of women in leadership dimenishes in the early church within a wider oppressive, patricarcal culture, her historical position becomes tainted and diminished.  Jesus’ mother is most likely the other Mary accompanying her this morning.  Mother Mary is then elevated on a pedestal of other-wordly purity and subservience, which women were to emulate.  We do well to remember that these women at the tomb actually are the first apostles, the ones who spread the Good News.\\n\\tNotice that the angel tells them Jesus is going ahead of them to Galilee.  They are all to meet him there.  The women instantly know what this means:  it’s where it all started.  It’s where they first met Jesus, as he publically preached and taught that the reign of God was present now, that God’s realm of justice and mercy for all was breaking in and transforming life as usual.  Galilee, where he showed what the reign of God looks like:  where he did his healing work, his radical inclusion of the most marginalized, his extravagant welcome of everyone.  I can hear the women gasp and then exclaim to each other:  this is what he was talking about!  Remember how in Galilee he told us that whenever we did something loving to the least of the people, those living in poverty, those scorned and rejected, the sojourner and the stranger, we would be doing it to him?   Yes, yes!  Now, WE are to be doing these things in his name!  \\n\\tThey turn away from the empty tomb, filled with a wild mixture of fear and joy, and run to tell the others.  They already get it.  They quickly turn a corner and WHAM, there’s Jesus, talking to them!  Our translation uses the salutation “greetings” but the original Greek seems to indicate something more ordinary like “hey there, wonderful to see you!”  Screeching to a halt, the women fall to the ground, and take hold of his feet.  What did they say to him?  Were they crying?  Were they laughing?  We don’t know.  They are overwhelmed with the clarity of it all, like a final puzzle piece slipping into place.   Jesus is still here with us; empowering us, sending us forth to seek and serve in his name.  Matthew simply concludes:  “Then Jesus said to them, “do not YOU be afraid, go and tell my brothers and sisters to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\\n\\tHere’s the thing about the resurrection.  It looks like a problem to our 21st century minds.  A big unbelieveable problem that we a told we have to wrap our rational brains around, or else!  It was the 20th century French philosopher and playwright Gabriel Marcel who made the distinction between a problem and a mystery.    He writes: “A problem is something I can stand outside and walk around. It’s something I can usually solve by technical skill. A broken window is a problem. I can solve it by fixing a new one….But a mystery I can’t solve. A mystery I can’t stand outside. I have to enter it. A mystery is something I can’t just look at. It absorbs me into it. Someone else’s answer is unlikely to work for me. I have to discover my own.”  Or as a more recent theologian and writer James Martin has noted, “the resurrection is not a problem to be solved by a mystery to be pondered.”\\n\\tAs I pondered this story, I began to wonder about the “Galilee” that I must go to in order to meet Jesus and minister along side of him.  Where is the place where we each will be able to minister to the least of these, in his name?  Where we will be the healers, the advocates, the visionaries for what has to happen next in the recreation and renewal of this precious world.  What streets must we rally in, what vulnerable groups do we need to track and advocate for now, what legislators must we visit, what part of our endangered environment do we need to take responsibility for, what new edicts and orders must we protest and resist? That’s our Galilee.   We start to understand Jesus being raised from the dead as we go enter the mystery of it.  We enter it by going to Galilee.  As individuals, and together as a congregation.   And this immersing ourselves in “Galilee” will change us.  As we say in our vision of what God calls us to be in this church:  we are seekers and servants growing in God’s transforming love.\\n\\tEaster poses the grown-up question:  “just how do I want to live the rest of my days?  Am I willing to go to the Galilee where I will asked to serve the Risen Jesus and those he champions?”  We will find the Risen Jesus there in many guises.  In seeking and serving, we will be changed.  Thanks be to God.  \\n\\tJesus the Christ is risen!  Alleluia!  Amen. \\n\\t\\n',\n",
       " '\\t Might there be spiritual guidance for us here, in the slow shift into November’s late autumn that often brings a somewhat solemn and reflective mood?  We might ask ourselves: am I sinking into melancholy or am I becoming more quietly alert?   All around us, the natural world seem to be stripping down; crispy leaves disappear into plastic bags and mulch piles, porch furniture moves into storage, gardens are all browns and greys.  I find myself watching and wondering as I walk over muddy ground and withered grass; there is an air of expectancy. The winter holidays careening around the corner?  No, that’s really not it.  God is astir among us, I sense.  Something, something is next.  Marv Hiles puts it this way:  “At no other season are we as aware that everything is more than it seems, the movement of the earth, our lives, and even the stories we tell…..Every motion taken individually or together is one expression of the Deep Source that informs this and all planets.”  \\nWhen I turned to our Gospel text from Mark for this morning, its somber and anticipatory mood offers guidance for this in-between time:  Mid-November, when we sit on the brink of seasonal festivities, right before the holiday chaos and delights that define the season for the much of our American society and our own faith community.   \\n“What an odd thing we do, here in the life of the church,” I find myself thinking each November.  Odd, because If we are really tracking God’s movement, we are bound to seem out-of-synch with the world at large. We live our day-today in the wider context of a post-Enlightenment, scientific world.  Yet in the Christian community we continually talk about things unseen and unmeasureable by normal standards.  Our day to day world is filled with the lure of material choices that focus on our personal preferences.  But in the church, we strive to put personal preferences aside as we follow the Spirit of the Risen Christ.  Within the gathered fellowship of the Body of Christ, we are reminded to look beyond appearances, to keep trusting God in new and different ways.  All this while our predominant culture is ratcheting up for the Christmas season, poised to consume Turkey feasts that serve commericially as the warmup for the shopping season ahead.  Yes, we do an odd thing here.\\nBoth our Gospel passage and this piece from the Letter to the Hebrews offer distinctive counterpoints to our everyday world of doing and producing, escalating schedules and multi-focusing; the world where we are valued by our ability to both build and consume.   Both texts allude to old worlds fading away, as a new reality ushered in by the life and ministry of Jesus is revealed.\\nLet’s turn to this strange conversation recorded between the disciples and Jesus here in Mark.  A bit of background: In his observations about the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, Jesus is alluding to common first century Jewish apocalyptic beliefs.  These assumptions included predictions about certain disasters preceeding the end of history as it is known and the start of God’s full reign on earth.  Apocalytic visions show up in Hebrew scriptures and later in the Christian New Testament, during the horrendous period of dislocation and persecution.  In vivid allegorical fashion, they describe upheavals and natural disasters which will accompany God’s rescuing of the whole world from evil and bringing final judgement and transformation.   Each of the four Gospels have Jesus referring to these prophecies at the end of his ministry, right before his arrest in Jerusalem.   \\nGospel author Mark was writing during a time of tremendous social upheaval in the later first century.  Populist uprisings sweeping through the region in revolt against Rome, and probably just as the temple in Jerusalem is defiled with Roman emperor Caligula’s statue.  In all this turmoil, Mark seeks to remind his struggling community of new and persecuted Christians, that God is still in charge of history.  He wants them, to stay fully awake and aware of God’s movements during difficult times. \\nAs we listen more closely to this interchange between Jesus and his followers, we notice they are standing outside the great Temple in Jerusalem. Jesus has been in constant debate with the Temple leaders about his interpretation of Jewish law and his radical inclusion of outcasts  in God’s Kingdom.   “Jesus, aren’t these temple walls and stones amazing!” we hear the disciples casually commenting.  “Incredible what people can do it they put their mind and backs to it!  Wow, awesome,” can’t you just hear them mutter among themselves.  Bless their hearts, they sound almost like the country bumpkins they really are.  Small town fishermen make it to the big city, gaping up at the skyscrapers!    \\nThey aren’t much different from us, actually.  Then, as well as now, we are often in awe of what humankind can construct:  be it medical nano-technology that sends tiny robots through our bodies, or face to face computer conversations the years our son was living in Taiwan, or predator drones that destroy distant enemies that our soldiers will never have to actually see.  Like the 1st century disciples, how easily it is to be enthralled by human ingenuity that seems so massive and so very permanent. But be it the Jersusalem Temple, the Berlin Wall or the World Trade Towers, it can all come tumbling down, for good or for evil.  We accept in theory that nothing lasts, Marv Hiles suggests, “but deny it in daily living as we cling to shining moments and safe places.”\\n\\tJesus keeps his focus not on the details or the when, but on the reality that all of that turmoil will be “but the beginning of the birth pangs.”  Something incredible, God’s hidden workings, are about to be manifest, says Jesus; they are going to be born among you.  But don’t despair over these difficult times, or be led astray by false teachers, he admonishes.  Hold fast, be alert and watchful, and stay focused on the work of proclaiming the good news.  Or as the German poet Rilke reminds us, stay focused on the One whose “hands infinitely calm, hold up all this falling.”  \\n\\tAnd this is where the Letter to Hebrews picks up the thread.  The job of the church is to proclaim the good news of this “infinitely calm holding” to the world. We are here to both “provoke and love” each other into doing this, as the text suggests. I love that: consider how to provoke, how to lovingly nudge, bug, cajole, one another to love and good deeds.  Go ahead and speak up about what matters to you around here.  Share your hopes for this church, with me and with one another. Pay attention to inklings and insights you have about where God is leading Emmaus in these times.   \\n\\tWe are to live with a confidence that, through Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrections, we are transformed into people who can actually interpret and do God’s will.  We have a “new and living way” to be together, as the Letter to Hebrews describes.  Yes, these times are difficult, and natural calamities and civil uncertainties and warfare continue to de-stablize and confound us.  We are still in the inbetween times, where good and evil struggle.  So much really does seem to be “falling” in our world and we wonder God is doing.  Don’t assume that God is just in the “shining moments and safe places.”  Watch for God’s healing and transformation of each of us and of our world, in spite of appearances to the contrary.  Be bold to name God’s activity as you encounter it.  Engage with it.  And known that “there is Someone, whose hands infinitely calm, holding up all this falling.”  (Rilke, “Autumn”)  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\tOne of the things pastors love most is when other people pray, not us.  Seriously, one of the most frustrating things is to have people assume that I am the only one in the room who can pray….out loud….appropriately.  Over these next five weeks of Lent, I’m inviting us to take an honest look at our prayer lives.  Not so much so we will start doing it “right” – whatever that might mean.   I don’t believe prayer is simply about asking a pony, or a new computer game, or even grownup things like a pay raise or a date, or even a miracle cure.  I’m not talking about praying more efficiently or accurately, so God will change God’s mind and grant our wishes more often.  I’m talking about prayer, words and silence, breath and movement that connect us most deeply with ourselves and with God who dwells within us.  Prayer that connects us with this present moment, with all its joy and hurt.  Prayer that enables us to maintain a sense of equilibrium, a certain flexible stance, while delights, success and surprises, and failure and suffering come into our lives.  Lent is a good time to bore down into our prayer lives, and see what is or what is not going on for each of us.\\n\\n\\tI’m suggesting a journey through the Lord’s Prayer as our way in this year.  Not because it is a magic formula that will get us what we want, but in large part because Jesus said something like:  “okay, you want to know about prayer?  You wonder what I am up to when I retreat from the crowds, and go away by myself for some quiet, to talk with God?  Here….start with this.”  Which I find helpful, because it isn’t about having a correct belief to start with, or even a really firm sense that God is there listening.  It’s sort of “do this and see what happens.”  \\n\\n\\tThe Lord’s Prayer.  You may have said this prayer a thousand times over your lifetime, or it may be entirely new to you.  Those who grow up in the church probably learn it as children, and it sure can seem pretty rote as we just rattle it off each Sunday.  You say it at a rapid clip and finish it in less than 20 sections…15 if you use the words “debt” instead of “tres-pass-es.” Jesus created this prayer at the request of his disciples, drawing on the beliefs, cosmology and mysticism of his first century Judaism.  It’s probably the best summary we have of his own values and unique perspective on the life well-lived.  During the next few weeks I will offer some different lens through which we might see this “inherited treasure” that has come down to us through the centuries (phrase from Neil Douglas-Klotz, Prayers of the Cosmos).  I urge us to soak in these words through each week, and to work and play with them in some different ways.\\n\\tIn Jesus’ time, it was not unusual for teachers, rabbis, healers to teach a certain prayer to their followers.  Jesus replied to his disciples’ request by saying: “When you pray, say:  Father, hallowed be Your name.”  This is probably closest to the original words of Jesus, although the version from Matthew’s gospel may sound more familiar to us.  (Take a look at the front of your bulletin, where we have included the references in three of the Gospels.  Gospel of John records long prayers of Jesus, but it doesn’t mention this one!)   The Matthew version, written in the later part of the first century well after Jesus died, is a bit expanded and was commonly used by the early churches in their worship life together.  “Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,” which is our focus this morning.\\t\\n\\n\\tIn ancient times, one’s name had a certain power: it proclaimed your selfhood.  Jesus starts by naming God:  our Father.  Immediately there is a communal piece to prayer with this word “our.”  Apparently, we don’t do praying, or following Jesus, alone.  We’re all connected in this act, to one another and to this Being.  And the name gives us a clue about who this Being is.  “Father” is a name for God rooted in the Jewish tradition, but Jesus adds something new we’ll consider in a moment.  I included this Exodus reading this morning, from the Hebrew scriptures, because these sacred Jewish writings are foundational to understanding the name and nature of God.  These are anchor texts for Jesus’ life and ministry.   This story of Jesus’ ancestor Moses and Moses’ encounter with God, is the back-story to how Jesus understood God.  Moses, born and raised in Egypt is now in hiding as a shepherd because he killed an Egyptian foreman who was brutalizing a Hebrew slave. In this interaction with a burning bush, this encounter with an angel and finally with God’s voice, Moses is told that God wants to free the Hebrew people from oppression in Egypt and take them to a new land.  Moses will lead them and God will go with him in this ominous task.  Unconvinced that this is a good idea, Moses finally asks, “look, I can tell them it is the God of their ancestors who has sent me, but they’re going to want to now your name.”  God replies, “tell them I AM has sent me to you.”   Literally, “I AM WHO I AM” – or even more accurately – “I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE.”  Whoever it is – whatever – God’s name and nature is not static.  By implication, there is going to be an evolving understanding in this relationship between God and God’s people, between God and all humanity, perhaps even an evolution in the very nature of God over time.       \\t\\n\\n\\tJesus’ understanding of God reflects this evolution of that comes down through the Jewish Law and the Prophets.  This is not a distant, capricious God, who punishes and rewards at whim.  This is a forgiving God of steadfast mercy.   And, Jesus is going to push this tradition, like any mystic sage who also happens to be a creative and prophetic reformer.  He will address God by an unusual name.  \\n\\n\\tBut what’s new here?  God had been called “Father” in Hebrew scriptures.  One of the problems in understanding Jesus’ original intent is that he and his followers spoke Aramaic, the native Middle Eastern language of ordinary people at the time.  After Jesus was killed and his followers experienced his resurrected presence among them, his sayings and stories about him continued to circulate in oral form in Aramaic.  These were eventually recorded in Greek, which is the language of the New Testament.  And as usual, some things have gotten lost in translation.  Aramaic scholar, Neil Douglas-Klotz in his book Prayers of the Cosmos, claims that we have lost considerable “heart consciousness and prophetic juice” of the original Aramaic tongue.  His work is controversial but compelling.  He points to other familiar teachings of Jesus such as “be you perfect” – frankly, words that tend to set my teeth on edge.  This scholar’s translation from the Aramaic suggests that Jesus was saying not “be perfect” but “be you all-embracing.” \\n\\n\\tDouglas-Klotz draws our attention to the name “Father” at the beginning of the prayer.  This name has become a bone of contention in many congregations: Father, in Aramaic, Abba.  This traditional, patriarchal language is a real problem for some of us and for others of us it is comforting and well loved title for God.  But think for a moment of how Jesus could have started this prayer: “Our high and mighty one” or “Our Judge,” or “Our warrior king,” titles also used in the Hebrew scriptures. But Jesus uses the word Abba to address God: in Aramaic, this word was a child’s word: it meant Daddy or Papa.  It suggests closeness, warmth, dependency.  I have learned an additional piece about this word abba from reading John Dominic Crossan’s book The Greatest Prayer: Rediscovering the Revolutionary Message of the Lord’s Prayer.  The author claims that in their male dominated society, the word “father” was often shorthand for “parents”, at that time, commonly father and mother.  So the word abba was not only intimate, relational language, but it also referred to what my kids used to call “the parental units.”   \\n\\n\\tThere’s one other new learning about this Aramaic word for “Father,” abba that I find fascinating.  The root of the word also means “rises and shines, vibrates, in space.”  I can feel my brain synapses crackle as I imagine this reality.  Jesus wanting us to know that this shining, vibratingness, the Oneness of God, was not something far away but includes every center of every activity and place we experience, and that has the potential for being.    Vibratingness.  I can’t help but think about the recent scientific discovery of gravitational waves emanating from the collision of two black holes, in a far corner of the universe, billions of years ago, finally washing over our earth and being recorded!  “Astronomy has grown ears” proclaimed one theoretical physicist.  (Lawrence M Krauss, New York Times, 2/14/16)   Could we be sensing, hearing, God’s vibratingness in a new way?  \\t\\n\\n\\t Of particular interest to me is that the Aramaic word for “heaven” actually means, “the universe.”   What looks like a geographical spot separate from us and our planet, “our Father who art in heaven,” is actually a place all around and within us.  Ponder this for a minute; put on this different lens about “heaven.”  Heaven is not a place separate from us, with angels strumming their harps and golden streets, and some kind of stern guy at the front gate with a book full of our personal sins.  Heaven is a place all around us and within us.  Filled with vibrating waves!  God is in all this, shining, rippling, washing over and through our very being.  This is sacred stuff moving through us, within us – holy, hallowed be God’s name!\\n\\n\\tPlay with this first part of the prayer this week.  Say it when you wake up in the morning.  Set it to some vibrating sound as you say it.  Sing it on one note: our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.  Try out the translation we will pray together in a few minutes, roll it around on your tongue: Ground of all being, Mother of life, Father of the universe,\\xa0Your name is sacred, beyond speaking.  Try just this first part as a breath prayer, while stopping at a traffic light: Our Father / who art in heaven/ hallowed be/ thy name.  In and out.  While washing dishes, shoveling snow, bathing the children, walking the dog, before checking your email.  This is Jesus’ gift to us…..let’s start to soak in it.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tThese are teachings from Jesus “Sermon on the Mount.”  The beatitudes of Jesus, as these writings are sometimes called.  Often intoned piously by preachers, leaving the rest of us rather befuddled. Some of us might find it  offensive to say that those who are poor, grieving, week and starving for justice and righteousness are blessed. We might notice that being a public peacemaker or pure in heart or being persecuted for your beliefs doesn’t gain you much status in the public square, either in our time or in Jesus’ era.  So, what is Jesus doing here?\\n\\n\\tSome historical context may help for starters.  Jesus begins his public ministry within an unsettled and precarious time for the Jewish people during the early first century.  They were living in occupied land, dominated by the repressive Roman regime.  The central religious question for Judaism at the time was: how do we, who seek to live just and merciful lives, relate to our enemies, to Empire, and we preserve our identity as people of faith?  This question has a distinctive contemporary ring for me this morning.  How do I, do we as Christians live just and merciful lives in this current polarized social and political climate?\\n\\n\\t In the first century, there were Jews who believed violent resistance was the only way to go.  Those known as Zealots, the guerilla warfare underground of the day,  had their answer: we take up the sword and overthrow the oppressors!  This will bring in the reign of God!  The Sadducess, the priests leading worship and sacrificial ritual in the Jerusalem Temple, sought to be more accomodating.  You want to put up a statue of Zeus in our sacred temple?  We don’t like it but we will go along to keep the peace, and we can keep worshipping in our tradition way.  The Pharisees, teachers of the Torah, the law, struggled with helping the people follow the Jewish law in this new context of occupation.   We resist with a certain righteousness through adhearnace to the law.  We create an ghettozed culture within Roman rule, and God will reward this with the coming of God’s reign on earth.  And the Essences, the radical contemplative types who removed themselves to separate monasteries like the Qumran community, basically said, we give up on all of this and seek to be righteous in exile.  \\n\\n\\tNow Jesus shows up and is addressing the same issue, but in a new way:  he starts talking about how people were to be an alternative community in the present in light of the future reign, empire of God….which was at hand!  Which was within them!  (Feasting on the Word commentary, Fourth Sunday in Epiphany, Year A). A paradoxical message that both confused and challenged people, especially as he talks about loving our enemies. \\n\\n\\tWhen I read the beatitudes, I always think of those British comedians, Monty Python, and their irreverent spoof on the story of Jesus called “The Life of Bryan.”  At one point in the movie, the camera focuses on Jesus  standing on a hill in the distance, speaking to a huge crowd.  “Blessed are the poor, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are the peacemakers,” Jesus declares.  The camera then pulls back and zooms in on several men in the crowd.  We overhear them wondering out loud:  \\n\\tWhat did he say?\\u2028I think it was “Blessed are the cheesemakers.”\\u2028Aha…, \\twhat’s so special about the cheesemakers? \\u2028Well, obviously it’s not meant \\tto be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturer of dairy products.\\n\\tWe hear these words 2000 years later, and we’re still trying to figure out what Jesus meant.  What is this about “blessings?”  In our world, we tend to associate God’s blessings with worldly goods and financial gain, with unexpected rescues from danger or reprieves from catastrophe.  This is the message of the Prosperity Gospel which has gotten increasingly popular of late.  And there is a thread of this thinking laced through the Bible. Law abiding and righteousness would be rewarded by God, with wealth and well-being.  It’s part of our Protestant work ethic: if you work hard, you will be rewarded with riches.  This assumption continues today in popular thinking.  When we see others faced with poverty, with want, with difficulties or disasters, we assume it is their fault.  We tend to ignore the restrictions of systemic racism and classism, and figure people are just lazy if they are unemployed or unsuccessful.  If difficulties happen to us, we may start wondering if God has abandoned, or even “unblessed” or “cursed” us.   “Well, I must have done something to deserve this mess,” I have heard not a few people say to me in times of trial.\\tBut the teachings from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount seem to challenge this view of blessings of health and abundance as reward.  Let’s listen it again:  “Blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek, blessed are those who are reviled and persecuted, blessed are those who hunger and thirst…” How odd this sounds to us.\\n\\tPart of the problem here is that it is hard for us to describe just what God is up to in our lives.  I know of a pastor who tried asking members his congregation to describe this.  He reports they stared back blankly.  He tried a different question: “well, what’s been keeping you awake at night?”  And one by one, the stories poured out.   It’s difficult, isn’t it, to talk about what God is up to in our lives.  We don’t want to sound overly pious, or even presumptuous.  Many of us feel uncomfortable around people who talk like God is in their back pocket, or like a personal valet:  “God found me this perfect parking spot!”  or  “Of all the abandoned cars in the snowstorm God pulled us through.”   But most of us are can describe what keeps us up at night.  All those “unblessings!”\\n\\n\\tJesus constantly talked about what God was up to in his life, as well as in the lives of just about everyone he met.  In today’s passage, he says all kinds of people are blessed who seemed particularly “unblessed” in their culture.  Poor people, disempowered people, the grieving, the people working for peace, the persecuted.  Funny how similar this list is in our day; none of these states of being are admired much in our world that values wealth, status and power. In fact, as a nation we seem to be having a real problem at the moment with all kinds of people who don’t seem very “blessed.”  With the imposing of new immigration restrictions, I am wondering about “The tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free, wretched refuse, the homeless, the tempest tossed” who seek to come to our shores.  Recognize these words from our Statue of Liberty?  I can’t help but hear these beatitudes, “these blessed are” statements this morning without thinking about this unbelievable possibility that our elected officials are attempting to limit entry of immigrants from seven predominately Muslim countries.  Even with a Federal Judge in New York issuing a stay against this presidential order and thousands of people swarming in protest at JFK airport last night….something very un-American seems to be going on here.   The writings on the pedestal of our Statue of Liberty in New York harbor suggests we are better than this.\\n\\nHere’s Jesus approach to relating to our enemies: He lists the kinds of people who were being drawn to him, who know their emptiness and their need for God, who could taste their search for meaning, who longed for healing and hope.  Over and over in the Biblical tradition, the care for people in these situations was a sign of God’s realm breaking in.  I am proclaiming “Good news to the poor, release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind,” Jesus quoted from the ancient Jewish prophet Isaiah in his first sermon in his hometown synagogue. \\n\\n\\tSo, what is “blessed” about being poor, weak, grieving or yearning for righteousness?  First of all, being in these conditions, or worrying about them,  are the kinds of things that keep a lot of us up at night.  How can these things that keep us awake, that tug at our attention, stirring us up, worrying us, be the places where we are blessed?  As weird as this sounds, I am beginning to think that there is some truth here.  Because if I am honest, I have to admit that I seldom have trouble sleeping when I am feeling happy and peaceful about things; and I also seem to pray less and connect with the Spirit of the Risen Jesus less during these contented times.  Things that keep me awake at night are often connected to worries of impending loss or lack of abundance, of being mis-understood or even rejected.  These thoughts are often woven with feelings of weakness and powerlessness that drive me nuts.  This is the stuff that makes us want to protect ourselves, to push people away, to place bans.  But could these challenges be places where we are actually blessed?  Where we are thrown back on our dependence on God?  Could these be the worrisome conditions that actually help us grow, help us develop empathy with those who are struggling even more mightily than we are? \\n\\tA few challenges for us this week.  Perhaps write a letter or make phone calls to or visit with your elected officials; let them know what you think of about an immigration ban that appears to targetson specific religion.  Brainstorm with me about ways we can, as a congregation, deepen our connections with our Muslim neighbors.  Notice a place in your life that seem “unblessed.”  Might this be a place where God is working in your life, in that difficulty? Where is God nudging us, challenging our assumptions and fears, softening and opening our hearts, pushing us forward? How are we each blessed?  How will we be a blessing to others?  Let’s explore together.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\n\\tBut, we know how it can be if you wander into someone else’s family reunion, where you don’t know the stories and traditions:  Even if the welcome is warm and the food is delicious, one can feel mystified and maybe even left out of the festivities!  How does a group share its stories and traditions in a way that welcomes and includes the ever-present newcomers in your midst?  Even more daunting, how does a congregation celebrate the blessings of the past, while acknowledging some of the problems, the disappointments, even the mistakes?  As we look backwards, how do we not de-rail the on-going need to discern and move into God’s future together?  This can be especially challenging in an interim period between called pastors, when the congregation is feeling a bit unsettled, disoriented, hurt, frustrated, or just plain tired.  And when the future looks uncertain.  \\n\\n\\tAs I described in my first sermon as your Interim Pastor last week, we have important conversations and exploration ahead of us.  We need to establish better mutual accountability about what is said and done around here: Pastor, lay leaders, and church members.  Having been with you just two weeks, I can already sense your yearning to reach across established divides, your curiosity and interest in learning more about each other’s values, beliefs, faith experiences, hopes for this church.  I sense your deep desire to dream together anew.  Looking backwards, looking backwards: both important for any congregation in transition.  Might there be wider context for our celebrating that can guide us in this complex and tender spiritual exploration together?\\n\\tFor starters, it intrigues me that the beginning of this 75th year anniversary of Falcon Heights Church, UCC, falls on World Communion Sunday.  Celebrated by Christians around the world each first Sunday in October, World Communion Sunday is also in its 75th year!  The common enemy of rising fascism was the motivation for the creation of World Communion Sunday in 1939.  The dream?  If Christians around the world could gather around the Table of Our Lord and remember their essential unity - all partaking of the common loaf and the common cup, seeking to be Jesus’ disciples together - maybe that unity would be enough to fight the evils of Nazism and pull the world out of the nightmare of war.  That unity theme again:  ”same mind and same heart” that Paul talked about in our Philippians reading from last week….for the purpose of doing God’s work in the world together.  \\n\\nThe context broadens as we consider the assigned passages from the Revised Common Lectionary for this Sunday.  Our Hebrew Scripture happens to include the Decalogue, or more commonly known to us as “the 10 Commandments.”  As we just listened to four generations read these words, I thought about your founders’ dreams of passing these unifying precepts on to future generations of Falcon Heights members.  But if we think of these commandments simply as injunctions intended to make morally faithful and upstanding citizens of out of our young people, we are misguided.   As the ancient Israelites received these commandments, they were early in their relationship with God and one another as a people. Having escaped slavery under the repressive Egyptian empire around 1400 BCE, they were now faced with all the complexities of living as a newly freed community. Traveling through the barren wilderness together to their new home, they have been quarreling with their leader Moses, and demanding water and food.  God has provided for their needs, but Moses is getting pretty frustrated with all of them.  Clearly some more direction is needed.  \\n\\nOne way to look at these 10 laws is to think of how God is reframing life for them.  “I am the Lord your God….I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.  Here are the basics: there are lots of things you can worship out there, but you all and I have a special connection, a covenant.  I am in charge, but not as some despotic human ruler.  You will be my treasured possession….a holy nation….so here are the basics.”\\n\\n\\tThe 10 Commandments are not quick and easy answers to all of our 21st century ethical choices. We face ethical debates today they could never have imagined.  But the commandments do what a strong church should do:  they re-frame life for us.  They remind us Christians that something is expected of us! This is pretty counter-cultural these days.  We live in a predominant society that focuses on what we can expect from others, what is our due, what we are owed.  We may even come to expect that church will be the place where our personal preferences are met, from church décor to outreach priorities.  But, maybe church should be the place where our preferences can be lovingly challenged, so we can more fully take on the heart and mind of Christ in our lives.  The living God of our Biblical tradition expects things of us, the Israelites were learning; this is part of radical commitment to God and God’s purposes.  \\n\\nWhat God expected for the Israelites was that they create and nurture a community that was radically different than what they knew in Egypt.   No longer was the goal of community to be wealth and privilege based on what you can produce.  If God’s dream for the world was a place where people thrived in mutually loving relationships and communities marked by justice and peace, then the Israelites were to be the stuff of God’s dreams: a community known for its unified commitment to God, with compassion for its neighbors, with inclusion and mercy for the marginalized.  For us in our world that continues to value wealth and privilege, we also are called to create an alternative community.  Where differences are resolved with respect and trust. The deal is, this kind of community takes constant vigilance, because we will continually get drawn back into the values of the world.  We will prize buildings above mission, and winning arguments over the needs of the whole.   We may even hope to re-create past programs that do not fit the spiritual needs and societal challenges of the world around us.\\n\\n\\tThe tendency of church anniversaries is to primarily glorify past successes.  The lure of past successes is strong, whether we are an individual or a congregation, and the apostle Paul knew this.  He speaks in this letter to the conflicted church at Philippi of the acquired honor he has received from adhering to his religious tradition.  Be careful here that we don’t assume this means Christianity is better than, or supersedes, Judaism.  Think of Paul as a reformer of his inherited tradition, not unlike Jesus himself.   And hear these tough words about acquired honor from a splendid past:  “Whatever gain I had, I count it as loss for the sake of Christ.”  As the Biblical commentary website from local Luther Seminary describes it this week:  Paul states that he regards all attributes of ascribed and acquired honor as “loss” and even “rubbish” (the Greek term\\xa0“skybalon”\\xa0can also mean “dung”).  Ouch!  A rather indelicate way to put past successes in a different light!  One commentator (Christian Eberhart, professor of religious studies at University of Houstin) continues:  In the framework of the ancient Mediterranean world, the apostle was countercultural. He no longer strives for such “gain;” now his only gain could be Christ (Philippians 3:8).  \\n\\n\\tI say this not to put a damper on our celebrating of the past at Falcon Heights Church.  But Paul is challenging us to look carefully at what gives us a sense of honor in life and here in this church.  Ultimately, it is neither the successes nor the failures that define you as a church and or all of us as individuals.  What defines us is the transformative “power of Christ” working inside of us.  It is the power of the resurrection that helps us each experience our own resurrections, our own transformations….so we can become Christ-like in a world that desperately needs us.  So we can continue to dream, to intuit and perceive, God’s dream for this planet.\\n\\n\\tThis is what we will need to track in the coming interim time together:  God’s dream now for this congregation.  Where, in all these past successes as a congregation, do we see the power of Christ?  Where do we see the power of one who calls us to a counter-cultural stance in a materialist world that is interested in numbers and big budgets and fancy buildings?  The power of one who calls us to welcome those on the margins of our world.  To be a family church that widely reinterprets what it means to be family.  Here is the original dream of this church….not just a lovely building but a space in which powerful things will happen: God is glorified and through which humankind is engaged and served.  Thanks be to God, who sets us to dreaming, again and again.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\tIt takes a certain degree of vulnerability and courage to talk about our personal beliefs.  If we are really sharing from the heart about our own experience, our wonderings and our doubts, it can crack us open.  Will I be judged negatively for what I say?  Will people think I am strange, possibly addled or just horribly wrong?  Will it become an intellectual debate about ideas and I’ll just feel out-of-my-league?   Exploring our beliefs together, as we are doing each Sunday during the month of August, is a risky process.  But the feedback I am getting is from those of you who joined me for feedback and discussion these last two Sundays after worship experienced this as a tender, even intimate, process.  Twenty of you stayed after worship last Sunday to talk about Jesus, leaning in around the round coffee table, in the midst of the hubbub of Coffee Hour.  You listened carefully and compassionately to one another, sharing stories ranging from personal encounters with the Holy, to doubts and affirmations, all the while grappling with this audacious Christian claim that this Jesus we seek to follow is somehow both human and divine.   Too big a group, and too little time, to really get down into it with everyone.  But I sense we departed after an intense 30 minutes with a hunger for more such sharing and exploration among us.\\n\\n\\tToday, we come to the portion of the United Church of Christ Statement of Faith that speaks of God’s actions through the Holy Spirit.  You have probably noticed by now that the whole Statement is framed in this manner: describing the actions or deeds of God among us.  Your forefathers/mothers here at Falcon Heights Church chose this denominational testimony as the “basis of our common purpose, faith and covenant,” as described in Article II of your church constitution.  I suggest it is up to each succeeding generation in the church to fully examine this heritage and claim it as your own, or figure out some different “basis for our common purpose, faith and covenant.”  This is not about devising a test of faith that you apply to everyone.  It’s about better understanding and  communicating to a spiritually hungry community what you stand for here.\\n\\n\\tAnthony Robinson is the UCC pastor and author I have been quoting extensively through this series, as he is an able guide in helping us clarify the central theological purpose, the why, the juice that fuels do what we do here.  I’ve been referring to his accessible book What’s Theology Got to Do with It: Convictions, Vitality and the Church because I think he addresses a critical question for anyone who cares about the future of the church.  How do we each move from being a spectator to being a participant, not just in church activities, but also in the experience of God working in our lives?  Robinson contends that our vagueness about the Holy Spirit is part of the problem.  Or, as one of his friends commented to him, “growing up it seemed it was the Father, Son and the Other One.”  Holy Spirit sort of as an afterthought, or something that those noisy Pentecostal churches did, with all their hand waving and moaning and dancing in the aisles.  What’s interesting, notes Robinson, is that “Pentecostal forms of Christianity, which emphasize the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, are today sweeping through much of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in in Latin America and Africa” (p.135).  What do we make of us this?  Easy to assume that these third-world people are simply lacking in education and sophistication, and that in their often-impoverished communities the Pentecostal Church helps them passively accept their sorry plight.   Not so fast, cautions Robinson and I would agree.\\n\\n\\tLet’s pause here and read this part of the UCC Statement of Faith together, as printed on the front of our service bulletin.  I invite you to join in, even if you feel you cannot intellectually consent to each and every word.  Try it out; see how it sounds and feels on your tongue, and as you listen to the voices around you.  Let us read together:\\nYou bestow upon us your Holy Spirit,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0creating and renewing the church of Jesus Christ,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0binding in covenant faithful people of all ages, tongues, and races.\\n\\tNotice the verbs, which attribute certain actions to God:  You bestow, create, renew, bind.   In the deed, the action, of bestowing on us God’s Holy Spirit, God creates and renews the church of Jesus Christ, and binds together all kinds of faithful people.  How are we to understand this?  What’s new here that isn’t in those first two sections about God and Jesus?  Why should this piece matter?  And where on earth did all this language come from in the first place?\\n\\tThis is where it helps to turn to the writings that inform our Christian tradition, particularly those of ancient scripture we call the Bible.  Exploring our beliefs is not just about us and our own brains and our own private spiritual experiences.  You and I step into a vast river of experiences, musings and declarations of other people who have gone before us.  The scripture passages for today give us a taste of how others have experienced the Holy Spirit.  They also speak to how it is that the Holy Spirit manages to reform and transform institutions (like churches) and individuals.  How is it that the Holy Spirit moves us from being “spectators to participants in the Christian life?” (Robinson, p. 135).\\n\\tWe heard this Pentecost story in the weeks following Easter, as it marks the end of a period of 40 days when the Risen Jesus appeared to his followers and then, in the mysterious language of the Gospel stories, ascended into heaven.   We’re not quite sure what was going on for his followers up to this point, as the men and women who kept encountering his unexpected and unusual presence sorted through what this all meant.  Dead but alive?  Gone but here?  What does this tell us about what’s next for us, they must have wondered. They have come Jerusalem for this major pilgrimage feast of Pentecost, which Jews celebrated to commemorate God’s gift of the Law to Moses on Mt. Sinai. Jesus has promised just before he ascends, according to the first chapter in Acts, that his followers will “receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”   Still crippled with grief and confused about what to do next with their lives, what would this mean to them?  \\n\\tAs the account goes, a number of them are assembled together, and experience a rush and roar like the wind and tongues of flame upon their heads like fire, and they all start talking in different languages, attesting to the deeds of God.   People overhearing them, from all parts of the middle east, are able to understand what they are saying about God, and God’s desire to reach out among humans with compassion and justice.   The “now what” for Jesus’ followers is getting answered:  they are to somehow take on Jesus’ power and his work.  It is their job now to go out and work with God’s transforming power that empowers people to be healed and heals the world.  “Oh, I get it now,” they may well have said to each other:  this is what Jesus was talking about that last night we had supper together; you remember, right before Judas betrayed him and we went to that garden to pray and he got arrested.  Remember?  He spoke of the Advocate, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit coming to us.  He said it will teach us everything, and remind us of all he has said to us.  It’s here, it’s on us, in us, around us.  How might we let it transform us?”  \\n\\tIt’s not just about Jesus’ followers 2000 years ago in Jerusalem.  The Holy Spirit is here, it’s on us, in us, around us.  How might we let it transform us?  This is the work of ongoing spiritual practices that we would do well to further explore together in this interim period.  What work does the Holy Spirit need to do within each of us?  Within the way you are together as a congregation?  Come, let’s talk about the work of God through the Holy Spirit.  Join me as we start the discussion, in the Gathering Room after worship today.  Amen.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe scripture passage we just heard from the Gospel of Mark is both dramatic and gruesome.  Who could blame anyone for wondering, “now why do I need to go to church to hear this kind of off-putting tale of a first century beheading? Aren’t we here to be inspired, to find comfort and encouragement?”   But our Common Lectionary passage, read today by Protestants and Catholics all over the world, brings us to this account that Mark has sandwiched into the beginnings of Jesus ministry. The horrific death of John-the-Baptist in the middle of his description of Jesus sending out his disciples to preach, teach and heal and their reassembling for the miracle of the feeding of the feeding of the 5000. Why does Mark interrupt his narrative, and linger over Jesus’ cousin’s sudden, violent demise?  \\n\\t\\n\\tIf Jesus had mentors, and I am sure he did, John was certainly one of them.  We don’t have details on how much time they spent together, these two cousins, but Jesus is baptized by him.  John, this strange, brazen man, preaching repentance and baptizing people, including Jesus, in the wilderness.  But by this point in Jesus ministry, John has been arrested by King Herod Antipas, a cruel and pompous Jewish leader who had become Rome’s puppet ruler of the region.  Apparently, Herod was intrigued by the Baptizer and his message.  But he was also humiliated by the prophet’s broadcasting the truth of Herod’s improper marriage, through adultery, to his brother’s wife.  “Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand,” had been John’s incessant message. This was not just a call to individual confession and conversion.  By the first century, “repent” had become almost a code word for a pointed Biblical critique of the abuse of power (Rick Marshall, 7.12.09, Process Theology site).  John’s call to people to repent, for the Kingdom of God was at hand, resonated with the prophetic tradition of Israel.  The prophets were out-spoken truth-tellers who would confront their own leaders about their incessant oppression of the poor and marginalized, their war making, and their unjust deeds.  So, the very word “repent” meant to challenge, to destabilize business as usual, and to radically question the status quo.  And it could get you imprisoned and possibly killed.\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tMarks’ point in telling us about this? The story clearly foreshadows what Mark and his community of readers would already know:  Jesus also will be killed by secular authorities for his truth-telling.  Like Herod, Pontius Pilot who will examine Jesus, will seem perplexed by this prophetic one before him.  Herod reportedly admired John, viewing him as a holy and righteous man.  Pilot will later insist on Jesus’ innocence.  Both men will let inflamed by-standers decide the prisoners’ fate.  Ironically, John’s disciples will ask for his body and give him a proper burial.  Jesus’ disciples, except for a few scrappy women followers, will run away and hide.   We might hear the writer Mark ask his readers down through the ages. “What are YOU going to do as Jesus disciple?” By the time Mark is writing, probably during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero in the mid 60’s AD, it is becoming clear that being a follower of Jesus can be dangerous.\\n\\t\\n\\tBut it doesn’t really seem very dangerous to follow Jesus today, at least not in this country, not in Dorchester County.  Which makes me wonder a bit: are we missing something here?  As I prepared our “Caring for Creation” children’s program this week on water, I was reminded that water in the Bible often symbolizes the outpouring of God’s spirit and blessing.  This is understandable in a desert culture like the Middle East.  What I had not realized was that in Biblical times, water was considered a free gift from God.  If you had to pay for water, this was a mark of oppression and unjust treatment.  I learned that our United Church of Christ has joined with faith communities worldwide to help address the needs for clean water and sanitation.  Of course I have had a vague sense of diminished water resources around the planet, heard the stories of people wanting to buy and ship lakes in Canada.  But to actually absorb the facts that 2.5 billion people lack clean water and basic sanitation was sobering.  Over 2 million people die each year of waterborne illnesses, many many of them children.  And there is apparently plenty of fresh water on the planet; it is just no longer clean, nor often accessible.  Internationally, more and more people are beginning to talk about access to clean water as being a human right.  More and more corporations are buying up water supplies.  As water becomes a private commodity you have to buy to use, once again, those without the money are left out.  \\n\\t\\n\\tCan speaking up about this need get you in trouble?  You bet it can. The international relief organization Church World Service website descripted how a pastor in the Philippines was murdered because of the advocacy work he was doing around water.  To push those in power to provide clean water for those in need – in some places, this can get you in deep trouble.   \\n\\t\\n\\tAs I read through Mark’s story of John the Baptist and King Herod, I was reminded of a recent comment by the Lutheran pastor who leads a new church out in Denver.  (Blog on-line “Theoblog” of the Christian Century Magazine,) The Rev. Nadia Bolz-Weber’s congregation is filled with mostly urban professional young people, not the kind of people regularly seen in most main-line pews on a Sunday morning.  The church is filled with sort of a nerdy and tattooed 20-30’s crowd; they call “House for All Sinners and Saints.”  Pastor Nadia described being asked recently by a friend if she thought this obviously successful new church would grow into a large congregation: “I smiled broadly (in reply to this question) looking up at the sky and then back at my friend. \"Um,\" I said, \"well...no.\" My friend looked at me, shocked at my seemingly low self-esteem. \"There\\'s just not a huge market for the message \\'Jesus bids you come and die\\',\" Pastor Nadia explained. \"People don\\'t exactly line up around the block for that.”  (end quote)\\n\\t\\n\\tSpeaking up for God is certainly not for the faint of heart.  “The truth will set you free,” taught Jesus.  It can also get you into trouble. The Gospel writer Mark might ask us as individuals, as a church:  are you getting in trouble enough?  \\n\\t\\n\\tThe problem for Herod is the trouble and shame of loosing face.  He admires John the Baptist, thinks he is a holy man.  But he ends up making a promise, in front of his family and guests: He vows to give his wife’s daughter whatever she wants.  And after consulting her scheming mother, who has been denounced by John, the girl boldly demands:  the head of John the Baptist on a platter.   Herod ultimately makes the self-protective choice.  Is this different from most of us?  Faced with losing a sense of control, or our public image or a feeling of influence, do we make choices that seem to protect us….but ultimately chip away at our integrity, and even the well-being of others?\\n\\t\\n\\tSome time this week, we may be faced with a choice between protecting our self, our self-esteem, our prestige our place….and choosing something else that might lead to transformation, of ourselves, of others, of the world.  I pray to God that we each recognize those moments when they happen.  We probably will not have to risk our lives this week so someone will have access to clean water.   But something will challenge us, a choice not unlike Herod’s coming up out of the blue.  It may challenge our assumptions, customs, traditions, even laws.  Will we choose expediency and saving face?\\n\\t\\n\\tJesus sent his disciples out to cast off unclean spirits that held people in the clutches of inner deception.  He told them to heal people, challenging the lie that God punishes people through illness.   “Tell them the truth will make them free; the truth about God’s love and forgiveness and hope.”  Jesus told them to speak the truth to power, to proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand and all should repent.  Jesus disciples were to share in both his authority and his mission, as do we today.  That is our call as followers of Jesus.  We gather as the church so we can explore it together.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.     ',\n",
       " '\\tHearing this story, I wondered: how might a “worship card” might function?  This young boy may be on to something important about communal life together as a church, and perhaps this will help us understand our sacrament of baptism a bit better.  Any “plastic” has to have something loaded on it, cash in the bank or available credit, for it to be worth anything.   I suggest that a “loaded” worship card can do more than we know.  It provides certain value:  spiritual, intellectual and emotional currency, that, for starters, enables us to make life choices based on our values and beliefs.   But just what is it that gets loaded up on our internal “worship card” when we participate in Sunday mornings together?   Shifting the analogy a bit, is worship simply a spiritual Holiday station where we dip in for a quart of intellectual stimulation and a loaf of “feel good” inspiration?  Are we just privately “tanking up” when we come here?   Not according to one of the 6 year olds in my northern Virginia congregation!\\n\\tEach month in our newsletter, I describe our weekly worship as “the heart of our life together” here at First Congregational UCC.  In worship, we learn more about God and we learn more about the needs of the world, so we can go out and help heal God’s creation.   But I also think that one of the most important things that gets loaded up on our “worship card” is a deeper understanding about ourselves.  And this changed perspective about ourselves eventually starts to make a real difference in our lives.\\n\\tOur Biblical forebearers spent a lot of time asking God to clarify their current situation:  “are you still with us? they would demand of God during difficult times.  Who are we to you, chopped liver?”  In their worship and in their sacred writings, the community would recount where they had been and what it had meant:  Released from slavery in Egypt, given a new land so they could become a light of justice and compassion to all nations.  As followers of Jesus, we stand within this tradition of those who would look back and remind themselves of God’s claim on them.  Now the Bible is full of stories of people not living up to God’s intentions, yet they keep claiming whose they are.  As part of this family line, we are invited to see ourselves in today’s words from the prophet Isaiah:  we have been taken by and kept by God, we too have been given a covenant to be that Light and to open the eyes of the blind, release the prisioners.  Why?  Because God is always doing a new thing, and we are to be part of it because of who we are as God’s children.  \\t\\n\\tWhy does this matter?  Because the world so often tells us otherwise.  Our media tells us we are important if we look a certain way, are a certain age and own certain things.  Bosses tell us we matter based on our productivity.  Who are we; whose are we?  Are we owned by our work, our hobbies, our volunteering, or by our debts, our past failures or mistakes?  We come to worship and we hear a different message:  we are reminded that we are created, formed, redeemed, owned by God.  According to the prophet Isaiah, writing during the horrendous time of Israel’s capture and exile, we are each called by name:  “you are mine,” says God.   Whose are you, Anne?  Who names and claims you?  Well, I come from the Swallow clan, hardy New England stock, married into the Gillis clan, lived in a lot of places, sure do like to think that I own myself, have autonomy over myself, if I’m really honest.  Empowered and independent, I am! Don’t nobody own me! \\t\\n\\tBut scripture seems to indicate otherwise:  “Anne, you are not your own.  Your are mine, says God.”  We each are God’s off-spring, God’s children, sons, daughters of the living God.  When we celebrate the sacrament of Communion each month, we are enacting this sign of God with us in community, the Spirit of the Living Christ in our midst at the Table.  When we baptize our little babies and our adults in the sacrament of baptism, we affirm that they are God’s children, and we promise to be as family to them in their faith formation.   When you and I worship together, Sunday after Sunday, we are loading up this identity awareness on our “worship card.”\\nI have sometimes wondered what Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan.  John the Baptist invited fellow Jews to publically step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized in recognition of the forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly drew Jesus to do this outdoor ritual, to emerge from an obscure young adulthood, and align himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  Did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually dry himself?   Desiring to turn his life around, was he seeking to quench some deeper thirst in those river waters.  Did he hope to ritually engage his past and his future as he entered into a dramatically public and dangerous path of teaching and healing?  Did memory of his baptism bring him comfort and courage as he faced rejection and eventual persecution, torture and death?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  At the River Jordan, did Jesus come to recognize himself as worthy, loved and intimately connected to God.  Matthew says he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”  Perhaps the question for each of us is similar:  Do we know ourselves to belong to God, to be beloved sons and daughters?  Do we truly experience that God is pleased with us?\\n\\tEach week when we come to worship we come as a slightly different person.  We may bring a new awareness of our gratefulness, a deeper sense of our need to forgive someone, some increasing anxiety or fear, a growing sense that we need to be accountable for an area of neglect or wrongdoing in our lives.  It’s hard to admit this stuff; we don’t want to seem weak or dependent.  But ultimately, what guides our lives?  The world? Or God?  The rigors of Christian life, with the constant call to self-honesty, generosity, openness and inclusivity, can be overwhelming.   We worship together and load up our “worship card” as we remember whose we are.  We boldly say we are identified individually, named, by the Mysterious Creator of the Universe, and that this reality lays claim on us.  Slowly, over weeks and months, our consciousness is transformed, our souls are awakened.   We load up our worship card with this empowered awareness.  And then we once again head out into the world, to live and serve in Jesus’ name. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'After discovering the empty tomb, the disciples of Jesus basically went back into hiding.  Last Sunday, we heard how Mary Magdalene unexpectedly stumbled upon the Risen Jesus in a garden outside the tomb, mistaking him for a gardener.  When she finally recognized the stranger as her beloved Teacher and Lord, the interaction between the two was painfully brief.  She was left to try and explain all of this to the understandably skeptical disciples.   \\nAt this point in the John’s narrative, it is the “evening on that day.”  The rest of Jesus’ disciples are now worried that the religious authorities will come after them too, as they have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.   John’s Gospel notes they are hiding “for fear of the Jews.”  Important to note this It is more an anachronistic reflection.  Alleged hostility towards the Jews of Jesus time is a reflection of the later first century tension between John’s Hellenistic gentile Christian community and the local synagogues.  We hear echoes of this tension in the reading from Acts, where several of the disciples are being tried by the Jewish court in Jerusalem for their continued proselytizing in Jesus’ name. Negative generalizations about subsequent Jewish communities will become the regrettable origin of the ancient and deadly lie about “Christ-killers.”  This will lead to the eventual persecution of Jews by Christians down through the centuries. \\nThat long-ago evening, after the discovery of the empty tomb, the men and women disciples sat together behind locked doors.   They shared food they probably could not taste and conversation that heightened their despair.  Suddenly, a stranger appears before them.  “Peace be with you,” says the stranger in greeting, a conventional greeting perhaps meant to remind them of Jesus’ promised gift of peace at the Last Supper.  But no, they still don’t have a clue as to who this is.  Is Mary Magdalene with them?  This would be her second ecounter with the Risen Jesus.  But the roomful remains astonished and confused.  What ever we make of these stories, what is curious is that Jesus followers do not recognize this stranger as Jesus until he shows them the wounds in his hands and side.  They are in hiding, feeling anxious, victimized, wounded by grief, themselves.  But then they see Jesus’ wounds.   Their perspective changes, which leads into the “now what?”\\nThis is significant change of perspective, says Rowan Williams, writes the former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, in his book Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel.   He describes how we ourselves may identify with Jesus’ sufferings on the cross and may be “consoled at the thought of God sharing in our suffering” through Jesus sufferings (p. 69).   Part of our sense of moving forward after Easter may include a sense of solidarity with Jesus;  God understands my sufferings through those of Jesus.  However, continues Williams, “it is precisely when Christ’s sufferings and mine are brought intimately together that the image of the crucified is indeed in danger of degradation.”  In this cosy identification between me and Jesus, if we don’t be careful, we can loose track of the real suffering of others.  “We (may) experience ourselves as sufferers, as victims,” continues Williams, “and so experience Christ’s cross as the symbol of who and what we are.  Jesus as victim is the image of myself as victim” (p. 69-70).   \\nWell, sometimes we are suffering….and we may very well feel victimized by our situation or by what someone has done to us.  The problem is how quickly we can move into: “my suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.”  And if we’re not careful, says Williams, “nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.”  This can sometimes happen in church conflicts.  And I think we are noticing some of this dynamic in the interchanges between current political candidates. \\nLest we point fingers, Williams includes most of us in this propensity to secure a righteous position for ourselves:  We find ourselves standing over and against the other, wearing the “moral armor of innocence” and often making ourselves the innocent victims in a given situation.  “Holy Week may invite us to a certain identification with the crucified,” concludes Williams, (but) “Easter firmly takes away a familiar ‘fellow-sufferer.’  Be it ongoing anti-Semitism in today’s world, continued devastation of our planet, denigrating Muslims or blaming others for church and family problems: It is so easy to slip into this “moral armor of innocence.”  \\nThe disciples encounter the Risen Jesus and are faced with their own lack of innocence.  They are confronted with their own culpability, their own passive participation in the violence that caused his death.  And they are faced with someone they don’t initially recognize, so caught up in their past actions and inactions, their sense of suffering and hopelessness.  “Easter,” says Rowan Williams, “means coming to the memory of Jesus, looking for consolation, and finding a memory that hurts and judges, that sets a distance, even an alienation between me and hope, my Savior.  Easter occurs, again and again, in this open-up of a void, the sense of absence which questions our egocentric aspirations and our longing for ‘tidy drama’; it occurs when we find in Jesus not a dead friend but a living stranger.” (p. 74)\\nAnd surprisingly, the stranger, the one we now recognize as the Risen Lord, again says:  “Peace be with you.  As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  So much is happening so quickly for his friends and followers.  He is not angry with them; he approaches them with a steady openness and compassionate words.  Might it be that this is how God is with each of us?  That our insistence on our own innocence, in face of our culpability is met with openness and compassion?  Or that our insistence on our own assumed guiltiness is met with the same openness and compassion?  Jesus breathes on them:  here the Gospel writer John uses an unusual form of the verb “to breath.”  Similar to that used when God breathes life into humans in the Genesis creation story, Jesus breath animates, enlivens, brings the disciples back from their wild swings between arrogant innocence or despairing remorse….back fro death. \\tSlowly it dawns on the people in the room, men and women alike, that Jesus has forgiven them.  He holds no grudge or resentment about their passive betrayal of him.  There, in his presence, they are not just remembering their dead friend but are now experiencing a living person.  One who is not quite the one they knew; he is yet a stranger.  He speaks again:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”  Would this be making any sense if they themselves were not experiencing Jesus’ love and forgiveness of their sorry selves, right in that moment?\\nAs the Church, we are the community in Jesus name; this is the part that later got the disciples trouble with the authorities.  “Stop using that name!  Don’t heal and teach in the name of Jesus!”  But the early disciples found themselves approached and forgiven by the presence of our Risen Lord.  We are a body of people who witness to this reality of forgiveness and renewal.  Called to be a place,  where others can come to meet the Risen Lord, again and again.  Where all of us are called out of our protective “armor of presumed innocence.”  \\nThat’s some of the “what now” after Easter.  We are called out of ourselves, of our past, beakoned into a future where the Risen Jesus is already ahead of us. Thanks be to God.  Amen.   ',\n",
       " '\\tBefore I came to serve as your interim minister over ago now, I was leading a United Church of Christ congregation in northern VA, in the suburbs right outside of Washington DC.  One of the members there shared an encounter with me that she had with her grandson who was active in our church ministries.  Having received her permission to share this story, I will tell you that this grandmother and her grandson were spending the day together one winter snow day, while his parents were at work.  Somehow they had gotten onto the topic of “currencies.”  An unusual conversation with even a precocious 6 year old.   After some discussion about how different countries have different types of currencies (dollars, yen, strings of shells, euros, pesos and such), the child decided to create some credit cards and debits cards.  Which are often our current currency of choice these days, at least the one obvious to our children.  After some mutual play with various pretend credit and debit cards, the boy announced it was time to make a “worship card.”  “Hmmmm…that’s interesting,” said Grandmother.  “Just what does a worship card do?”  “Well, you can use it to get things, like you can buy goats to send for Heifer project like we do at church” replied the child confidently, “You can get food for poor people with it.”   Apparently a loaded “worship card” can make good things happen and it is about getting things for other people.\\n\\n\\tHearing this story, I was struck by this boy’s insight into how a “worship card” might function.  This 6 year old, through his few years in worship, hearing numerous Children’s messages, involvement in Sunday School service projects, wider church food drives and meal packing for those in need, was on to something important about our life together as a church.  He knew that any “plastic” has to have something loaded on it, be it a debit card, a credit card, gift card, for it to be worth anything.   I suggest that a “loaded” worship card can do more than we know.  It provides certain value:  spiritual and emotional currency that, for starters, enables us to make life choices based on our values and beliefs.   Might we receive something to draw on, some newly imagined way of being in the world, because of our worship life together?  And….is this just about our own individual needs?   Is weekly corporate worship simply a spiritual “7-11” where we dip in for a quart of intellectual stimulation and a loaf of “feel good” inspiration?  Are we just privately “tanking up” here?\\n\\n\\tEach month in our church newsletter, I describe our weekly worship as “the heart of our life together” here at Falcon Heights Church.  What do we receive here in worship?  What value loads up for us on our “worship card,” that we don’t get elsewhere in our lives?   It makes good sense to say that, in worship, we learn more about what God cares about: the hurts and needs of the world, so we can go out and do something about being God’s healing partners.   But I also think that one of the most important things that get loaded up on our “worship card” is a deeper understanding about ourselves.  And it is that transformed understanding of ourselves that eventually starts to make a real difference in our lives.\\t\\n\\n\\tOur Biblical forbearers spent a lot of time asking God to clarify their current situation:  “are you still with us?” they would demand of God during difficult times.  “Things are a mess!  Who are we to you, chopped liver?”  In their worship and in their sacred writings, the community would recount where they had been and what it had meant:  wandering Aramaens were our father and mother and we were chosen as God’s own; we were slaves in Egypt and we were released and saved by God’s almighty hand; we were given a new land and taught to become a light of justice and compassion to all nations.  As followers of Jesus, you and I stand within this tradition of those who would look back and remind themselves of God’s claim on them.  In these words we just heard from the Jewish prophet Isaiah:  we have been taken by and kept by God, in spite of our failings. We too have been given a covenant to be that Light and to open the eyes of the blind, release the prisoners.  As we join in worship, week after week, singing, pondering, praying together, our “worship card” gets loaded-up with this deep awareness of who and whose we truly are.\\t\\n\\n\\tWhy does this matter?  Because the world so often tells us otherwise.  Our media tells us we are important if we look a certain way, are a certain age and own certain things.  Bosses tell us we matter based on our productivity.  Who are we; whose are we?  Are we owned by our work, our hobbies, our debts, our past failures or mistakes?  We come to worship and we hear a different message.  We are reminded that we are created, formed, redeemed, owned by God.  According to the prophet Isaiah, writing during the horrendous time of Israel’s capture and exile to Babylon in the 6th century BCE, we are each called by name:  “you are mine,” says God.   Whose are you, Anne?  Who names and claims you?  Well, I come from the Swallow clan, hardy New England stock, married into the Gillis clan, lived in a lot of places, sure do like to think that I own myself, have autonomy over myself, if I’m really honest.  Empowered and independent, I am! Don’t nobody own me! \\t\\n\\n\\tBut scripture seems to indicate otherwise:  “Anne, you are not your own.  Your are mine,” says God, “you are my Beloved daughter.”  All of us:  We are God’s off-spring, God’s children, sons, daughters of the living God.  When we baptize our little babies and our adults, when you and I worship together, Sunday after Sunday, we are loading up this identity awareness on our “worship card.”\\nEarly in the first decade of the first century, John the Baptist invited fellow Jews come to the rural outskirts of Jerusalem.  He challenged them to reflect and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized as a sign of the forgiveness of their sins, of the new life they were choosing. We have no idea what suddenly drew Jesus to do this public ritual, to emerge from an obscure youth and young adulthood, and align himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.   Did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  “Who am I, whose am I, why does it matter?” might he have asked himself?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually dry himself?   Was he seeking to quench some deeper thirst in those river waters, to ritually engage his past and his future as he entered into a dramatically public and dangerous path of teaching and healing?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  This Jesus who with baptism, knew himself to be worthy, loved and intimately connected to God, as he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”  Perhaps the question for each of us is similar:  Do we know ourselves to belong to God, to be beloved sons and daughters?  Do we truly experience that God is pleased with us?\\nThe rigors of Christian life, with the constant call to self-honesty, generosity, openness and inclusivity, can be overwhelming.   We load up our “worship card” each time we are together, with the stories of Jesus and the taste of God’s grace that we receive in one another’s’ presence.  In worship together, we re-imagine another possible world of justice and peace.  We hear again that God is pleased with us, just the way we are….and that God desires more from us than to stay just the way we are.  In baptism we receive the watery mark of God’s grace and we come to the Table to receive the taste and texture of God’s extravagant welcome.  Through these sacraments, these holy acts, we boldly remember we are identified individually, named, by the Mysterious Creator of the Universe, and that this reality lays claim on us.  We load up our “worship card” as we remember whose we are.  And we once again head out into the world, strengthened and empowered by the value on that card.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tHow do we know that God might be communicating with any of you, and that you might be able to receive a vision of what this church is called to next?\\nPerhaps we resist the idea that God might be speaking to us because we just don’t feel worthy of such intimate attention from the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe.  Who, me?  Or, perhaps we don’t much favor the idea of God directly communicating with us because we are a tad nervous about parts of our lives that God might want us to change.  Or, perhaps we have been so shaped by the radical individualism of our culture, admonished to pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps all our lives, that we want God worry about the people who are really in need.  We may take pride in our sense of autonomy and competence; frankly, we are not much interested in sharing the power of our lives, and we can’t really imagine what it might look like to be a co-partner with God in our lives.  It is up to us to get things done.  Period.  This is a common stance among good, productive, intelligent people and in a lot of churches.   It’s tempting isn’t it, when faced with “What the church should be doing next?”  We’ll figure this out on our own, God, we have a lot of bright people here who know how organizations should work!  And that new, young pastor we call will have lots of ideas and tons of pizazz!  We’re covered!\\n\\tUnderstandable.   And, this is exactly why I need the Biblical stories and perspective in my life, even the unsettling texts like this from the Gospel of Mark.  The letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament, speaks of scripture as having the capacity to do some real “spiritual surgery” on us.  Not in the manner you might think, of judgement and condemnation, which is certainly easy to dismiss as too shaming and not good for our self-esteem.  But where are you and I held accountable for our choices, our very lives?  Where do we get a wider perspective beyond our own autonymous and clever ideas?  Where do we get a bigger picture of this church’s future beyond beefing up kids’ programming and repairing our building?  What would those things make possible?  This is where we need scripture.  “Indeed,” writes the author of Hebrews, “the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joins from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”  We read the ancient scriptures of our Christian tradition not to condemn us (Susan R. Andrews, p. 162, B, Vol. 4, Feasting on the Word), but as one Biblical commentator has described: to “cut away the veneer of self-absorbed living.”  Ouch.\\n\\tToday’s encounter between Jesus and the rich man, like other ancient Biblical writings of parables, myths, history, laws, poetry, has the power to do some serious “piercing” if we are willing to let it.  Texts like these can nudge me out of my self-absorption, and a part of me doesn’t like that.  It’s embarrassing to have to be reminded that God’s universe is bigger than my perspectives, my experience, my brain.  We look to the Biblical stories to get some wider view on what God might be calling this church to next.  And today’s story from the Gospel of Mark has some strong words for us about our money, our giving, our generosity, our sense of identity.  \\n\\n\\tWe re-enter the scene and watch Jesus and his followers set out to resume their journey to Jerusalem. They are headed to the center of first century Jewish life and worship, but apparently have stopped in some town in Judea for a spell.  It’s probably early in the morning; best to get going in the cool of the day. \\nI imagine a flurry of goodbyes, hugs, departing words, hearty slaps on the shoulder.  And suddenly, in the midst of the departure commotion, a man runs up to Jesus.  He appears out of nowhere and quickly kneels at Jesus’ feet:  “Good Teacher,” he breathlessly pants, “what….what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  Who is this guy?  The text says he isn’t standing before Jesus, but is kneeling.  Whenever the Gospel of Mark describes someone as coming for healing or the healing of a loved one, they are depicted as kneeling before Jesus.  That’s the first thing to wonder about:  what does this stranger want healed?  We are not sure.  Next, notice what he asks Jesus:  “what do I have to do to inherit eternal life?”  I suggest we be careful NOT to assume the man is asking how to get to heaven and stay out of hell.  Most Jews during the time of Jesus already believed in the eternal soul that would continue living in the World to Come following their death.  Jewish tradition focused on ethical and holy living in the present as part of being in covenant with God, not for reward.  So, What is he asking for?   \\n\\tI think the man is asking Jesus how to get or achieve something in the present.  Remember that he is kneeling.  The man (we have yet to find out that he is rich) is asking for some kind of healing:  inherit eternal life.  The fellow drops to his knees, in a “heal me” position and asks about what he needs to do, now, today.\\n\\tWatch what Jesus does with the question.  As he often responds to a serious issue, Jesus goes side-ways and deals with it indirectly.  Jesus starts by challenging the man on his use of the title “Good Teacher.”  “Why do you call me good?  No one is good but God alone.”  Now that’s interesting.  Jesus could have added, “and you are asking me about how you are to be good?  or gooder?  So you can get something?”  Jesus quickly runs through a number of the traditional commandments from the their shared Jewish tradition, familiar to us as Christians.  “You want to do something; well, pay attention to your tradition; all this is totally doeable!”  “But Teacher,” replies the man, “I have kept all these commandments since my youth.”  I don’t think the guy is bragging; he is just clarifying.  What he doesn’t say, but I wonder if he was thinking:  “Jesus, I need some deeper healing here; I am a good and moral person…but something is not right in me.”  Hmmm.  I can relate to this: I am pretty much a good and moral person, but there are days when if I’m really honest with myself and God, something is not quite right with me, some deeper healing is needed in order for me to live more abundantly…I ache for greater self-awareness, with deeper joy and serenity, with more compassion, with increased eagerness to serve others, with a heightened sense of God’s presence.  Perhaps you too know this ache deep inside.\\n\\tWatch the text here for what happens next.  Verse 21.  Hear the words and imagine the action: “Jesus, looking at him, loved him.”  In the original language of the Gospels, Aramaic, the words mean, Jesus gazed at him, straight in the eye, and with great tenderness, compassion, love.  No judgment here. What did Jesus see?  What was Jesus responding to in this man?  I think of myself when I am flailing around inside my head; what to do next, how to handle this or that, how to fix my worried, grasping, hard-working, anxious self.  I try to imagine Jesus looking at me.  Next time you find yourself in that place, of overwhelm, of How-in-the-world-can-I-do-this-better, differently, imagine Jesus gazing at you, quietly, with reassuring compassion.  And then….well, to be blunt, here comes the spiritual surgery part. I am not sure what news God will have for me in my next overwhelmed and panicked moment, or what news God will have for you, but if it’s anything like what Jesus tells the rich man….hang on to your hats!  God’s news, God’s words to us. can cut us to the quick.  Which apparently, is just what needs to happen.\\n\\tI think sometimes we want the Bible to be all about judgment and condemnation, so we can reject the challenges.  What does Jesus say to the man kneeling before him, who pleads for a healing of his present, of his immediacy?  With great love, Jesus says: “You lack one thing…are you ready?  This will heal you:  go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”  What?  That is the prescribed treatment:  surgery, cutting off the guy’s tremendous wealth AND interacting with the poor to give it to them.  “When the man heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.”   The man asks for the next things he should do.   Jesus, a spiritual surgeon if we have ever seen one, cuts deep.  And he doesn’t just tell the man to get rids of his possessions.  Jesus tells the man to give the proceeds from selling his belongings to the poor.   Now, we can understand how this might be healing for people living in poverty.  But how is this going to heal the rich man?  I wonder if what Jesus is really telling the man is this:  what you need to do is change your relationship with the poor.  Give to the poor, by connecting with them.  Don’t just send your money through a non-profit.  Go, and interact with them and know them and learn to receive from them.  This is going to heal you.\\n\\tThe man is shocked.  He leaves the scene, grieving.  So, what was hurting inside the rich man?  Surely he wasn’t hungry, nor was his family if he had one.  He wasn’t plagued with anxieties about providing for people he loved.  His wealth would have given him certain prestige and power in his community.  Those around him, according to the religious custom of the day, would have viewed his riches as a sign of God’s blessing.  \\n\\t How is giving of our money related to our spiritual healing?  To the spiritual healing of this congregation?  These are questions worth exploring, talking and praying about together as a church.  As the man walked away, Jesus looked around, and remarked to his disciples:  “how hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the Kingdom of God!”  For Jesus, the concern is always about the now, about helping people enter into the realm of God, experience abundant life, in the present.  Amen.',\n",

       " '\\tGreetings and peace to you, in the name of Jesus the Christ!  My name is Matthew and I come to you from the distant first century world to tell you about why Jesus was born!   I’ve been visiting around your town the last few days and noticing nativity scenes springing up, outside churches and in smaller creches in your homes.  I love how you 21st century people have woven parts of my version of the birth story with the Gospel writer’s Luke’s version in your manger scenes!  What?!  There are two birth stories about Jesus?  Ah…..that’s why Pastor Anne invited me today….I hear she invited Mark to speak last week, but for some reason he didn’t include any of these great stories in his gospel.  So today you get to hear more about these birth stories….and maybe see where you might fit into them.  \\n\\tI never met Jesus in person.  Does that surprise you?  Church tradition has said that the authors of Matthew Mark Luke and John were all disciples of Jesus.  Uh….not possible.  Jesus was arrested and killed before most of us were born!  But so many stories about him and his teachings were passed down by his family, by his friends after the Jesus kept reappearing after they thought he was dead.  Those who started to follow his Way treasured his teachings and healing stories and remembered them. Then people started to write them down, but not until decades after he died!  I read Mark’s gospel by the way, and filched about 95% of his material…..and then added some of my own from other sources that unknown to the Biblical scholars!  But here’s the thing: what we all wrote about Jesus was NOT meant to be an eyewitness account, like a journalist might write in the newspaper or on-line today.  We were doing something else.  See, as we were each writing our Gospels, we were experiencing the presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst of our faith communities!  Jesus wasn’t someone who just lived long ago.  The Risen Jesus Christ, Hebrew for Messiah, was an active presence in our life together.  Our relationship with his living spirit was challenging and changing us everyday!  The other gospel writers and I were trying to describe this reality, something so huge, we often had to resort to metaphor, poetry, symbolic language.  I have heard that your Native American storytellers say, “this may not be exactly how it happened, but I know that it is true.”  Like any really important story, we were trying to give you the bigger picture….of something that really was quite amazing and even mysterious.  Why was Jesus born?  What was God up to here?  Why did Jesus have such a powerful effect on people?  \\n\\tThrough the style of my writings, and the events I refer to, Biblical scholars figure I wrote my book in around 80 or 90 CE.  They can also tell that I am a Jewish, Greek speaking, Christian. I lived in Antioch, on the border of present day Turkey and Syria.  Busy cosmopolitan area, on the ancient Silk Route, and was filled with both Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity.  But I am Jewish in origin; some people think I was a Pharisee, an expert on Jewish law, Torah and how to apply it to everyday life.  I wrote this gospel to say that “this man Jesus is the one we, the Jewish community, have been waiting for all these years…this is the Messiah….the one who will come to save Israel.” That’s why I quote the Hebrew scriptures, what you call the Old Testament, so much throughout my book. I wanted to remind my people to know that God was still doing mighty works and divine disclosures in their midst.\\n\\tWhen I tell this to modern day churches, some people say they are wary of sounding so presumptuous; they hesitate to say God is doing this or that in their midst.  I tell them: Oh, come on! Don’t be so tentative and polite!  You are not running a civic organization or a social fraternity, this is the Body of Christ here at the corner of West 2nd and _____3rd!  Claim God’s mighty works in your midst! The gradual healing following painful conflict, the signs of forgiveness and revitalized ministries that goes on in the midst this place…..claim it!  I hear that you are learning from your history, you’re discerning what God is calling this church to next, getting clear about your values, shared beliefs and vision, setting priorities about what God wants you to do next, and pledging financial resources towards that future.    How wonderfully bold and risky of all of you!\\n\\tWhat I love about the Jesus’ birth story is that God seems to use all kinds of everyday people who are wiling to do bold and risky things.   To illustrate this, I do include some extravagant details in my birth narrative, I must say.  Careful not to get caught up in a literal interpretation; you’ll miss the point.  All these colorful details have important symbolic meaning. Angels!  Wild dreams! Unlikely parents!   Long journey and miraculous birth! A star!  Exotic wise men from the East!  A wicked king!  Action, camera – is that how you say it?!  Actually, only Luke and I include details of Jesus’ birth in our gospels.  We both believe that the most important moment in Jesus’ earthly life, when he actually became the Son of God, was at his conception.   But instead of dwelling on Mary, like Luke does, I focus my story Joseph, the brave Jewish man who becomes Jesus’ earthly father. \\nBut was Joseph actually Jesus’ father?  Hmmmmm…… Did you know that in my time, Jewish law dictated that paternity was based on the man’s acknowledgement of the child?  If a man takes his betrothed to live in his parent’s home (the final stage of getting married) and assumes responsibility for a mother and a child, he is the father.  If a man goes so far as to name a child, as the angel directed Joseph to do, the man was acknowledging that baby as his own.  Now any one of you who have adopted a child, or served as a step-parent, will know what I am talking about.  I guess I really admired Joseph, being that he could have simply divorced Mary without a lot of fuss.  But he sensed that God was calling him to more than just familiar legal requirements.  God was asking him to take a risk and make a decision before all the information was there.  Come to think of it, I guess this happens to all of us, sometimes, doesn’t it?  We feel we have to take a risk and make a decision before we know all of the consequences.  As a church, you all have to start trusting each other again before there is evidence this is a good idea!  You will eventually choose a new pastor to be your preacher and teacher, but you will not know this person fully.  I hear you a putting some new policies in place to better help you navigate life together as a congregation.  But who knows what will happen next?  Risky business, this Jesus stuff, I must say.  \\n\\tBefore I go, I have to mention those strange people who came from the east to visit Jesus in Bethlehem.  And what about this awful King Herod?  Pastor Anne will tell you more about why I included this cruel puppet ruler of the Roman occupiers, during her January 5 sermon celebrating the Feast of Epiphany.  But the star, I have to tell you about this really cool detail!  In ancient times, important people’s birth was often heralded by an astronomical surprise: a comet’s sudden appearance, the alignment of two planets in a blazing orb.  I meant for these exotic visitors to remind people of Zoroastrian priests from Persia, who had a special group of starwatchers called the magi.  For my congregation at the end of the first century, folks like this were considered definitely outside the fold.  See, my church community was starting to welcome new people into its midst, like Greek speaking gentiles that we Jewish folks didn’t really know or understand at first.  But the magi were some of the first to recognize who Jesus was!  \\n\\tI wanted to show and inspire my own people how humble, fallible and unexpected folks can take risks to be part of God’s work in the world.  Hopefully this inspires you too!  I’m glad you still read my birth stories about how seemingly insignificant people can end up playing huge roles in God’s intentions.  Think about that next time you feel insignificant or like you have made some bad mistakes in your life. It’s true you know, God can work through any of us.   \\t \\t\\n  hiWhat a pleasure to time-travel and speak with you today.  A blessed Advent to you!  Amen.\\n\\t   hi',\n",
       " '\\tOur reading from John’s gospel brings us a celebratory, joyous story of about a marriage feast.  And who doesn’t like a great, big wedding reception?  Except maybe the person paying for the festivities; formal wear tends to feel constricting, neckties and high-heels and such.  And relationships with new in-laws may feel tenative.   A few family members may be fuming that the wedding ceremony was held on the beach or all places. Or that it incorporated elements from some other spiritual tradition.   Or that there were two brides instead of a bride and a groom for goodness sake!  Not to mention that at many receptions, somebody invariably drinks too much.  But usually, we all hang in there for a time of feasting and dancing, delighting in the couples love-glow and having a roaring good time.  Thank goodness, most of our wedding receptions don’t go on for a week like they did in Jesus’ time.   Seems so over-the-top!\\n\\tBut for some reason, the gospel writer John frames Jesus first public action in the context of an over-the-top, seven-day wedding party.  As 21 century listeners of the story, it is easy to get stuck on the miracle question as we weave our way through the text.  Did it really happen like that?  Six huge 20-30 gallon jars filled with water and suddenly turned into wine?  What?  Even one cup of water shape-shifting into wine throws off our scientific sensibilities. Matter just doesn’t spontaneously change like that, according to our current laws of physics.  Unless of course we are replicating beverages on the Starship Enterprise, as suggested in the futuristic TV series Star Trek.  We may struggle with whether this is literal or symbolic language.  Whatever it is, this story is John’s introduction to the public ministry and works of Jesus.  It is the inaugural story that John tells us about Jesus.  In the midst of a wedding celebration Jesus works a sign of such over-the-top extravagance that his disciples believe in him.  \\n\\tPerhaps the first question, then, is why does the Gospel writer start here? What does the sign, this miracle, point to and what does it mean?  Just what do the disciples end up believing about him?   That Jesus, whoa, now THERE is one amazing wine-maker!? What does the Gospel writer hope will happen in us as we hear the story?  What’s the invitation here and how might we respond?\\n\\tWhen we are faced with a thorny Biblical story, it helps to consider the context in which we are encountering the narrative.  First, we hear it with some perspective on the author’s context: a late first century church where the debate and tension between new Jewish and Greek followers of Jesus, and the wider Jewish community that did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, was intensifying. We may bring an understandable skepticism about any of the Biblical miracle stories; they can irritate or even hook us, making it hard to get at what the Gospel writer is really doing.  We also hear today’s story with the wider context of our own personal lives and whatever is going on in your head at the moment.  Sure could use a miracle in my life today, God, or don’t you do those anymore?  And we hear this story within the context of our wider world.  I’m thinking particularly of our annual acknowledgement of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr’s birthday; the complicated state of disarray in our nation when it comes to racial disparity around employment, housing, healthcare and the criminal justice system.  \\n\\tWe bring all this to the text, including a certain degree of  cynicism and despair over God’s power to change difficult realities in our lives.   I suggested last week that in weekly worship we can begin to imagine a different world, as we interact with the ancient text.  One more birthday commemoration for Dr. King: Might we be hearing today’s Biblical texts with ears attuned to new beginnings, a new era where Dr. King’s values, the values of God’s reign of peace and justice, are freshly embraced and fulfilled?  \\n \\tJohn’s story of a marriage feast and abundant wine draws on ancient Biblical symbols of the joyous arrival of God’s reign among the people.  For all that has happened in our violence-torn and polarized world this last week, the Biblical word remains among us:  God is hughly generous and God’s reign of extravagance is breaking in upon us.   As the prophet Isaiah described it in the 6th century BCE, where once the Jewish nation was called “Forsaken” and “Desolate,” they would now be called God’s “Delight” and their land will be called “Married.”  Are these Biblical writers dense, naively optimistic?  Their historical era was no picnic. Weren’t they aware of the violence and poverty and suffering all around them?  \\n\\tIn today’s text, we learn first that Jesus’ mother is at a wedding, and almost as an afterthought, Jesus and some of his early followers are also in attendance.  Apparently, Jesus was known for enjoying a good party, and would later be described by his foes as a glutton and wine-bibber.  This story may bring us equal amounts of the human Jesus, as well as his divine powers and glory.   John starts by describing that Jesus’ unnamed mother notices that the wine has run out, which is a curious detail.  But she will be one of the few faithful disciples John describes as being at the foot of the cross when Jesus is execution..  Even before the wine-steward has spoken to the party host, the bridegroom, Mary is on to it and this attention to detail jump-starts her son’s public ministry.  Pulling Jesus aside, she whispers, “they have no wine.”  His reply sounds harsh, but in the original tongue of Aramaic it not rudeness but neutral disengagement.  “Woman, of what concern is that to you and me?  My hour has not yet come.”  Bells would go off in John’s early readers with this word:  “hour.”  Like marriage feasts and good wine, “the hour” was a common Jewish metaphor of escatological fulfillment.  The future end time when God’s justice would rule the world in peace and well-being for all.   “Not yet,” Jesus is saying.  Is he reluctant, or just being timely, according to God’s plan?  We don’t know.  But what happens next is that the faithful disciple, his mother, initiates a subtle protest and a blatant nudge.  She turns to the servers, saying: “do whatever he tells you.”   I love this part.  Maybe what we are to do as followers is to trust that God wants our joy and delight, symbolized by the wine.  And perhaps we are even called to sometimes protest and to nudge God.  (Feasting on the Word, Year C, Volume I, Carol Lakely Hess, p. 262.)\\n\\tSix big stone containers are standing near-by, 20-30 gallons each, used for Jewish rites of washing and purification.  All empty.  Is John symbolically telling us there is emptiness in the religious practice of the day?  That something new needs to be added?  It would be no accident that John may be picking up on the growing family fight between the Jewish synagogues and the emerging Christian communities.  It is important to not denigrate the state of first century Jewish religion, but to see Jesus as an in-house reformer.  But notice how the details start to become extreme.  “Fill the jars with water,” Jesus directs the servants.  This is a massive amount of liquid; around 150 gallons!  A lot of trips to the well.  “And draw them out and take them to the chief steward.”  Which they do, and the oblivious guests are quite pleased because the wine is delicious.  The chief steward gets stuck where we do, trying to come up for a reason that explains the miracle of this tremendous vintage (he has to have known the wine ran-out):  “oh, I get it, you are SUCH a generous bridegroom, you have saved the best for last!  How wonderful!”  \\n\\tWould John have us know that Jesus is the new bridgegroom, coming to marry, to partner with and fulfill humanity?  Only Jesus’ disciples, his mother and these other unnamed followers get it.  This sign, says this Gospel writer, is to reveal God’s glory and the breaking in of God’s reign.  And Jesus is the one who reveals this.  This is the one.  And the disciples believe it. \\nThe Biblical narrative challenges us with a vision of God’s forward motion in history, God’s call to action to each of us.  “Do what he tells you to do,” says Mary.  She also reminds me that we need to keep talking with God, protesting to God amidst the brokenness of our world.  Like Mary bugging Jesus, to keep nudging God.  As the Psalmist declares: God’s steadfast love brings the all people into an abundant feast where they “drink from the river of (God’s) delights ” (Psalm 36).  As Isaiah reminds us, and all shall be joined together again, our land “married.”  Jesus gallon creates over 150 gallons of wine: an extravagant almost senseless abundance.  But a vision worthy of God’s purposes, filled with the spilling over of both compassion and joy. How we might share God’s delight, God’s hope in us, with others?  For this challenge and this ministry, thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tHearing today’s Biblical reading, I’m experiencing a bit of scriptural whiplash!  First, there’s a tiny baby in the manger, fleeing with his parents to Egypt to avoid the murderous reach of a threatened King Herod.  When the coast is clear after Herod’s death, Joseph and Mary head back north with toddler Jesus in town, settling in Nazareth.  But then, the Gospel writer Matthew fast-forwards about 30 years.   Jesus boyhood? Teen years?  Twenty-somethings?  Nothing.  Sunddenly, we find Jesus’ cousin and adult contemporary, John the Baptist wildly preaching a life-style and heart-focus turnaround.  Historically, it’s a time of continued harsh life under Roman rule, political repression with wide variety of religious responses in the early first century Jewish community.   John’s answer to this mess?   “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven, God’s here-and-now reign of justice and mercy, is NOW.”  And out of nowhere it seems, adult Jesus is in this region right outside of Jersualem, and he steps forward to be baptized by John.  Why?  John gives a few hints: I baptize with water.  One is coming soon who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.    \\n\\tAs we meet the adult Jesus through the eyes of the Gospel writer Matthew, I’ve tried to imagine what this encounter by the river meant to Jesus.  As he later taught and healed through the region, what were Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan?  Did he think back to that day as a quiet, solo event, just him and this strange, wild preacher, as the Matthew describes it?  Or did he remember standing at the end of a long line of jostling people, pressing ahead towards the water, eager to enter the waters of renewal, as described in the Gosple of Luke?  Was Jesus decision to be immersed in the flowing river, a sign of letting the old Jesus fall away and a new person emerge?  Was it an impetuous decision?  Or was it the culmination of years of spiritual training, as some scholars now suggest; being mentored by John in a desert religious community?  Perhaps the culmination of esoteric, mystical Jewish teachings, beliefs that God’s reign of peace would only emerge if the people themselves were repentant and let lives of righteousness and mercy?  Did the deepening sense of self-awareness of his call, of who God had created him to be, propel him forward to express this publically?  In his full humanness, he may not have had some grand plan or solid inner conviction.  Perhaps it was only after this event that the sense of who he was, of what he was to do with his adult life, slowly started to emerge.  \\n\\t  How do any of us figure out who we are and why we are here on earth? I would say that we grapple with this question all our lives, in different ways at different ages.   The questions of who we are touches us at many levels: how do I connect with my family history, what does my perceived gender mean to me, how do I express my inner sense of being a boy or a girl, a man or a woman, who am I physically attracted to, what do I value and believe, what the heck am I supposed to do with my life?  \\n\\tWhen we are very young, it’s all a strange mixture of bonding with others, connecting to other living creaters such as humans, animals, the natural world, and learning that we are a separate human being in ourselves.  As a baby, I may reach out to grab my sister’s long hair and discover, wonder of wonders, that it is not an extension of my hand!  The tempting, silky hair is actually connected to a separate person who yells loudly when I yank it!  Slowly, we learn to tame and channel our impulses, learning respect for the other that is not me.  But who are we?  Our parents, our religious community, our school, our peers start telling us who they are, through what they say and mostly through their behavior.  They encourage, and sometimes insist, that we be like them, share their values, their aspirations, and their dreams for us.  Which isn’t a bad thing; given encouragement and some freedom, we get a chance to try on different values and beliefs.  Hmmmm…..this is me!   Ooooohhh….this is not me!   \\n\\tWhat the Biblical tradition suggests and models is that we don’t go through this process on just a human level.  We are created by God and come here, as one contemporary theologian describes it, with the divine in our DNA.  We are somehow wired with this connection to God as part of who we are.  (Richard Rohr).  But if the Christian Church only talks about building human community and helping other needy humans, we have lost the core of who we are as humans.  Our young people might do well to ask us, “what’s God got to do with all of this?”   What does the presence of an active, transformative power do in our lives, and how does it connect to who we are?  Let’s hear the Biblical witness echoed in this beloved Baptismal song.  I invite us to sing and ponder these words as spoken by the living God in our midst.  We join together in hymn #351, remaining seated and singing verses 1 and 2.\\n\\tI hear accompaniment in these words.  Jesus not only taught, but modeled in the way he was with other people, how it is that God is with us.  Loving, non-judgemental but holding us accountable.  God with us at birth, goes the song.  God there in the future, God rejoicing and guiding and cheering us on.   Locating us in a relationship, rooting us in connection that goes beyond the human level; unseen, dynamic, mysterious accompaniment.  We are not alone.   Ahhh….but most of the time we engage our lives, and understand who we are, like we are doing a solo act.\\n\\tHow does this happen? Within this predominate culture, we begin a slow but steady process of identitying ourselves by what we are able to achieve and produce.  It seems to happen at a younger and younger age; achievement or non-achievement - academics, sports, creative activities - start to define us.  As adults, we naturally seek success and recognition through our work, our hobbies or community and church involvement, our healthy and successful children.  None of these are bad in themselves. But the pursuit of all this does an interesting thing to our self-identity.  We begin to buy into the assumption that we are what we do, and that we are “self-made.”   God has little to do with it.  In a predominate culture such as our’s that values productivity, we begin to define ourselves by what we are producing.    \\n\\tIt becomes hard to not produce.  To sit still.  To just be.  To pray, to meditate, to watch the clouds, to ponder “Who am I, why am I really here?”  It can become an especially painful question, if we aren’t quite making it in this world of material success.  What is my identity, what is my worth?  And it also becomes problematic as we age, and are not longer particulary productive in a way we once were.  What is my identity, my value, now?   As people who seek to follow Jesus, as seekers and servants growing in God’s transforming love, this is a crucial question that needs to be addressed in some counter-cultural ways.  Meaning, our predominant culture is not going to be much help. In fact actually hinders our ever arriving at a meaningful and life-giving sense of who we are and what the heck we are doing here.\\n\\tI find the teachings of The Rev. Cynthia Bourgeault to be helpful at this point.  An Episcopal priest and author, Bourgeault is one of the most practical down-to-earth mystics I have ever encountered.  She writes: (in her book Centering Prayer and Inner Awakening):  “Like most great spiritual masters of our universe, Jesus taught from the conviction that we human beings are victims of a tragic case of mistaken identity.  The person I normally take myself to be – that busy, anxious little “I” so preoccupied with its goals, fears, desires and issues – is never even remotely the whole of who I am.  And to seek the fulfillment of my life at this level means to miss out on a bigger life.”  (p. 10)\\n\\tAgain, nothing wrong with “goals, fears, desires and issues” in our lives.  But as defining the totality of who we are?  It produces, as Jesus taught, “a case of mistaken identity.”   “The one who tries to hold on to his/her life is the one who loses it,” he will teach.  “The one who let’s go, who loses, his/her life will save it.”  Grasping at what? Letting go of what?  Could it be that Jesus, not unlike spiritual masters in other traditions, knew that “the core illusion of the human condition was confusion between our small sense of self” and a “larger/essential/real self.”  Mistaking the goals of rugged individualism and materialism of our predominant culture as a guide to who we really are.   Perhaps church is the place where we might not only learn how to love one another, but learn how to “die to self” as the apostle Paul put it.  To let go of that attachment to the ego part of us that is so overly identified by what we do.\\n\\tIn Jesus, we meet someone who so was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  And it starts with Jesus himself, who knew himself to be worthy, loved and intimately connected to God.   “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased,” he hears as he emerges from the water.  Perhaps the question for each of us is similar:  Do we know ourselves to belong to God, to be beloved sons and daughters?  Might we learn that God is pleased with us now and through-out our lives?  Join with me in singing the final two verses of “I Was There to Hear Your Borning Cry.”',\n",
       " 'In the middle of all this, Jesus spots this blind man.  After some back and forth with his followers about just why this man might be blind, Jesus stops talking.  He stoops down, spits on the ground, scoops up some of this muddy mess and without asking, spreads it on the man’s eyes.  “Go wash your eyes in the pool of Siloam,” he tells the man.  “I can see, I can see,” the man cries.  Throughout the ensuing hubbub this healing act causes, Jesus weaves through themes of blindness, seeing, and his being “the light of the world.”   Everyone has different points of view on what it means to be blind, the implications of being healed, and just who this person Jesus really is.   But in the midst of the commotion of jossling pilgrims, the drama of splashing water dousing the Temple altar and the blaze of the giant lampstands, Jesus claims something new about both sight and light.  What do we make of this?\\n\\tAnd what are we to make of this healing story in the middle of a pandemic?  In the middle of this frightening time in our community, our nation and our world when healing from covid-19 seems like a distant fever dream?  How do we consider healing, surviving and getting back to normal when the huge wave of inevitable illness hasn’t visibly reach our community yet?  How will we heal the disruptions in our lives and the anxiety that haunts our dreams in these days?  We are unable to see ahead into an uncertain future. It’s as though a certain blindness has befallen all of us.  We can’t quite perceive what is happening around us.  \\nIn Jesus’ time, blindness was considered a disfigurement and public punishment. It meant you had sinned and were unfit for worship in the Temple or being around other people.  You became an outcast in your community.  Some of this undercurrent exists in our day.  For starters, we’re experiencing various forms of “blaming the victims” with this current worldwide medical emergence.  Our leaders use an outdated racist phrase such as “the China virus.”  We tend to blame travel plans for an individual’s illness.   We become suspicious of one another.\\nAncient Hebrews scriptures did encourage people to have compassion on those who lived with the condition of blindness.  Jewish law instructed them to “invite the blind to your feasts.”   And by the time of the prophets, we find references to the Messianic age where the God of compassion will make the blind to see, release the captives, feed the hungry, bind up the brokenhearted.  The talk of blaming someone for personal misfortune ceases, as the prophets talk about God’s compassionate actions breaking into history, changing corrupt systems and healing community.  Jesus will use these same images to speak of the coming Kingdom of God.  \\nGod made us with vulnerable bodies, but also declared it “good.” Decline and dying is part of our creatureliness.   And here we are, as has happened throughout human history, with an expected but natural emergence of a new and powerful virus that is challenging our bodies’ defenses and our health systems’ preparedness.  And, as never before, we are a world-wide population constantly on the move, inter-connected at a level we never thought possible.   We are befuddled, annoyed and unsettled by these present circumstances.  It is understandable that we each may be having trouble perceiving appropriately.  Much is clouded in uncertainty.\\nPerhaps we are a bit like this cast of characters in today’s story, who were each disrupted and irritated by this physical change in this man, with his change in status from blind to sighted.  Something is new here that just is not visible to them.    They all have different concerns about this healing act and they each have a survival agenda.  People don’t always react well when the way forward is uncertain.  And Jesus wanted God to be glorified.  God to be acknowledged and celebrated in a healing that involved not just body renewal.  The man’s status changed; it opened up his reconnecting and a healing of community ties.  The man is restored to sight AND to his wider community.\\nSo something is afoot for all of us in this pandemic.  We are surrounded by uncertainty and cannot clearly see ahead into the future.  And yet, and yet, God is at work among us.  I’ve been thinking about how the British author, C.S. Lewis, spoke of the simple gifts that can be there in the middle of dark times.  He called them “patches of Godlight in the woods of our experience”  (Letters to Malcolm, p. 120).  Lewis asked: How might our vision be changed so we see not just this present difficulty and loss, but a wider picture.”  I wonder, how will we re-envision community connections and acts of compassion in these days?\\nJesus was not just a healer of bodies.  He wanted us to truly see,“Godlight” all around us.  In acts of compassion, in reframing of what it means to be community.  “Patches of Godlight” will continue to spring up all around us, everyday in the midst of this hot mess, if we will just look.   The Spirit of Jesus, the healer, moves among us, even now, widening our vision of God’s compassionate presence in all that is.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.',\n",
       " '\\tLet’s move back into the scene in the synagogue and see if we can figure out what the great teacher of “loving our neighbors as ourselves” is doing… besides raising people’s hackles.   In the beginning of his ministry, Jesus traveled around speaking in different synagogues throughout Galilee.  In this story, he returns to his hometown Nazareth and attends worship in the synagogue with what are probably family and neighbors.  Like other men in the community, he takes a turn reading from the Hebrew scriptures; his portion is from the prophet Isaiah.  It tells about the Messiah, the expected savior of Israel who will bring good news of rescue to the poor, and release to the captives, and healing to the blind, all signs of God’s in-breaking reign of mercy and justice.  Jesus has just sat down, everyone is staring at him, and he has said, rather astoundingly to those assembled, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  Hmmmm… …murmur several people, interesting….isn’t this Joseph’s son?  Can’t you see them nudge each other: “I remember when he was just a boy, helping in his father’s carpenter shop!”  No one seems too disturbed at this point.  But then Jesus launches into this rambling diatribe, accusing the congregation that they are getting ready to oppose him.  He even puts words in their mouth.  He suggests they will demand some kind of favoritism, special miracles like he did in other towns, because he their home-town man.  \\n\\tThen, Jesus finishes off this rude assault with provocative references to several great Jewish prophets:  Elijah and Elisha, each who brought God’s mercy and compassion to outsiders.  This what finally ticks off the Nazareth crowd, because these are references to their history when they, the chosen people, did not seem to be favored.  In the first case, the prophet Elijah ignored needy Israelite widows during a famine and brought aid to a Phoenician widow, restoring and empowering her to new life.  In the second, the prophet Elisha chose among many needy lepers to heal a Syrian military commander of his leprosy, restoring and empowering him to new life.   The widow and the commander were both Gentiles, outsiders.  The healing power of God’s kingdom is to extend to those we consider to be outsiders, is what Jesus is really saying.  \\n\\tAnd the people get it and they are “filled with rage.”   Why so angry? When the marginalized are truly empowered, it tends to change the status quo.  Our resistance to this, as the insiders, seems naturally ingrained, because it may  mean loss of advantage and priviledge.    No wonder the crowd wants to get rid of him.  How do we deal with this natural tendency in ourselves?\\n\\tRowan Williams, former Archbishop of Cantebury and  head of the Anglican Church has been known for inviting outsiders into conversation.  He would invite those out on the edges of British society and outside the Anglican church, into open dialogue about spirituality and faith.  Out of these experiences, he wrote Tokens of Trust: An Introduction to Christian Belief.  In his writings, he focuses on the idea that belief is more an act of trust than intellectual assent.  Belief is less about a right or wrong set of ideas; it’s about an action, a trusting. For Rowan Williams, belief in God is trust in a loving relationship; a trust that in some essential way, we are held safe.  Not a fantasy safety where we will never be ill or injured or die.  But an inner awareness of an anchorage, a refuge, that holds our very being.  He makes an unusual comparison between Christian affirmation or belief in a loving God with the “formula used by Buddhists when they make their statement of common purpose to their community: (A Buddhist will say) ‘I take refuge in the Buddha’, meaning, “the Buddha is where I belong, the Buddha is what I have confidence in to keep me safe.” What Williams is getting at is that our beliefs aren’t primarily intellectual ideas; they are really descriptions of a place, an inner anchorage in love, where we “find solid ground, home.”   “In you, O Lord, I take refuge,” wrote the Psalmist years ago.  What a marvelous breath-prayer to take into our week:  “In you” (inhale and pause).  “I take refuge “ (exhale and pause). \\nJesus seemed to sense his eternal refuge in God’s love; it’s what enabled him to do his ministry of teaching and healing in spite of the opposition.  His refuge in God was not a place of safety, but the place out of which he received both God’s loving comfort and God’s challenge to him.  It’s what empowered him to push the assumed boundaries of God’s mercy, even when gravely threatened.\\n\\tIn his commentary on this Luke passage, New Testament scholar Matt Skinner raises the question:  but “what if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?”  Isn’t this what the folks in Nazareth were angry about?  Skinner takes a provocative leap himself in an article entitled “Immigration Reform and the Challenges of Generosity.” We too “resist outsiders and their empowerment,” he writes.  “To empower certain people toward citizenship scares many in America,” he continues.  “Do we fear loosing our advantage, our privilege?”  he asks.  In our fear, do we loose track of supporting family unity and hard work and people in need?  “What if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?” asks Skinner (Odyssey Networks, 1/29/13 posting).\\n\\tJesus challenged the hometown crowd to face their own assumptions about preferential treatment.  There had always been tension in ancient Israel between the sense of their being God’s special, chosen people and God’s ongoing outreach to the outsider.  Jesus’ message, the Good News, would be focused on the marginalized, the ones who everyone on the inside were figuring just didn’t belong.\\n\\tEmbracing this Good News is a big order for us Christian community.  Especially since, for most congregations, the marginalized people are both outside and inside the church membership.  I think the apostle Paul really understood how hard it is for a diverse group of people to work together for God’s Kingdom on earth.  His church at Corinth was filled with diverse opinions, various perspectives on the faith, different gifts for ministry.   Our toughest prophetic task is to be the kind of place where theological, economic, sexual orientation and political diversity does not unravel the loving interactions of Falcon Heights Church.  Perhaps our greatest witness as the church is to provide this experience of loving refuge, as it flowers in our patience and kindness with one another.  Encouraged and strengthened in this refuge of love, we are better able to reach out to the outsiders and disempowered beyond our doors.  All this is made possible as we take refuge ourselves in the living, loving God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 27, 2013\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEpiphany 3C\\nEmmaus United Church of Christ\\t\\t\\tI Cor. 12:12-27\\nVienna, VA\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke 4:14-21\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tAnnual Meeting Day\\n\\n\\nTHIS UNEXPECTED FULFILLING\\n\\n\\tThere is a unspoken agreement among most ministers: We think that Jesus had it easy.  This may sound rather startling, or even presumptuous.  But when you get a bunch of clergy-types together, and they invariably start talking about the ups and downs of leading local congregations, Jesus’ everyday ministerial duties look pretty appealing. As an itinerant preacher/teacher/healer, he had a new group of people to talk with every few days, no budgets to debate, no buildings to repair, no difficult Board meetings.  And think of it: no hospital visits because you cure people on the spot!  There were certainly times when Jesus was drained and physically exhausted from his ministry.  But what is missing in Jesus’ work is this very human and fallible institution as we know it today, called “the church.”   Hmmmm,  we ministers think to ourselves….maybe we should all just get spiritual and leave this religious institution stuff behind us!  \\n\\tBut then, darn it, I start reading the Bible again and I am reminded of the great cloud of witnesses that have gone on before us, and the communities of alive people that I am drawn to.  And I remember that it is all about people sharing this experience of the living God with one another and struggling to create ways to live out that experience together.  I read Luke’s account of Jesus’ private spiritual encounter in the desert, filled with temptations to power and glory.  But I am sharply reminded that he doesn’t keep this personal encounter with the divine to himself.  In our text today, Jesus has already returned to his hometown, joining his family and neighbors in worship at their local synagogue.   The time of prayers, singing and Hebrew scripture would have been lay led, with the community’s men stepping forward to read from the scrolls.  Jesus stands and is handed the reading for the day, this portion from the prophet Isaiah:  \\n\\tThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.\\n\\tBy this time in Jewish tradition, these words had been connected to the community’s expectation of the Messiah who would come and transform Israel.  After he has finished reading, Jesus sits down among them.  Without him saying a word more, people know something is up.  All eyes are fixed on him.  From where he is seated, Jesus simply says: Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.  Sounds rather innocuous to us perhaps, but after a few moments, all hell breaks loose.  Jesus starts describing how freeing and healing people is going to challenge the community’s insider status and their neglect of the marginalized in their midst.   And as we will read next week, those in the synagogue are so scandalized by his words that they will chase out of his hometown and try to throw him over a cliff.  Yet another religious institutions at its worst; let’s just be spiritual, okay?\\n\\tOne Biblical commentator on this passages suggests: Note that Jesus reads from their own (his own) Scriptures, which is to suggest that the Bible is both the greatest friend and the greatest enemy of the community of faith. Everything that would challenge us most deeply is right here, right there, in this odd, disordered and difficult book, a book that reads us as much as we read it.  (Anthony Robinson, 1/27/13 lectionary web-blog).\\n\\tPart of what happens to us in religious community is that we allow something bigger than ourselves “reads us.”  Something wider than our own individual insight, even larger than our own collective perspective as a group.  We allow the faith tradition, other congregations, a wider denomination, and a very old book called the Bible, to “read us as much as we read it.”   The Bible becomes both “friend and enemy” to us as individuals and to us as a congregation.  Because the Biblical message has this tenacious way of fulfilling itself as we hear it.  It works in us, if we let it.  \\n\\tTake this passage from the apostle Paul we just heard; a snippet of a letter that he wrote to one of the congregations he started in southern Greece around the middle of the first century.  Having encountered the risen Jesus Christ in a vision, this Greek-speaking Jewish Pharisee gets busy spreading the Good News of new life through the Spirit.  This church in the busy, prosperous and diverse city of Corinth is apparently growing and is filled with conflict.  Groups of people, from various ethnic backgrounds and social classes in the city, would come together regularly in one of their larger homes, for a common meal and worship.   At this point, the word church, or in Greek ekklesia, means simply “a people called” or “the visible assembly.”  It’s about the community for them, the people who are responding to God’s call in Jesus Christ.   And apparently, this “visible assembly” was a mess.  Grumbling and infighting, rival groups trying to gain control.  A reluctance to hold some people accountable for flagrant immorality.  And the less prominent among them, those of lesser means, had been marginalized and ignored.  \\n\\tGood gracious, we might wonder.  If the early church got in trouble so quickly, is that just the way it is going to be for churches?  What does it mean to “be church” in this day and age, when so much church history, and people’s experiences in congregations, can be so difficult?  A good question to consider in light of our Annual Meeting today, when we reflect on this last year and look forward into the next.       \\n\\t\\tHere is where I find the Bible reading me, reading us, today:  here in Paul’s image of the church as the Body of Christ.  In ancient times, the image of the corporate Body was often used to substantiate hierarchies and establish the lowliness of certain classes of people.  But Paul uses the body metaphor to decribe our equality and unity “in Christ” as a follower of the Risen Jesus, and the necessity of all of us for the work of the Gospel.  There can be some comfort in this, as we sink into the love and support of a community.  But this is also incredibly challenging, given our predominant cultural notions of rugged individualism.  In being church together, “the Body of Christ,” we are admitting a communal dependence, bearing each other’s joys and sufferings.  We are fulfilling God’s vision for humanity by hanging in there together.   We are not God’s sons and daughters alone.  This is where “spiritual but not religious” just doesn’t cut it for me.  I don’t follow Jesus by myself, just from my own individual perspective and experience.  As Lillian Daniel, United Church of Christ minister of a church outside of Chicago has written in her new book “When Spiritual But not Religious Isn’t Enough.”  Church, Daniel describes, is where we “step out of ourselves, dare to become a community, and encounter a God greater than we could ever invent.”\\n              A club of people is connected to one another because of a shared\\nsense of preferences, which develop a common purpose and shared tasks.   But a church community is connected together in a different way.  We all have different preferences, because any church is invariably filled with different kinds of people, some of whom we might not naturally rub shoulders with in our weekday world.   It’s our unity in diversity that is so important, and such a powerful witness to the world.  We are drawn together as we experience in worship, fellowship and service, the welcome of other humans and God’s extravagant welcome of us.  In that welcome, by the gathered Body of Christ, we slowly begin to experience the transforming power of God.  Self-judgment and competition softens, we let down our armor a bit, and we start to connect.    \\n\\t\\tThis community is where all of us, the weak and the strong alike, come week after week to get re-oriented, re-formed, given fresh eyes to see God’s world.  Where we develop the perspective and the renewed energy to go out and be part of the freeing and healing of the world around us.  And so it is for us, the Body of Christ.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOnce again, Jesus is sitting around having a meal with people.  But Jesus practices a strange sort of table etiquette.  He seems to be in a habit of offending his hosts, and here in today’s passage from Luke he does it again. Dinner at the local legal experts’, the Pharisees, home, and on a Sabbath evening.  Jesus has just offended his host by curing some man who has wandered on to the scene.  The host’s consternation is not just about uptight legalism. The Sabbath day of rest was an important and vibrant spiritual practice for 1st century Jews.  It reminded them that they were human and not hardier than God, who metaphorically gets a break on the seventh day of Creation story.  \\n\\tBut at tonight’s banquet, Jesus pushes his challenge of the cultural norms even further.   Lavish dinners worldwide have been part of a social elites’ way of establishing power and maintaining connections with other elites. If you invited a fellow elite, that person would be obligated to repay you with a return invitation.   And, in both Jewish and Greco Roman societies, the poor and the physically disabled or sick were to avoided, because of course, “they are not like us and we certainly don’t want to be like them.”  \\n\\tJesus notices the distinguished guests jockeying for position around the table, and admonishes them to take the lower place.  Well, isn’t that just common courtesy, friendliness?  And they might even get the self-serving chance to be invited publicly to the table, notes Jesus.  (I can almost see him slyly smirk to himself as he suggests this).  “Oh, of course; good suggestion, Jesus.”\\n\\tBut does Jesus stop there?  No, he launches into this rather bizarre suggestion that the people you should really invite to your big party are the town low-life, all these losers.  And why will you be blessed for doing this?  Because they can’t repay you!   For Jesus, the true hospitality challenge was to be more than friendly to those who are like you and can return the favor.   I can hear the dinnertable crown begin to gumble, “I don’t know Jesus, maybe I don’t want to be that hospitable, I just want to be friendly.”     \\nTheologian and Anglican priest Cathy Campbell says this about Jesus “table ministry” in her book Stations of the Banquet: Faith Foundations for Food Justice:  “Jesus’ table fellowship, the company he kept, his enjoyment of food and his attention to the customary “rules” of the table are not tangential to his ministry.  Rather, they define his ministry and us as his followers.” (p. 82).  At first glance, it would seem that this story admonishes us to care for the needy, make sure they get fed.  But is Jesus’ proposed feast for society’s outcasts just about benevolence?  Charitable acts of feeding the hungry are clearly important.  But, as usual, Jesus is pressing us to an even greater challenge of true hospitality.\\nNow, any creative host or hostess knows this essential rule:  friendliness is not the same as true hospitality.  The trouble is, I’m afraid most churches don’t know that friendliness and hospitality are quite different.  In fact, many churches that describe themselves as “friendly” are actually declining in membership.  I wonder what that’s all about?   What does it mean to value and practice hospitality as a congregation?\\nLet’s consider our creative host and hostess, inviting a family group into their home.  “Bing bong” goes the doorbell.  “Hi, welcome!  Great to see you!”  “yeah, great to finally be able to get together, and hey thanks for letting us bring a few extra people tonight.”  “No problem!  Come on in,” say the hosts.  Now the hosts and their invited family are standing in the front hall.  Or, in a worship service analogy, the newcomer has now greeted and has been handed a bulletin and offered a seat in the sanctuary.  Very friendly.  Back to our host and hostess.  People are still standing in the front hall.  “May I take your coats, here let’s sit in the living room and have appetizers while dinner cooks.” Most churches get this far; the hymnals, bulletins, Coffee Hour refreshments, are all made available to everyone there.  Although there may not be comfortable room for someone’s wheelchair and not everyone may smile at the small children when they crumple the bulletin and drop their crayons and squirm; not all newcomer’s can easily sing the hymns and many younger people find traditional church music formal, foreign and off-putting.  But the hospitality challenge in most congregations is how the newcomer and stranger is approached after worship: at Coffee Hour and, more importantly how that person is engaged in the week.  Especially if that person doesn’t fit into most churches’ stereotype of church growth:  employed and smart young heterosexual married couple with a few well-behaved kids, ready to give generously and support the church programs and budget.  \\n“When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your siblings or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return and you would be repaid,” Jesus told his dinner host. The Rev. Dr. Campbell suggests that “the table for Jesus is not about building up a cohesive web of mutual obligation among relatives or near neighbors.” (p. 82)  Jesus continued, “But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.” (Luke 14:13).   There is something more than benevolence going on here.  As Campbell describes: “The good and the bad, the righteous and unrighteous, rich and poor are all together at the banquet table.  The ethos of Jesus’ table fellowship is rooted in a vision that is about something more than maintaining a coherent, compatible, even charitable company.” (p. 83).    \\nLet’s go back to our diner hosts, who have thoughtfully provided not\\nonly kid-appropriate nibbles for the little ones who have joined group, but there is a strategic pile of picture books and a box of “lego” toys in a quiet but close nook of the living room.  The college daughter’s awkward boyfriend, added to the party at the last minute, is urged to come and help with the beverages and the great grandmother is given a comfortable chair and a photo album of recent interest, because she can’t join actively in the conversation due to hearing loss.  The new guys on the block, two dad’s with their young daughter, are engaged in a discussion about preschools.  Now this is starting to look like hospitality.  The friend and the unknown, the fit and the less-abled, are welcomed equally.  Each is acknowledged as having different needs and different abilities to involve themselves in what is going on.  \\nIt might sound surprising to hear me say that we don’t come to worship just for our own spiritual refueling and friendship needs.  I believe coming to worship should involve some hard work (I’m not just talking Coffee Hour cleanup here); hospitable relational work sometimes leaves us a bit unsettled or uncomfortable!  When we come in the Sanctuary door, we might ask ourselves, how can I offer myself today?  The writer of Hebrews reminds us very clearly:  “Let mutual love continue.  AND do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.” (Hebrews 13: 1-2).  How can I offer myself and who are the needy that need me?   \\nHow might our practice of hospitality extend into our weekday lives?  Here’s a stretch: How might our practice of radical hospitality influence how we think about the world news?  Jesus’ hospitality practice “emphasized inclusion, the renewal of relationships and access of all to the fullness of God’s love,” concludes Campbell.  How might this practice shape my engaging as a responsible citizen this week?  How might it inform my participating in our democracy, or even in sharing my views with my Congressional leaders about the possible use of US military force in Syria?  What does the radical hospitality of Jesus look like today?  Some things to ponder this week….\\nFollowing Jesus is more than “maintaining a coherent, compatible, even charitable community.”  The diversity of Jesus’ table companions is an ongoing challenge for American congregations, and I think for our country as a whole.  Thanks be to God for our repeated celebration of Jesus’ table fellowship, as we join in Holy Communion this morning.  Winners and losers, sinners and forgiven, all; we gather.  Jesus never said everyone was the same, but he changed the meaning of our categorizing:  the world’s outcasts, people on the margin, are not to be shunned but somehow included.  In our brief moments around the Communion table, sharing the bread and cup together, we practice hospitality and become the vision of Jesus’ inclusive community.  And in so doing, we celebrate that we too are Jesus’ “table companions, the focus of his love.” (page 83).   Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'There once was a United Methodist pastor who was meeting with his congregation’s worship committee talk about Palm Sunday.  The big issue was the palm branches.  “Our budget is tight this year, and you know those palm fronds cost us about a dollar apiece…” cautiously began one committee member.  (They usually had one who leafy palm frond per person – pricey!)  “That’s right,” someone else quickly chimed in, “Is there any way we can avoid paying a buck a branch this year?”  Their pastor reluctantly admitted that of all four gospels in the New Testament, only the Gospel of John talks about palms during Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  Today’s reading from Mark speaks of cloaks and leafy branches being strewn; Luke ignores branches all together and only mentions the cloaks covering Jesus’ path.  The committee at the Methodist church had a humorous interchange some cheaper possibilities: let’s wave local yellow forsythia or pussy willow branches this year! “Here’s an alternative,” sighed the exasperated committee chair: “let’s forget the branches and just toss our coats and jackets into the aisles!”  Seriously, they asked the pastor, what’s so special about palm branches, anyway?  \\nThe pastor realized the discussion needed a broader historical context.  And he told them the story of another palm-branch waving parade marking a memorable military feat in the life of the Jewish people.  This story was well known to people of Jesus’ time, of the Maccabean revolt against the brutal Hellenistic ruler of Israel, the Antiochus Epiphanes.   It’s an old story, this reality of living in your own land that is now dominated by an oppressive power.  We might think of the original native Indian inhabitants of our own country; think of how people in the South felt at the end of the Civil War. There are even some in our own nation who feel they living in an alienated land today, convinced that their government and major institutions are purposely thwarting their religious practices and destroying their way of life.   \\nBack in 167 BCE before Jesus’ birth, Israel strained under a foreign leader who sought to bring the unifying force of Hellenistic culture to the region.   They had enjoyed several centuries of self-rule, after the returned from exile in Babylonian. They had rebuilt their Temple and reorganized their lives around the direction of the holy Law described in the Torah.  But then came Alexander the Great and Hellenistic rule: King Antiochus were deeply offensive to the Jews: he defiled the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem by erecting statue of Zeus inside, and by placing unclean pork-flesh on the High Altar.  The Jews protested mightly, some took up arms;  Antiochus started slaughtering the population of Jerusalem. The citizens’ revolt led by the Maccabee family eventually miraculously removed Antiochus and his Hellenizing influence from power, for a time.  Recorded in the Bible, this story became a model of both spiritual piety and communal hope. The Jewish people began ruling their own nation again, with a triumphal re-entry into Jerusalem of the freed people. They paraded to music and the waving of palm branches.     \\nWe may be surprised by what a “political” statement the palm branches were for Jesus’ followers in first century Jerusalem.   The analogy might seem a bit far-fetched, but it would be like us each waving American flags in worship this morning instead of palm branches.   Maybe a good idea to some; probably provocative and even offensive to others.  Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem carried both religious and political implications that the Biblical story seldom shies from addressing.    \\nThe crowds who watched Jesus enter Jerusalem strained against the increasing tax burden and offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Roman rule.  The memories of the recent Maccabean revolt would still be strong. Their political situation was of deeply religious concern. What was God doing in their midst? The Jews were continuing to live an alienated, occupied land: ruled by idolaters whose policies could at any time affect the operation of the Temple itself and the people’s ability to observe the ordinances of the Torah” (p. 77-78, Linda Fredriksen).  And during this unsettled time, there developed a certain way of understanding God’s actions and the world that give meaning and hope to the unsettling present.   In the middle of the present suffering there was hope for a changed future, which the God’s anointed one, the Messiah, would surely bring. \\nWe can begin to get a sense of how Jesus’ audiences resonated with his preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  They would have understood him primarily through the lense and the longings of this idea of restoration. It had evolved into a hope for universal renewal of the whole world; a restored Israel and morally transformed non-Jews.  But Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of restoration than anyone could imagine.  And it sets him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous for an occupied nation.\\nHe heads to Jerusalem to celebrate the Jewish Passover, the festival commemorating the Jews release from slavery under the Egyptians, centuries before.  Folks there were used to military parades with uniformed Romans riding powerful huge horses through the streets.  Jesus, with a sly sense of humor,  chooses to enter on a donkey, a silly looking young colt.  Is he mocking this common display of imperial power?  Suddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he raises the dead, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   Heads turn and the crowd cheers.  People are now singing hosannas and throwing their cloaks on the road, waving palm branches in the air, and welcoming Jesus like royalty.  But in today’s text we see Jesus still moving, through the town of Bethphage, probably camping out with his caravan of followers on the Mt. of Olives right outside Jerusalem’s city walls.    He will make plans to share his last meal, a Passover supper, with his followers in the upper room; he will ask some of them to stay close and watch with him through his night of prayer in Gethsemane.  Under the cover of darkness he will be arrested, then imprisoned, tried, tortured, and the following day executed.    \\nHoly Week asks us to consider this one who, as the Apostle Paul describes, “emptied himself, taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.  I do not believe this is a time to feel sorry for Jesus, to focus on the pain and suffering he experienced as he was tortured and killed.  That keeps him an object of my pity….and keeps me distant from real issue of following him.  Holy Week  confronts me again with how very different this way of the cross is from the violent formulas for resolving conflict throughout history.  How am I to also suffer, to enter into the kind of self-emptying that Jesus did?  How very tempting it is to quickly move to the “new life” messages of Easter and miss the depths of restoration to which Jesus will call us.\\nDying and rising are central to the transformative love offered to us by God. Jesus knew it is not enough for us to simply lead decent lives.  But suffering as part of discipleship?  As a sign of God’s reign among us?\\xa0What the world sees as Jesus’ downward spiral and defeat, is what God uses to bring new life to our places of suffering, oppression and even death. \\xa0There is Jesus, ahead of us: humbling himself, empting himself, obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.   Holy week lies before us; let us journey with Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.',\n",
       " '(Read by Bill Bair, while I was on vacation)\\nDear Immanuel Church members and friends,\\n\\tIt seems a bit presumptuous of me to model my message to you after the early church apostles.   Actual “letter-writing” may seem a tad old fashioned to many of you, in this day of quick emails and abbreviated text messages.  But I have always loved the quaint way St. Paul and his fellow apostles would begin their epistles to the young churches scattered around the Mediterranean.  They would start first, in the manner of the first century, by identifying themselves: by name and by role.  And so shall I, as I begin this epistle to all of you: Anne, called as a servant of God, Interim Pastor, everyday follower of Jesus.  Next would come the recipient:  To God’s beloved in Cambridge, to those called to be saints in the community of Immanuel United Church of Christ. \\n\\tWe remember that the letters preserved for us in the New Testament were each written by specific individuals to specific communities, as messages of encouragement, challenge and hope. The letters would have been laboriously written on thick rough paper made from grasses or animal skills, with quill pens dipped into precious ink.  Rolled up and tucked into a messengers pouch, the letters would travel over the vast network of roads laid down by the Roman Empire.  How odd that Christianity spreads along these stone highways that carried Roman soldiers into battle; all created by the ruling power who were also persecuting, imprisoning and killing the early Christians.  The letters would be received with great interest by the early churches.  They would be read and re-read in the worship assembly, then would be passed around the community and beyond.  A few of the many written epistles were preserved and later included in the collection of writings we have come to call the New Testament. \\n\\tMy letter will come to you not over Roman roads but over the Internet, in an electornic file downloaded by the Bill and Kim Bair family.  I write to you on a modern laptop in a rustic cabin on the edge of a freshwater pond, in the middle of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This letter has stirred in my heart as I read today’s text from James and reflected on our ministry together.  This letter comes out of my deep affection for all of you, saints of the church that you each are.  \\n\\tYears ago, I served as an interim pastor with a church on the shores of Lake Superior, Minnesota.  A gruff retired gentleman there was one of my harshest critics and also one of the staunchest supporters of my ministry.  The thing I respected about this person was that I always knew where I stood with him, as he would invariably tell me just what he thought.  One day, we were in a meeting together where we were talking about the purpose of the church.  Suddenly, this man spoke up quite forcefully and all eyes turned to him in surprise:  “The church is a school!” he pronounced emphatically.  “Yes,” he insisted, and added a bit more gently, “it should be a school of love….it’s where we should learn how to love.”  \\n\\tI think this is what the writer of the Letter of James is writing about.  Much of his letter focuses on Jesus’ teaching about “loving your neighbor as yourself,” and how important it is to not show partiality among those in the congregation.  Especially towards those in the church with more money and community prestige!  Today’s reading comes about half-way through this short letter where James focuses on one of love’s most important tools: Our tongue; our mouth and what comes out of it: the way our words can either wound or heal.  \\n\\tJames seems to overstate his case as he starts by insisting: “not many of you should become teachers…for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.”  This is a rather unfortunate passage to read right when we are trying to involve more adults in teaching and mentoring youth here at Immanuel!  But perhaps the more important point is the following sentence, where James admits that “all of us make many mistakes.”   Out of our same mouth we bless the Lord and we “curse those made in the likeness of God.”  This is part of our humanness, part of the reason we need to confess our sins regularly.  It’s why we need to learn the art of apologizing.  It’s all part of the reality of living together in community.\\n\\tYou may remember being taught the old adage about how “sticks and stones will break your bones, but names will never hurt you.”   As adults, most of us have realized that this really is not  true.  Words do hurt; they can cut deep and leave raw scars for years.  Of course, we want our children to develop somewhat of a “thick skin” so they can fend-of or simply ignore teasing and taunts.  But as adults, we also know a “thick skin” can get us into trouble in our close relationships, where we hope to share a sense of emotional intimacy.  It can keep us stuck in ourselves; we may simply harden ourselves and lose our ability to be moved by other people’s love.  We find ourselves unable to respond to affirmation and affection.     \\n\\tWe can also get so uptight about what our tongue and mouth might utter, that we stay silent.  We decide to follow the adage: “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”  I remember first hearing this at the dinner table as a child, spoken by my exasperated mother.  My dad was a Navy captain, gone for months at a time at sea.  She was probably often flustered with repeated meal preparation and four whiney children.  According to her, complaints about “brocilli, again?!?”  were to be stifled.  If we didn’t have something nice to say about the dinner she had prepared, we were to stay quiet.  I learned that there was a time and a place for complaints, but it wasn’t at the dinner table as we sat down to eat together.  But I have also learned that this general rule just doesn’t work over the long haul.  Just saying the “nice” things is problematic in a marriage, in a close friendship, and also in a congregation.  We especially need to speak up about the things that bother us in the church, if the church is to be a “school of love” as my Minnesota parishioner suggested.   But how do we speak the truth with love, without causing offense and division?  \\n\\tOur September church newsletter carried a description of the work of our Pastoral Relations Committee.  I hope you have had a chance to read it.  You can find it on our new church website if you misplaced your newsletter; there are also copies on the table at Coffee Hour.  This committee works closely with the pastor to encourage good communication between the pastor and the congregation.  I guess you could say the group helps guide the use of our tongues in church!  But this is not a grievance committee where you get problems solved simply by making complaints to the committee members about the pastor.  The purpose of the committee, which all healthy, functioning churches should have, is to encourage good communication between leaders and the membership.  Unhealthy communication rants and rages, or it simply shuts down.  And then there is the problem of three-way communication:  Say that I am Person A and I am bugged by something Person B has done.  I tell this to Person C, to blow off some steam and maybe in the hopes that Person C will go straighten out Person B without me having to say anything directly.  Person A never talks with person B about what is going on between them.  Sound familiar?  Classic triangling is what this is called in communications jargon. We do this in families, at work and in the church.  The problem is, Person B never really gets to find out directly from Person A what he or she did that was offensive.  There is no chance to clear up misunderstandings, no one gets to directly acknowledge an offense, no apologies can be made if needed, and forgiveness gets stuck.   Mistrust can develop.  We do this in families, at work and in the church.  I suggest that especially in the church, in this “school of love,” we can learn to do things differently.  A Pastoral Relations Committee exists to help us all do that, and can bring people together for safe, honest, and constructive conversations, if only asked.  \\n\\tI love how the church can be a place where we learn how to use the tool of love that is our tongues!  We can learn to bridle sideways and triangling comments and speak the truth directly in love.  We can have our tongues “loosened up” a bit and learn to pray together.  By pondering the Bible texts and singing together each week, we begin to learn a vocabulary of faith.  We can learn to testify to one another about God’s working in our lives.  I give thanks to God for this “school of love” that is Immanuel Church!  \\n\\tAs I close my letter, please know that I hold you all in my prayers, from this distant New England corner of the world!  May the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you.  Amen.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nTHIS GOOD TREASURE\\n\\n\\n\\tEarlier this year, our congregation held an eco-film series for the community.  We showed three films in this Sanctuary, each of which highlighted a different environmental concern that is challenging our world. It was this final film, “Food, Inc” about our national food policy and production, that held the most interest and familiarity for me. I’ve read the latest Michael Pollan books, try to eat green and local. I’ve done meal prep for homeless shelters and collected for food shelves over the years; I get it about the problems with industrialized feedlots, that corn is in most of our processed foods. I know that there is enough food in the world to feed all the hungry people, we just can’t get it together as a human race.  But a few weeks ago, I joined 4 other Emmaus members in watching another film by the same producers, shown over at Bethel UCC Church in Arlington.  It was called “A Place at the Table.”  With a chilling subtitle: “One Nation, Underfed.”   You know how you can hear things over and over and then at some point something clicks in your head?  Or maybe some sense of patience with a problem just evaporates.  I get it that part of our food problem in this country has been that increasingly, the cheapest food to buy are the highest in sugars, salt and fat.  But as I followed the film’s frank and unsettling portrayal of working families in different parts rural, urban and small town America struggling to put healthy food on the table, my heart sank.  This mess feels intractable, I admitted to myself.   Many of these people have jobs and still can’t feed their families adequately.  Even with the panel discussion that followed, with representatives from local groups helping to end hunger locally, a wave of hopelessness came over me.  These are some of the times when I feel my faith being tried; when I wonder how God’s reign of justice, mercy and hope will be made real here on earth.  How and will life here, the way we treat each other, really be transformed?  I feel overwhelmed by the obstacles.   That night I learned that since 1980 fruits and vegetable costs have increased 40% while the cost of processed foods have decreased 40%....primarily because we subsidize commodities like corn, soy and wheat and not the fruits and veggies.   Hence, when you are hungry for a snack, the choice for chips over the apple (if you can even find a fresh apple).  So how in the world will people with limited resources be able to sustainably nourish their families??   Are all things really possible with God, as the scriptures promise?  Is God really “at work within us….accomplishing far more than we can ask or imagine?” as the Apostle Paul claims in one of his letters to the early church?  And then I hear that “each congregation in the US would need to spend $50,000 per year for the next ten years to feed the people who will be affected by proposed cuts to federal food programs.”  Talk about hopelessness….  The needs are so urgent; and I watch my faith in the possibilities for change seem to dwindle along with the supplemental food supplies at the pantries. As we begin our yearly Emmaus food drive to once again collect 1000 food items for our local food shelves and shelters, I’m with Jesus’ disciples from today’s reading: “Lord, increase my faith!”   \\n From our brief Luke passage today, it would seem that the disciples question is a reasonable request:  “Lord, can you increase our faith?!” Jesus has just been talking privately with his friends about the extraordinary demands of following him.  In the verses preceeding these, he insists they were to continually forgive one another: be mutually accountable, lovingly rebuke where necessary, apologize and make amends.  “Do this seven times a day, if you have to.” Living fully in God’s Kingdom was full of more challenges than they had imagined.  “If someone repents, you must forgive,” Jesus pushes them. To which they understandably respond: “good grief, we are going to need more of something to do this.  Jesus, can you give us more faith?!”\\n\\tJesus responds in a curious manner:  “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.”  There is something in the sharpness of Jesus’ answer, the bizarre exaggeration of his images about small seeds and huge deeply rooted bushes, that leaves me wondering if the disciples, and maybe I, have missed the point somewhere.  Is this about MORE faith? Is he is using common images in a cryptic and indirect manner so he can unsettle our assumptions about faith? The disciples assume faith comes in different quantities: if I have the right amount, I can face the challenges of following you, Jesus.  I can valiantly change the world!  But, if I have more of what?  \\n\\tAre we talking about faith like a super-power, so I can somehow manipulate an even bigger super power?   Is faith about somehow twisting my brain around confusing church doctrine and bowing to an external authority or set of beliefs?   I wonder if Jesus turns to irrelevant references to tiny mustard seeds and huge mulberry bushes and tossing follage into the sea because….the disciples are asking an irrelevant question.  It may not be about an amount of faith.  Was Jesus telling them they had all the faith they needed?  He never seemed big on doctrine or beliefs and just had this knack for going up to people and saying “follow me” and they would.  He certainly didn’t check out their “faith status” first. \\n\\tMaybe the disciples question should have been, “Jesus, we need some help here understanding how following you works, about how to be and act faithful.  Jesus, we need some help in learning how to trust God, to trust in God’s steady presence and unfolding plan even when things look bad.”  They may already have this thing they think they need.  A connection with this transforming God.  The disciples may have lost track of what they already have:  not a spirit of cowardace or fear, as the early church missionary Paul describes in his mentoring letter to the young co-worker Timothy.  They have “a source of power and love and self-discipline.”  Lean into it, engage it, will later Paul urge his leader-in-training. Guard this “good treasure entrusted to you….this treasure of faith that comes down from your mother and your grandmother and lives in you, he counsels Timothy. \\n\\tPerhaps when a congregation’s such as ours is faced with overwhelming challenges like world hunger, our question might first be: how do we “guard the good treasure entrusted” in us from generations past here at Emmaus UCC?  How do we stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us?  Because clearly, one of the on-going legacys here at Emmaus has been an abiding concern for those who live in poverty and don’t have enough proper food.  _______________________  This kind of caring and outreach have been part of Emmaus’ identity since it’s formation in the 1960’s.  This is about a level of faithfulness, of trust that our actions make a difference.  One commentator on this Luke passage suggests that “having faith” is not really about having a strong belief in something.  It is when “our whole way of perceiving and responding to life is transformed by the fecundity of God’s creative justice and power.”  Fecundity.  Allowing the inherent fruitfulness of God’s creative justice and power to affect how we perceive and respond to life.  How we perceive and respond to needs around us.  Jesus seemed to think the disciples’ problem wasn’t about an amount of faith; it was about the ways they were with one another, and with God.  A level of trust and patience, honesty and forgiveness.  And spilling out of these right relationships would unfold a generosity that reached beyond itself.\\n\\tEach Sunday we worship together we renew our commitment to faithful action beyond our walls by nurturing these relationships among us.  1000 food items?  We are here, “rekindling our faith,” fueling the embers “power and love and self-discipline” that lie within each of us.  1000 cans and boxes of food?  This is doeable.   And in so doing, we will give thanks for the saints who have gone before us here at Emmaus, the everyday people who stepped forward as faithful leaders and strong workers is this congregation.  What a challenge, what a joy, to follow in their footsteps today.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe 12th Day of Christmas!  Although I love the richness and joy of the Advent and Christmas season, Epiphany comes as a bit of a relief to me.  But these early weeks of the New Year are not just about plunging back into the bracing practicalities of everyday life.  And it’s not just about making lots of stern New Year’s resolutions to whip us into shape.   During Epiphany in the Christian church, we are invited deeper into the mysteries of the showing-forth of Jesus and his power:  We consider anew the epiphany, the manifestation, the revelation of God working through the life, teachings and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.  Each Epiphany, we are once again called to envision how we “share the light” of the Risen Christ in new ways, in this time in history, through this particular church. \\n\\tEpiphany, heralded by stories of the arrival of the Magi at Jesus’ manger, comes at a good time for us as a congregation.  I have been with you just over a year as your interim minister.  We are at the point in our interim work where we have some emerging clarity about Emmaus’ history, core values and basic beliefs.  It is not unusual for some members to feel that such a reflective discovery process drags on too long; “let’s get a new permanent minister already,” or, “I think I’ll wait on the sidelines until I see who the next settled minister is before committing myself.”   Others have expressed gratefulness for all our small group gatherings in which there has been repeated opportunity to talk to one another, to listen to one another in safe, non-judgmental settings.  “Our church is more than just the minister,” and “we have needed this healing time,” I have been glad to hear a number of you explain to me.  And these calm, Discovery Team led community-building experiences have been just as important as the data gleaned from these numerous gatherings.   The “this is who Emmaus has been and who Emmaus is today” question is getting addressed.  Now we are moving into the “so what?” part.  If a church isn’t a social club or another non-profit, led by the personal preferences or individual visions of a group of like-minded people…then what are we?  \\n\\tFirst and foremost, a church is a people led by God, following the illuminating way of Jesus, inspired by this mystery we call the Holy Spirit.  It’s not just about us or a democratic sharing of our opinions.  It’s about God’s yearning for connection with the human race and God’s invitation for us to co-partner with God in the healing and transformation of the world.   The church that thrives and grows is continually seeking to learn and experience more about this still-speaking God, and to learn and experience more about the needs of the world.  \\nDuring the Season of Epiphany in January and February, we cycle back into the stories of how Jesus’ contemporaries witnessed his compassion and understood his power.   These are our foundational texts as Christians!   We return to these stories each year, seeking deeper understanding of this one who both comforts those who suffer and one who makes uncomfortable those complacent in their positions of status, wealth and power.  And as a congregation this year, we will consider together just what these texts might suggest for Emmaus’ future.  During Epiphany, the Discovery Team will be doing what they have dubbed a “mission field survey.”  Someone once asked Jesus:  who is my neighbor?  It turned out to be a group of people the questioner least expected or desired for a neighbor.  For Emmaus, this is a hugely important question: who is our neighbor now?  We are interested in not just the material needs of the poor around us, but also of the spiritual needs of those the needy AND those who don’t appear to need much.   With clarity about who Emmaus is now and what the needs are out there, what is God calling us to do in the near future?  This is the stuff of vision:  what is God saying to each of us about the future church that Emmaus needs to be?\\n\\tWhether this encounter between the Holy Family and the manger late-comers literally happened, we will never know.  But this tale of the wiremen, the magi from the East, takes the Jesus birth narratives in an unexpected direction.  It is found only in the Gospel of Matthew, and is laced with references to ancient Hebrew Scriptures, contemporary political realities and recent celestial events.  The story features a wild mix of exotic strangers who come probably from Persia; it describes a star that moves through the night sky, and a sly, paranoid and murderous local ruler Herod.  Its inclusion appears to be Matthew’s attempt to remind his late first-century Jewish Christian congregation that Jesus had an early relationship with non-Jews.  So?  Including non-Jewish newcomers was a matter of much contention in Matthew’s late first-century church.  They were reluctant to open their doors to non-Jewish Christians, to this Gentile world that didn’t know and accept their customs, their scriptures, and their rituals.  \\n\\tPart of our visioning process might be a serious look at who we feel hesitant about fully welcoming.  Here’s a possible example: While this congregation went through discussion and vote on becoming an “Open and Affirming” congregation about seven years ago, this reality seems to have been only minimally publicized.  Over a thousand UCC churches have gone through this educational and spiritual process across our country, designed to welcome the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgendered community in a time when they are still vociferously excluded and vilified by many Christian traditions.  But what might it look like to be truly open to and affirming of LGBT individuals here at Emmaus?  While I was out at our biannual national gathering of the United Church of Christ, General Synod held in southern California this last summer, I met with a group of people exploring the wider implications of being an “Open and Affirming” congregation.  It appears that many UCC churches have some discussion and take a vote, and then do….well, not much.  Some cited concerns that their churches would become known as the “gay church in town.”  “Let’s down-play this one a bit, as we really do welcome everyone.”  \\n\\tThose of us at General Synod were interested to learn the results of denominational research indicating that it is the congregations widely publicizing their O and A position that are growing the fastest.  I heard of successful outreach programs to gay elders in nursing homes, of anti-bullying work with gay teens in schools, sanctuaries used for same-gender weddings.  Research was shared indicating that new people coming into these congregations certainly include the LGBT community, but also in equal numbers they include young straight couples who want to raise their children in an inclusive, open and affirming environment.  In discussing this finding with several young member families at Emmaus since then, I have discovered that Emmaus’ O and A position is one of the primary reasons they first came here.  Said one young father, “it was a deal breaker for us…had to be an O and A church.”  What might it be like one of the Christian churches in the area sending a strong welcoming statement out into the darkness of homophobia?  \\nAs Matthew tells his story of the miraculous birth, it becomes one that is so incredible that even the stars in the sky respond and lead mysterious outsiders to Jesus birthplace.  Did these start foreign scientist-priests read a particular comet or planetary conjunction as a sign that a new king would come and protect Israel?  We only know that these non-Jews, these Gentiles outsiders, read the skies and recognized Jesus’ birth for the cosmic event that it was.   They perceived a vision and headed out into the unknown.  \\n “Arise, shine;” wrote the Hebrew prophet Isaiah to the people Israel, “arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.”  This is the call of the Christian community, to always be arising, to be getting up again and again, and shining and moving out into a world of darkness.  May the vision for this arising and shining be revealed among us.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' \\tThe Biblical Christmas narrative is easy to miss in the holiday swirl.  It brings such a mix of humble and homely details, as well as extraordinary proclamations of the miraculous.  At times it seems like a rather bizarre ancient story. Our minds grapple intellectually, trying to make theological sense out of the Christmas Mystery, with what we have heard in the texts, the carols, through December.  “O Come, Emmanuel,” our choir sang each Sunday as we began our worship liturgy.  How do we understand this request? Come, Emmanuel, O God-with-us?   God has become with-us, incarnate in Jesus, but how? In what way? And why? What does all this have to do with God and me, we might wonder.  Is there a God and me?  What difference does this make in my life?  The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome, it calls out the prophetic voice.  What does this mean for me now? we ask ourselves.  What does this mean for our church, now?  What is this revelation of the divine, of the supernatural we might say, in human life?  By the time I get to Epiphany, the 12th day of Christmas, I am again struck by this reality:  you and I don’t get to have sweet baby Jesus for ourselves, tucked around the manger, feeling cozy.  Christian faith is not a private matter, or just about being close to other people. If our Christian values and beliefs, our sense of connection with God through the teachings and living presence of Jesus, aren’t just private or familial, then what?   I think all of this has to do with us being in the world in a totally different way.  \\nMy hunch is that this is why the Gospel of Matthew included the story of the Magi, following a star to Jesus’ birthplace, in his birth stories.  Foreigners, outsiders, non-Jews, probably Persian astronomers who served as a type of high priests in the Zoroastrian religion, arriving from the East.  No other Gospel writer includes this part of the birth story.  \\n“Magi” is a Greek word for wise ones or astrologers, and I think this tale pulls us out of our private, familial and familiar world.  They travel over 1000 miles from far-away, exotic Persia, bringing gifts that foretell both a glorious and somber future for the newborn King.  We hear the echo of the Isaiah prophecy:  gold, for a king; frankincense, the incense burned in the Jewish Temple, its smoke lifting up the prayers of the people; myrrh, the spice associated with burial practices.  Such weird baby gifts!  Political implications arise as the magi encounter the wicked and desperate King Herod.  A fawning puppet ruler indebted to the occupying Roman Imperial power; Herod is panicked at news of a possible rival in this new child.  He ends up massacring all Jewish baby boys in the region in a desperate attempt to stop Jesus’ assumed rise to political power.  Joseph and Mary receive the magi, and the strangers’ curious gifts, only to soon flee Bethlehem after being warned in a dream of Herod’s malicious intent.  \\n\\tBiblical scholars have noted that Matthew’s late first century church included many non-Jewish Gentiles.  Perhaps this magi story was Matthew’s attempt to remind his community that Jesus was connected to non-Jews. There was considerable debate at this time about whether the Jesus Way was simply a reform movement within Judaism, or was it the opening up of the Jewish tradition to outsiders in a new way?  Matthew was trying to show how outsiders from another religion and culture fit into the Jewish Jesus’ story from the very beginning!  Resistance to newcomers who are different from us is not new.\\nThis Epiphany, I’m encountering this magi story from a place of curiosity about the way we resist newcomers, people who are different from us.  I’m increasingly concerned about how this resistance happens within our community locally, our churches, our nation as a whole, and most disturbingly, I am having to notice, within myself.  After our two book discussions this fall, I continue to grapple with understanding our nation’s conflict around strangers among us: our current immigration crisis and the wild variety of reactions to it.  To cope with some of my overwhelm about this situation, I’ve been reading Joanna Macy and Chris Johnstone’s book “Active Hope:  How to Face the Mess We’re in without Going Crazy.”  Joanna Macy is a scholar of Buddhism who has spent many years helping both peace activists and now those working to stem the tide of climate change, to deal with their sense of frustration and despair.  The authors describe ways to acknowledge the pain, grief and hopelessness we feel about the state of the world, while seeing ourselves, each other and our planet in a new light of connectedness.   I’ve found myself wondering how this approach might impact our own working through the mess of pain, grief and even hopelessness regrading past few years of conflict in this congregation.  Reaffirming connectedness and mutually accountability to one another.  \\nThen I noticed in a recent News Herald article about our County Commissioners considering a vote regarding refugees in our county.  This upcoming vote is in response to the Executive directive/order from the President in September regarding local immigration.  The directive asks that elected county leaders across the country vote on whether or not they are welcoming of official refugees, those who have received that designation through a long government vetting process, and to do so by the end of this month.  Our Cook County Commissioners will revisit this at their next meeting on Jan 14. 14. Hmmmmm, I thought.  This is an interesting synchronicity, in my mind.  I plan to attend; anyone willing to join me?  What are the values we hold in common as a church that speak to this issue of welcoming refugees, people different, from us fleeing persecution and needing a new place to start their lives over?\\nJoanna Macy’s challenge about our connectedness comes to mind….seeing the “other” in a new light.  Perhaps the season of Epiphany is letting the Light of Jesus Christ begin to see some things differently.  We are part of a Biblical tradition of radical hospitality to the stranger, to the sojourner in our midst.  This openness and welcome and care for the immigrants and refugees among us was deeply imbedded in middle eastern tradition, and hugely reinforced in the teachings of Jesus. The welcoming of immigrants and refugees also has been an important part of our history as a nation, although there have been times when exclusionary racist views have kept people of color and people of different religions from being included in that welcome, be they anyone looking vaguely Asian, or people of color or non-Protestant Christians. How welcoming do we want to be as a nation, as a community, as a church?  What might this radical form of Biblical hospitality require of us in this time? \\nAs we struggle to make sense of the Christmas mystery, I suggest we continue to soak in these stories.  Today, a tales of strangers bringing news of a new born king.  This possibility that we are all welcome into God’s embrace, even when we feel far off.  We are all bathed in this Light, even as we encounter darkness is so much of our lives and the world around us.  We are called to reflect this Light out into the world in new ways.  Amen.']"
